"Jet Airways: Rescind Jet Airways resolution plan, order liquidation, SBI tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rescind-jet-airways-resolution-plan-order-liquidation-sbi-tells-sc/articleshow/114300003.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved verdict on the plea of SBI-led lenders’ consortium seeking scraping of the three-year-old Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan of Murari Jalan-Florian Fristch for revival of bankrupt Jet Airways under IBC on the ground that the successful resolution applicant has failed to deposit even the first tranche of Rs 350 crore.Additional solicitor general N Venkataraman with SBI counsel Sanjay Kapur told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that the SRA has floundered at the inception stage every step of the resolution plan, which warranted upfront deposit of Rs 350 crore, which was part of the Rs 4,783 crore payment the SRA was to pay over five years.The Jalan-Fristch consortium, the successful resolution applicant (SRA), has so far deposited only Rs 200 crore with an additional bank guarantee of Rs 150 crore and failed to comply with the SC order that extended time for payment of balance Rs 150 crore by Jan 31 this year, the ASG said.SBI-led consortium said the RP was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in June 2019 when the airport dues payable by Jet Airways were Rs 240 crore, which after five years have spiraled to Rs 11,00 crore. The SRA cannot escape this liability nor the mandate to pay the statutory dues of Jet Airways employees amounting to Rs 226 crore, it said.Jalan-Fristch was to deposit Rs 475 crore towards airport dues within 180 days of the effective date of the RP. Moreover, the SRA till date does not have a Air Operation Certificate, which was valid till September 3 last year and was extended till June this year on NCLAT orders.Seeking setting aside of NCLAT’s March 12 order and rescinding of the RP for Jet Airways, the SBI-led consortium said, “The SC should direct liquidationof Jet Airways invoking its omnibus powers under Article 142 to prevent further litigation.”It sought appropriation of Rs 200 crore and invocation of bank guarantee for Rs 150 crore deposited by Jalan and Fristch and requested the SC to direct the latter “to pay airport dues which stood at Rs 1,100 crore.”“There has been inordinate delay and utter non-cooperation at every stage and right from the beginning, Jalan-Fristch had no inclination to execute the plan and valuable time of more than 2.5 years had been lost since the NCLT passed on June 22, 2021, approving the resolution plan. The SC should therefore impose huge damages for the loss of valuable and irretrievable time,” it said.For the SRA, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Sankaranarayanan told the court that the SRA has done its best and met the condition precedents, but the SBI-led consortium has adopted a non-cooperation approach right from the beginning. They said the SRA is still willing to work out modalities to revive Jet Airways.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved verdict on the plea of SBI-led lenders’ consortium seeking scraping of the three-year-old Rs 4,783 crore resolution plan of Murari Jalan-Florian Fristch.

India Canada News: Justin Trudeau alone responsible for damage to India-Canada relations: MEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-confirms-india-on-trudeaus-admission-of-not-providing-hard-proof-on-nijjar-killing/articleshow/114297476.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that Trudeau's testimony before a public inquiry only confirms what New Delhi has been saying from the start—that Canada has provided no evidence to support the serious allegations made against India.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar’s assassination last year. Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time. He said, ""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point.""""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was...give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said let's work together,"" Canadian PM said.India swiftly rejected Trudeau’s statements, with MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, ""What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along—Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations it has levelled against India and Indian diplomats."" Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau’s responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar’s killing in British Columbia in June last year. India labelled the claims as “absurd” and part of a broader political move by Trudeau.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation. In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler. The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism. India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Canada’s initial accusation, made without clear evidence, had strained an already delicate relationship, especially over the issue of Canada allowing pro-Khalistani activities on its soil. India has consistently criticised Canada for providing space for such elements, accusing them of operating with impunity.","India has responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police have revealed that the plot to assassinate NCP leader and former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddiqui had started three months ago. The accused had visited Baba Siddiqui's residence multiple times without carrying any weapons, as per the Mumbai police.Based on the information obtained from the Mumbai Crime Branch, the entire plot to murder Baba Siddiqui was orchestrated in Pune.The Mumbai Crime Branch has recorded statements from over 15 individuals, including several eyewitnesses who were present at the scene of the incident.In connection with the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, the Mumbai Police has taken another individual into custody, alleging that he supplied funds and weapons for the crime. Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case. On Tuesday, a court remanded him to police custody until October 21.""Nisad worked as a scrap dealer in Warje area of Pune city,"" said a police official. A team from the Mumbai crime branch apprehended him in Bahraich on Monday.Previously, the police had arrested Gurmail Baljit Singh (23) from Haryana, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap (19) from Uttar Pradesh, both alleged shooters, and ""co-conspirator"" Pravin Lonkar from Pune.Shivkumar Gautam, another suspected shooter who also hails from Bahraich, remains at large.During Nisad's appearance before additional chief judicial magistrate V R Patil, the police informed the court that he had provided financial assistance to the co-accused and that further investigation was required to establish ""the upper link and lower link"" regarding the financial support and determine how he procured the weapons used in the crime.Nisad and Kashyap are from the same village as the wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam.Ajay Dubey, Nisad's lawyer, opposed the remand plea, arguing that the accused was a ""victim of circumstances and a scapegoat."" However, the magistrate acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and deemed his custodial interrogation necessary.According to the police, Nisad, along with Kashyap, Gautam, Pravin Lonkar, and Pravin's brother Shubham, was involved in the conspiracy to kill Siddique.On Saturday night, Baba Siddique (66), a former Congress leader who had recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party, was ambushed by three individuals in Mumbai's Nirmal Nagar area, just outside the office of his MLA son Zeeshan Siddique , and shot.The Mumbai crime branch has assembled various teams to apprehend Shivkumar Gautam, accused Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar, and other individuals wanted in connection with the case.According to officials, the crime branch is exploring various angles, including the possibility of a contract killing, business or political rivalry, or threats related to a slum rehabilitation project.","Harishkumar Balakram Nisad (23), originally from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, is the fourth person to be arrested in the case.

London sides with Ottawa in diplomatic row with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/london-sides-with-ottawa-in-diplomatic-row-with-india/articleshow/114294849.cms,"Representational image

LONDON: The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) issued on Wednesday a statement siding with Canada in the diplomatic firestorm that has erupted between Ottawa and New Delhi, saying India’s “cooperation with Canada’s legal process was the right next step”.The FCDO issued a strongly worded statement “on the ongoing Canadian investigation linked to the govt of India”.The heading, in big bold letters, read: “Canadian investigation linked to the Govt of India.”The statement quoted an FCDO spokesperson as saying: “We are in contact with our Canadian partners about the serious developments outlined in the independent investigations in Canada. The UK has full confidence in Canada’s judicial system. Respect for sovereignty and the rule of law is essential…”The diplomatic row had erupted on Monday when India withdrew its high commissioner, Sanjay Verma, and five other diplomats from Canada and expelled six Canadian diplomats from India, including the acting high commissioner. The MEA said it was a response to a diplomatic communication it had received from Canada on Sunday suggesting that Verma and the other diplomats are “persons of interest” in the investigation into the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a separatist advocating the creation of Khalistan who was designated a terrorist by India.The same day Canadian police held a press briefing and claimed they had “multiple ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the govt of India in serious criminal activity in Canada” and accused agents of India’s govt of being involved in “homicides, extortions and other criminal acts of violence” in Canada and of coercing individuals and businesses to “collect information” to “target members of the South Asian community” in Canada.Overseas Friends of BJP UK president Kuldeep Singh Shekhawat said: “For the Canadian PM to survive the next year until the elections, he needs NDP’s support, otherwise his govt will fall. It looks like Jagmeet Singh has made a condition of his support to Trudeau being that Trudeau should malign India and Indian diplomats. India has nothing to hide or ignore. Pointing fingers at India is not the solution. The Canadian PM has to clean his own house. His political compulsions are destroying India-Canada relations. I think the UK should put some sense into Justin Trudeau and make a mature statement.No govt in the world, not even Pakistan, has accused India of such a criminal nexus.”An Indian diplomatic source told TOI: “The Canadian PM has lost.”The Friends of India Society International UK described the FCDO statement as ""disappointing"" and ""lacking substance”. It said it was surprised to see the UK ""supporting the Justin Trudeau govt"" even after knowing that ""the Canadian govt has not yet submitted any concrete evidence to prove their allegations on Indian officials' involvement in the whole matter.”""Allegations without evidence carry no weight. On the other hand, when the Indian govt has submitted multiple dossiers proving the involvement of Khalistan separatists supporting terrorist activities in India from Canadian soil, no action has been taken by the Canadian govt yet,"" it said.","The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) issued a strongly worded statement “on the ongoing Canadian investigation linked to the govt of India” The statement quoted an FCDO spokesperson as saying: “We are in contact with our Canadian partners about the serious developments outlined in the independent investigations in Canada’s judicial system”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114294846,imgsize-211716,width-400,resizemode-4/114294846.jpg"
Justin Trudeau: 'No hard proof when we made first allegation ... ': Trudeau now admits amid diplomatic row with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-hard-proof-when-we-made-first-allegation-trudeau-now-admits-amid-diplomatic-row-with-india/articleshow/114291387.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

In a surprising admission, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a prominent Khalistani extremist. The revelation comes at a time of escalating tensions between India and Canada , raising questions about the diplomatic storm that followed these unsubstantiated allegations.Trudeau, who was testifying before the foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that when his government implicated New Delhi in Nijjar's assassination last year, they were acting on weak intelligence rather than definitive proof.Trudeau said, ""Over the course of summer I was apprised by intelligence services that govt was involved in the killing of Nijjar, there was not an obvious immediate international nexus... In August, intelligence from Canada and The Five Eyes made it clear that india was involved...agents from India were involved on Canadian soil and told them we have real concerns that your security agencies are involved. India's response to our investigation was to double down on attacks against our government...We told India it is not hard evidence but it is just intelligence at that point...India undermined our government and governance...These were clear indications that India has violated our sovereignty""He further said, ""They [India] asked us how much do you know? Give us the evidence you have on this and our response was well, its within your security agencies, you should be looking into how much they know you should be engaging.""""They [India] asked to show the evidence, and at that point, it was primmarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof,"" Trudeau said, underscoring the fragile basis of the initial accusations.The timing of Trudeau's confession coincides with an explosive claim by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a designated Khalistani terrorist and leader of the banned group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Pannun revealed that he had been in contact with Trudeau’s office for the past three years, regularly sharing information—further complicating the narrative of Canadian-Indian relations.This diplomatic row erupted when Canada labeled India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar’s death. India swiftly denounced the allegations, dismissing them as ""preposterous"" and part of Trudeau's political maneuvering.The fallout saw India recall its High Commissioner from Canada, followed by Ottawa expelling six Indian diplomats. In retaliation, New Delhi ordered six Canadian diplomats to leave before October 20, signaling a deepening divide between the two nations.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

"No bilateral but India, Pak ‘break the ice’ with Jaishankar visit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bilateral-but-india-pak-break-the-ice-with-jaishankar-visit/articleshow/114294069.cms,"Modi, Sharif likely to come face to face at COP29 in Nov



ISLAMABAD: External affairs minister S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days even though there was no formal bilateral meeting between the foreign ministers on the margins of the SCO heads of government summit in Islamabad, diplomatic sources said. The fact that the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost 9 years went off without a hitch was seen as a positive development by the Indian government.As he departed after a 24-hour stay in Islamabad from the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, Jaishankar, who had said recently India isn’t passive on Pakistan and will react to positive and negative developments accordingly, thanked Shehbaz and Dar in a post on X for the hospitality and courtesies.While Indian government sources described the talks as casual conversations, Pakistan officials said there was a brief pull aside, which lasted for 5 to 7 minutes, between Jaishankar and Dar on the sidelines of the dinner hosted by Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday evening. Pakistan’s interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is learnt to have joined Jaishankar and Dar.A source speaking on condition of anonymity said Pakistan suggested resumption of bilateral cricketing ties as a way of “breaking the ice”. Naqvi was later quoted as saying that Jaishankar’s visit was an ice-breaker even though neither side proposed a bilateral meeting. Pakistan is looking to host the Champions Trophy next year and would like India to participate.The relationship between the 2 countries has remained in deep-freeze since the abortive bid to resume the dialogue process in 2015 under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. Things only worsened after Pakistan recalled its high commissioner in August 2019, following India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K.Indian government sources appreciated the fact that Shehbaz didn’t rake up any bilateral issue in his remarks as the host of the summit.While Jaishankar’s remarks on terrorism were seen as a message for Pakistan, Indian sources said the minister had only spoken about issues that the SCO has identified as key challenges and that other member-states can also relate to.Jaishankar is learnt to have had another extended conversation with Dar at the SCO lunch table on Wednesday where both were seated next to each other. “It wasn’t initially planned that way but later they sat together and spoke over lunch in the presence of other delegates,’’ said.Both sides denied that there was any proposal for resumption of dialogue. Shehbaz and Indian PM Narendra Modi are expected to come face to face next month at COP29 in Azerbaijan but for any substantive engagement, India will want Pakistan to first reappoint high commissioner.After his return from Pakistan, Jaishankar said in another post on X that India made a positive and constructive contribution to the talks in Islamabad and identified 8 takeaways from India’s perspective from the documents that were signed. These included upholding fair and balanced connectivity projects in accordance with international law, the goals and principles of the UN Charter and SCO Charter and a fair, open, inclusive and transparent multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Significantly, another Pakistan minister, Ahsan Iqbal, had told visiting Indian journalists on Tuesday that Pakistan wants the 2 countries to return to the 1999 Lahore Declaration that called upon both sides to refrain from intervening and interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Shehbaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif, who reached the agreement with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee, has repeatedly accused former president Pervez Musharraf of scuttling the Declaration through his Kargil adventurism.","S Jaishankar had ""casual conversations"" with both Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and his counterpart Ishaq Dar over the past 2 days.

"SCO must root out terrorism, respect territorial integrity: Jaishankar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-must-root-out-terrorism-respect-territorial-integrity-jaishankar/articleshow/114294031.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Combating terrorism , extremism and separatism – characterised as “3 evils’’ by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) since its inception in 2001 – is essential for the Eurasian group to realise its goals of balanced growth and integration, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said, addressing the 23meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad.However, Jaishankar did not name or single out Pakistan and ensured his remarks fell strictly under the ambit of the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow bilateral issues to be raised at the forum.Without skirting round the issue of terrorism though, the minister said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchangesJaishankar sought an honest conversation on the issue saying, “if trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address”. He said attaining these original SCO objectives was even more important in an uncertain world marred by conflicts and debt.“It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the three evils,’’ said the minister.In a message to both China and Pakistan, the minister also said SCO cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and connectivity must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. “It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas,’’ said the minister, adding cooperation can’t progress if global practices are cherry-picked, especially of trade and transit.India was again the only country in SCO to not endorse China’s BRI in the SCO joint statement. BRI’s flagship China Pakistan Economic Project ( CPEC ) passes through PoK, which India sees as under illegal occupation of Pakistan. Since it became a full member of SCO in 2017, India has repeatedly reminded member-states that it’s important for them to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. China was represented by Premier Li Qiang in the meeting.The minister also spoke about the need to make the UN Security Council more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. “The SCO must be in the lead of advocating such change, not hold back on a matter of such importance,’’ said the minister. China is the only P5 country not to publicly declare support for India’s UNSC permanent membership bid.“While we each make our contribution, the world order is more than the sum of its parts. As it changes, global institutions do need to keep pace. That is why the case for ‘reformed multilateralism’ gets stronger by the day. Comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, both in the permanent and non-permanent categories, is essential,’’ said the minister.","S Jaishankar said activities across borders characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism would be detrimental to trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.

While sticking to his allegation that Indian agents killed pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said that he lacked “evidentiary proof” but only had intelligence when he first went public with the accusations last year.Testifying before Foreign Interference Commission, he admitted Canada had not shared any evidence with India but only sought to work together and New Delhi kept demanding proof.“Our response was, well, it’s (proof) within your security agencies,” he said. Later, he told the inquiry panel looking into surveillance of two Conservative lawmakers that there were “clear indications India had violated Canada’s sovereignty”, stopping short of repeating the claim they had shared “evidence” of Indian govt’s complicity in Nijjar’s killing.Trudeau’s choice of words echoed what govt officials in New Delhi have been saying for a year that Canadian authorities have not shared any evidence to back their claims.Trudeau, who is grappling with a big loss in public support, sought to play on the sovereignty of Canada and repeatedly tried to bracket India with China and Russia.“Indian govt made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada, and we need to respond,” Trudeau said.He said Canadian police started probing the Nijjar murder after “credible intelligence” and demands from South Asian members of parliament and those from the community who alleged an Indian hand. He said he was briefed about it in late July or early Aug.“I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the govt of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil,” Trudeau said.He said his govt could have chosen to make it “very uncomfortable” for India by going public just before the G20 Summit in Sept 2023 but chose to work with Indian govt. Trudeau also said when he raised the issue with PM Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 meeting, the latter’s response was not helpful. “He responded with the usual response that ‘we have people, who are outspoken and speaking against India, living in Canada that we would like to see arrested’,” Trudeau said, while seeking to defend the “freedom of expression” of several persons whom India sees as pro-Khalistan separatists.",Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said that he lacked “evidentiary proof” but only had intelligence when he first went public with the accusations last year.

I announce Saini as the leader of the legislature party,"" Shah said.On March 12, when BJP named Saini as Manohar Lal Khattar's successor during a meeting held at Haryana Niwas, Chandigarh, Vij had abruptly left the meeting, abandoned his security and took a private car to reach his residence in Ambala. Rumours swirled that Vij, a seasoned neta, was unwilling to accept the junior Saini as his superior. Further signalling his discontent, Vij declined any ministerial roles in Saini's cabinet after the latter took oath on March 13.Although Vij and Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh had indicated during the campaign that they were contenders for CM's job, the leadership always appeared to be favourably inclined towards Saini. Though backed by Khattar, Saini's affable style and accessibility helped sand out the unpleasant memories of the two tenures of his predecessor who had earned goodwill by bringing transparency in recruitment to put an end to the ""cash-for-jobs"" scheme widely perceived to have been rampant under Congress's decade-long run, but whose ""rough and brusque"" style during his second term created a wall between the government and the people. Saini managed to bridge that gap, while his OBC background turned out to be a big electoral plus.Besides backing of OBCs, support of Dalits played a major role in BJP's surprise victory and Modi's choice of Valmiki Jayanti for the swearing-in is seen simultaneously as a thanksgiving gesture to Dalits and a celebration of the defeat of Congress's narrative that BJP was plotting to abolish caste quotas.Sources said Modi pencilled in the birth anniversary of the author of Ramayana as soon as he was presented with a set of options.The PM also scheduled a meeting of CMs and deputy CMs of 16 NDA-governed states in Chandigarh on Thursday. Leaders of all NDA parties will be present in what is expected to be a major show of strength before the Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls.At the BJP meeting, Shah said it was the first time that a party had returned to office for the third time in a row in Haryana and credited Modi for the victory. ""Since our PM had been in-charge of the state for BJP, he has great understanding about the needs, issues and problems of the people of Haryana. When he was sworn in as PM for the first time, we decided to fight polls without any alliances and formed the government. Khattar worked for nine-and-a-half years before the party utilised his services at the Centre and appointed Saini as the CM. Now, we have contested and won the election under his leadership,"" Shah said.Others present in the meet included BJP's poll in-charge for Haryana Dharmendra Pradhan and co-in-charge Biplab Deb, Union ministers Khattar & Rao Inderjit Singh.Hours after the meeting, Saini met Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya and staked claim to form the government.",Nayab Singh Saini will take oath as Haryana CM Thursday. PM Modi chose date to mark anniversary of sage Valmiki. Home minister Amit Shah enlisted the party's senior-most legislator Anil Vij. Vij had staked claim to the CM's post during the campaign.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114294247,imgsize-1524532,width-400,resizemode-4/114294247.jpg"
Railways told to pay Rs 4.7 lakh to passenger for bag theft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-told-to-pay-rs-4-7-lakh-to-passenger-for-bag-theft/articleshow/114294802.cms,"NEW DELHI: Citing that the passenger had taken ""reasonable precautions"" to safeguard his luggage but the TTE failed in his responsibility to prevent entry of ""outsiders"" in the reserved coach, NCDRC has ordered Railways to pay nearly Rs 4.7 lakh compensation to the traveller whose belongings were stolen. The incident happened on Amarkantak Express in May 2017.Passing the order Monday, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) dismissed Railways' argument that under Section 100 of Railway Act its administration is not responsible for loss, destruction or deterioration unless a railway man has booked the luggage and given a receipt. Imposing a cost of Rs 20,000 on Railways for causing mental agony to the passenger, an NCDRC bench comprising Justice Sudip Ahluwalia and Rohit Kumar Singh, said, ""...it is concluded that Railways is liable for the theft, and there was deficiency in service provided to the petitioner (passenger) owing to negligence of railway officials concerned."" The Railways owe a duty of care towards passengers travelling in a reserved coach with their personal belongings and luggage, it said.NCDRC passed the order while hearing a revision petition filed by Durg-based Dilip Kumar Chaturvedi against the order of Chhattisgarh State Consumer Commission.The case dates back to May 9, 2017, when Chaturvedi with his family was travelling from Katni to Durg in a sleeper coach. He had lodged an FIR with railway police about his luggage - cash and articles of around Rs 9.3 lakh in value - being stolen around 2.30am. He then filed a case in the Durg district consumer commission, which directed South East Central Railway GM, Durg station master, and Bilaspur GRP thana in-charge to pay the claimed amount. But, the respondents challenged the order in the state commission, which quashed the district commission's order.Chaturvedi filed a revision petition before NCDRC, submitting that the TTE and railway police staff were grossly negligent in allowing ""unauthorised persons"" in the reserved coach. His counsel submitted that the stolen luggage was duly chained and the defence of section 100 cannot be extended in case of negligence.",The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) ordered Railways to pay nearly Rs 4.7 lakh compensation to the traveller whose belongings were stolen.

NEW DELHI: A statement by one of the top functionaries of Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) about Pakistan ’s involvement in stoking pro-Khalistan movement in Canada has deepened doubts about the motives of the powers-that-be in Ottawa.Venessa Llyod, interim director of CSIS, appeared before Foreign Interference Commission in Sept and was asked by the commission’s lead counsel Shantona Chaudhury about this.Lloyd said, “Pakistan’s engagement is consistently in balance with trying to reduce the influence of India... Influence of Pakistan is directly related to support of Khalistani extremism .”Lloyd’s testimony ties in with India’s long-standing grouse that Khalistani extremists who have found shelter in Canada have been enlisted by Pakistan in its campaign against India. “You don’t have to take our word. This is what your own security and intelligence tzarina has to say. She has no dog in this fight,” said a senior govt source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“Why are they not outraged over this?” he asked, a remark that reflected the suspicion in official circles that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau , in escalating the disagreement between the two countries to near-breaking point, has been motivated by considerations other than “concocted” transgressions of Ottawa’s sovereignty.","Venessa Llyod, interim director of CSIS, appeared before Foreign Interference Commission in Sept. “Pakistan’s engagement is consistently in balance with trying to reduce the influence of India...

Harris has big lead over Trump in poll of South Asian voters in US battleground states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harris-has-big-lead-over-trump-in-poll-of-south-asian-voters-in-us-battleground-states/articleshow/114297242.cms,"Kamala Harris, Donald Trump

In a first of its kind poll of South Asian voters in the key battleground states of America, which will play an important role in deciding the winner in the Presidential election next month; US Vice-President Kamala Harris is seen to have a commanding lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump . The survey was commissioned by the Indian American Impact Fund , a political organisation representing Indian and South Asian American communities, and conducted by public opinion research and political strategy firm GBAO , among 600 South Asian likely general election voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania last month.It included a large percentage of Indian Americans.The South Asian electorate, which could be the deciding factor in the swing states, is highly motivated to support Harris, who they see as aligned with their top priorities in this election, the survey found. “The results of this first-of-its-kind South Asian battleground poll demonstrated that Harris is more popular among our communities and leads Trump by a significant margin. The South Asian population in the battleground states is large and voters are likely to be the deciding factor in who wins the Presidential election next month. Members of our community trust Vice-President Harris and are energised by her,” Chintan Patel, executive director Indian American Impact Fund, told the Times of India.He added that while Indian Americans felt a deep sense of pride about being represented at the highest office in America by a woman of Indian heritage, who looks like them; they also support Harris on various policy issues.Besides Harris leading Trump by a wide 48-point margin among South Asian battleground voters, other key findings of the survey included Harris voters holding a motivation advantage over Trump supporters and inflation, the economy and abortion being top of mind issues for South Asians in the US Presidential election.South Asian voters, who were surveyed, overwhelmingly supported abortion. The survey found that Harris is trusted more than Trump on a wide range of issues including the economy, taxes, and crime, signalling a confidence in Harris’ approach and policies.Indian American Impact is now continuing with its targeted outreach to the South Asian community following the survey, in the last weeks before the Presidential election. “It will be crucial for Harris to secure battleground states and make history as the first South Asian American president. We are ramping up our efforts in the next weeks to campaign among the 400,000 plus eligible South Asian voters in key states. Our community can swing this election,” Patel said. The organisation is working to mobilise resources with door-to-door campaigns, phone and text banking. “Some of the Indian American elected officials have also joined us for events to help galvanise and motivate voters from the community on the ground,” Patel added.The Impact Fund has also tied up with Future Forward (FF PAC), a US Presidential Super Political Action Committee, to launch a $3.5 million advertising campaign to reach South Asian and Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in support of Harris. This represents the largest independent expenditure programme ever focused on AAPI voters for a presidential candidate, according to Impact Fund.The campaign will spotlight key priorities important to South Asian communities, such as the economy, abortion rights, and supporting caregivers, while also highlighting how Harris’s South Asian heritage and background inform those values. The ads will be featured across multiple platforms, including TV, digital and radio channels to reach 1.3 million eligible AAPI voters, including 400,000 South Asian voters, in the critical battleground states.""We are witnessing an unprecedented moment for South Asian and Asian Americans in US politics,” Patel said. “This partnership with Future Forward represents a historic investment in ensuring South Asian and AAPI voices are heard at the ballot box, and with Kamala Harris leading the charge, we have a unique opportunity to make history.”","US Vice-President Kamala Harris is seen to have a commanding lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump.

Javid Ahmad Dar (Rafiabad in Baramulla) completes the line-up.That the two Hindu faces in Omar's cabinet — ex-BJP member Choudhary and Congress 'rebel' Sharma — are both political turncoats isn't the only coincidence. Choudhary defeated J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina in the election, while Sharma relegated Congress's working president and ex-deputy CM Tara Chand to third in the vote stakes.Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, and NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah were in attendance at the heavily-guarded Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre on the banks of the Dal as lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha presided over the ceremony marking the formal end of six years of central rule.The presence of Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid, who defeated Omar in the Lok Sabha battle this year while still in Tihar jail in a terror case, accentuated the significance of the occasion.""I fulfilled my promise by choosing a deputy CM from Jammu. I had promised the people of Jammu that they wouldn't feel they are not part of the govt,"" Omar said in his first remarks after the swearing-in.The CM said at least three more berths in the govt would be filled soon, also indicating talks were underway with ally Congress regarding its decision to sit out the formation of the cabinet.Amid speculation of Congress functionaries being divided over the choice of a potential inclusion in the cabinet, PCC chief Tariq Hameed Karra said the party was only iterating its commitment to getting J&K's statehood restored by supporting the govt from outside till then. Congress has six MLAs in the 95-member House, with its tally halving compared to the last election in 2014.Sources said Karra, elected from Shalteng in Srinagar, was to get a cabinet berth, but several senior functionaries wanted the coalition brass to pick AICC general secretary G A Mir, who won the Dooru seat in Anantnag, ahead of the former.“Congratulations to CM Omar Abdullah and to the people of J&K. However, government formation without statehood felt incomplete today. Democracy was snatched from the people, and today we renew our pledge to continue our fight until statehood is fully restored,” Rahul wrote on X.Omar is expected to convene the first cabinet meeting Thursday and get a resolution passed to propose restoration of J&K's statehood and submit it to PM Narendra Modi.","Congress opts out of joining Union territory J&K's first elected govt ""till statehood is restored"" Surinder Kumar Choudhary of Jammu's Nowshera made the cut as CM Omar Abdullah's deputy in the six-member INDIA bloc ministry that took the oath of office.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114297276,imgsize-1390092,width-400,resizemode-4/114297276.jpg"

Congress may pledge Karnataka-like '5 guarantees' in Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-may-pledge-karnataka-like-5-guarantees-in-maharashtra/articleshow/114295689.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress is seriously weighing the ""five guarantees"" of Karnataka as the populist promises for the Maharashtra electorate.An additional feature in the Maharashtra polls will be the promise of "" caste census "", to woo communities across the caste divide and to assure the electorate that the Congress approach seeks to address the multiple quota rows raging in the state without disturbing the existing share of any community.The populist promises being considered for Maharashtra revolve around monthly cash payments to the women heads of households, free bus travel for women, free 10 kg food grains for families, free power up to 200 units, unemployment allowance.Well-placed sources said the Congress brass is actively discussing the Karnataka guarantees for the Maharashtra manifesto, though there may be some tweaks. The populist approach seeks to build on the party's success in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections when Congress, as part of the three-way MVA alliance comprising Sharad Pawar's NCP and Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena, swept 31 of the 48 seats.What seems to have added urgency to the party's populist approach is the sops the BJP-backed Eknath Shinde govt has unveiled after its dismal LS show, like the launch of the ""Ladki-Bahin Yojana"" entitling women between 21-65 years to a monthly payment of Rs 1,500. Congress is likely to promise an increase in the cash amount paid under the scheme.The party first adopted the ""guarantee-based approach"" in the 2022 Himachal polls, which also marked its first victory since December 2018 when it swept Chhattisgarh, MP and Rajasthan. Then, it announced ""five guarantees"" for Karnataka polls, where it registered a big win over BJP in May 2023. Later, Congress made similar promises in the winning cause of Telangana in December 2023.","Congress is seriously weighing the ""five guarantees"" of Karnataka as the populist promises for the Maharashtra electorate.
