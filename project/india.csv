He said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 is not meant to take away anyone's citizenship, but is a law for granting Indian citizenship to people displaced from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on religious grounds.""The Congress, Trinamool Congress or the Left parties make promises during elections that are not fulfilled, but the BJP delivers on its promises,"" he said, addressing a rally here in support of BJP candidate from Malda Uttar constituency, Khagen Murmu.He asserted that no one can stop the implementation of CAA in West Bengal, along with the rest of India."" Mamata didi says she will not allow CAA in her state. Why is she trying to hoodwink the people of West Bengal,"" Singh said.The Centre had in March implemented the CAA, notifying the rules four years after the law was passed by Parliament to fast-track citizenship for undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who came to India before December 31, 2014.Singh said that India is treated with respect under the Narendra Modi-led government, unlike under previous dispensations.""When we say something in an international forum, it is listened to with respect,"" he said, adding that Modi's pledge is to turn India into a developed country by 2047.Singh said promises like abolishing Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and constructing the Ram Temple in Ayodhya have been fulfilled, and that there are indications of the coming into being of a 'Ram Rajya'.The defence minister said the BJP government at the Centre has also delivered on its promise of abolishing 'triple talaq'.""We can not only bring to book terrorists inside our territory, but if anyone tries to attack our unity and pride from outside, we can dare to go beyond our borders to teach them a lesson; this is our strength,"" Singh said.Slamming the TMC, he alleged that only extortionists, criminals and the corrupt have flourished in Bengal after the party came to power.The senior BJP leader also accused the state government of denying people benefits of central welfare projects.","Defence Minister Rajnath Singh says no one can stop implementation of CAA in West Bengal.

Democracy will end if 'Modi-Shah sarkar' returns to power: Kharge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/democracy-will-end-if-modi-shah-sarkar-returns-to-power-kharge/articleshow/109478029.cms,"SATNA: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday claimed that democracy will end in the country if the "" Modi-Shah sarkar "" returns to power, launching an attack on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah while addressing a public meeting in Madhya Pradesh's Satna district, Kharge said they will also scrap the Constitution.""They will scrap the Constitution scripted by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. If you want to keep it alive, the right to vote for women, labourers and farmers, then vote for the Congress and its 'panja' (hand) symbol,"" he appealed to the voters.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was scheduled to address the rally in Satna but his visit was cancelled as he took ill, a party leader said earlier, adding that Kharge would fill in for him.The Satna Lok Sabha seat will go to polls in the second phase on April 26.""Democracy will end if Modi-Shah's government returns to power,"" Kharge claimed addressing the public meeting held in support of Congress candidate Siddharth Kushwaha.Accusing PM Modi of telling lies, Kharge said the PM keeps talking about ""Modi ki guarantee"" without taking his party's name. ""He had said that if he became the prime minister, Rs 15 lakh would be given to every person by bringing back the black money stashed abroad. Did you get it,"" he asked.Modi had also told the young people of this country that 2 crore jobs would be generated every year, said Kharge continuing his criticism of the PM.""Now 10 years have gone. Did you all get 20 crore jobs... Ask the BJP about their 20 crore jobs (promise). Ask them where is Rs 15 lakh when they come seeking your votes,"" the senior Congress leader said.Kharge said Modi had promised to double farmers' income but that too has not happened.Listing out the prices of cooking gas cylinders, milk, flour and pulses when the Congress-led UPA was in power before 2014, Kharge said rates of these commodities have skyrocketed in the past ten years.""These are Modi's acche din (good days). This man always says I will bring acche din. He tells so many lies. That's why I call him 'jhoothon ka sardar',"" Kharge said.The country's unemployment rate is the highest in the past 45 years but there is no account of it, he said.Kharge also claimed that the country's assets like airports, roads, land, public sector undertakings and big factories are being sold to ""two buyers"".""Who are these two men? Adani and Ambani are buyers. Who are the sellers? Modi and Shah,"" Kharge said.Loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore of rich people have been waived but the loans of poor farmers are yet to be written off, he said. Farm loans of Rs 72,000 crore were waived under the leadership of former prime minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.Kharge also slammed PM Modi and Union minister Shah for taking those into the BJP fold who were ""corrupt"" till they were in other parties.It seems Shah has a ""big laundry with a washing machine to wash those who are corrupt"" before inducting them into the BJP, the Congress leader claimed.Besides Satna, Rewa, Tikamgarh, Khajuraho, Damoh and Hoshangabad seats will vote in the second phase of the Lok Sabha polls on April 26.","Mallikarjun Kharge claims democracy will end in the country if the "" Modi-Shah sarkar "" returns to power.

Doordarshan's 'saffron' logo sparks political slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doordarshans-saffron-logo-sparks-political-slugfest/articleshow/109465416.cms,"NEW DELHI: The visual makeover for Doordarshan 's news channels marked by a change in the colour of its logo from red to orange has sparked a controversy , with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister locking horns over what the opposition called an attempt to ""saffronise"" the national broadcaster.Mamata slammed the move calling it ""absolutely unethical, grossly illegal, and speaks loudly of the pro-BJP bias of the national public broadcaster"" and demanded Election Commission's intervention.I&B minister Anurag Thakur, however, shrugged off the charge and suggested that Mamata's stand was in keeping with her resistance to ""anything saffron "".Prasar Bharti CEO Gaurav Dwivedi also pushed against the charge saying, ""No surprises there, your love for 'saffron' is publicly known :) Didi, Bharat Mata ki Jai."" He argued that the move was meant for visual enhancement and the colour that has raised hackles is, in fact, orange and not saffron as being alleged.Congress MP and former I&B minister Manish Tewari criticised the switch saying it was a move to assert BJP govt's control over the public broadcaster. ""This is an attempt on the part of the govt to saffronise and capture the govt institutions. The said move clearly undermines the neutrality and credibility of India's public broadcaster,"" he wrote on X.TMC MP Jawahar Sircar, who served as CEO of Prasar Bharati, also criticised the alleged saffronisation of the national broadcaster saying, ""As ex-CEO of Prasar Bharati it hurts to see the saffronisation of Doordarshan's logo - just before elections! It will influence voters, by overlaying the colour one religion and Sangh Parivar colour with a 'neutral' Public Broadcaster and a biassed Govt/Regime.""Dwivedi, however, argued that the adoption of a vibrant, visually appealing colour was part of the channel's branding and aesthetic upgrade. ""The colour is orange, not saffron,"" he clarified, further explaining, ""It's not just the logo that underwent change, the entire visual identity has been revamped. It's regrettable that people are reading more into this than necessary. We've been working on revitalising DD's look and feel for the past six to eight months.""Established on Sept 15, 1959, the national broadcaster had its logo designed by Devashish Bhattacharya, a student of the National Institute of Design.Contrary to political speculations, the broadcaster clarified that the colour change is rooted in the logo's history and aesthetic appeal. It pointed out that the original logo, chosen by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and introduced in 1976 along with theme music composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan, featured an orange hue against a green backdrop.The vice-president of Andhra BJP, Vishnu Vardhan Reddy attacked the critics saying, ""When #Doordarshan was launched in 1959, it had a saffron logo. Now, as the govt reintroduces the original logo, liberals and #Congress are outraging over it. It's blatantly obvious they harbour hate against 'Bhagwa' and Hindus.""","Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister Anurag Thakur lock horns over colour of Doordarshan's logo.

INDIA alliance tries to convince TMC for joint manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-alliance-tries-to-convince-tmc-for-joint-manifesto/articleshow/109465647.cms,"TMC objects to caste census in manifesto

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc to convey a sense of purpose and unity going forward in the Lok Sabha elections .Well-placed sources said efforts are on to bring TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee around by impressing upon her the urgency to put out a minimal consensus document laying out the promises of the opposition to the voters as her opposition is proving to be the main stumbling block to its release.Sources said TMC has objected to the inclusion of “caste census” in the joint document, which is in line with its earlier red flag to the flagship policy measure on social justice. However, TMC had in the past come around when the INDIA grouping in one of its meetings succeeded in putting “caste census” in its agenda document, and then also repeated it in the public rallies.For the TMC to again raise an objection to the promise that if voted to power, the opposition will hold a nationwide headcount to determine the population of OBCs as well as other communities, appears to have raised doubts in key opposition quarters behind the intention of the Bengal outfit. Sources said the TMC appears more keen to stall the joint document, and is only using “caste census” as a pretext. Meanwhile, Mamata again on Saturday accused Congress and CPM for being hand in glove with BJP in West Bengal, and said “I had coined the name INDIA, but INDIA doesn’t exist in Bengal, it exists outside the state”.Sources said there is no point in releasing a document without “caste census” because it is a key plank of the Congress manifesto, and there is an unanimity on it in the coalition barring the TMC. Else, the option is to unveil the manifesto without the TMC’s support.The joint document is also likely to have a few key flagship promises made by Congress in its manifesto, on which there is practically an agreement with other constituents of the India bloc ."," Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc.

Modi’s BJP practicing discrimination against South India: Telangana CM Revanth Reddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modis-bjp-practicing-discrimination-against-south-india-telangana-cm-revanth-reddy/articleshow/109475688.cms,"BENGALURU: Building on the rhetoric of “injustice to South India”, Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy on Sunday said prime minister Narendra Modi’s government was practicing discrimination against south India which will ensure their downfall.In a freewheeling chat with select media houses, chief minister Revanth Reddy alleged that if any multinational company (MNC) comes to invest in south India, they are “threatened” and asked to shift to Gujarat or other north Indian states.“If any MNC comes to south India, they are directly threatened by the PMO office and asked to shift to Gujarat or other north India states. Their intention is that we (south Indian states) fight for the spillovers,” he claimed.He also gave examples of how the central government had denied all the important portfolios in the central government over the last 10 years.“What we are seeing over the last 10 years is that a majority of the key portfolios in the center, the President and Vice-President apart from other major constitutional posts in the country are being handed to the Hindi belt and North India representatives. Have you ever seen in this country where for the entirety of Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh which has 70 seats only two cabinet ministerial posts have been given?” He said, claiming there was an unwritten rule under Congress that if a north Indian becomes PM, the President or Vice-President would be from South India.“The Congress always managed the regional balance. If they took four from north India, three would be inducted from south,” he claimed.The Telangana CM alleged this discrimination was bound to continue with absolute power in the BJP hands, with those speaking truth to power being forcibly retired.“This struggle between the Aryan and Dravidian cultures is going to become more prominent as the BJP has been neglecting South India. This is going to translate into a rather poor outing for the party,” he said.Reddy predicted that Modi’s BJP will not cross 220 seats.“In the 131 seats of five states-- Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh along with Lakshadweep-- the BJP will not get more than 20 seats,” he said.Reddy added that the BJP is contesting only on 300 of the remaining 412 seats in rest of India with the other 100 odd being fought by its allies.“This suggests that arithmetically and success ratio wise, even if they have 70 per cent winning chance it will reduce it to only 200. The 2019 elections cannot be repeated as they had swept North India then,” he said, adding that Modiji ka Warranty ho gaya hai (Modi’s guarantees have already lost their warranty).He predicted the BJP’s own MP or legislators are undercutting each other and it will happen across the country to reduce their own numbers.“Now, nobody wants Modi within their own party. All those stalwarts who were shunted out from becoming chief ministers in northern states are all working towards this. If someone thinks that they are bigger than the system then nature will correct it, nature prevails,” he said.Going to polls in the fourth phase of the Lok Sabha elections, Telangana is poised at a crucial juncture where the recently elected Congress party is pinning its hopes to win a maximum number of the seats of the 17 segments that is up for grabs in that state.Reddy said the Congress has targeted to win at least 14 of the 17 seats in the state.On the All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) impact, Reddy dismissed it by suggesting the Asaduddin Owaisi party was contesting only on 1 seat and that it had a tacit understanding with the BJP.“While the BJP is consolidating the Muslim votes in Owaisi’s favor with a hardcore Hindu face, the anti-Hindu rhetoric by the AIMIM is consolidating the Hindus for the saffron party. It is clear that Owaisi will consolidate 80 percent of Hindu votes across the country,” he said.",Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy said prime minister Narendra Modi’s government was practicing discrimination against south India. He also gave examples of how the central government had denied all the important portfolios in central government over the last 10 years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109475684,imgsize-31104,width-400,resizemode-4/109475684.jpg"

Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19. Following a fake video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan endorsing a political party made rounds on the internet, a digitally manipulated clip of actor Ranveer Singh is being shared online.In the video, the actor is shown criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the centre, at the same time seeking votes for Congress.The video ends with Singh urging voters to vote for “nyaay” and the tagline 'Vote For Congress ' is seen flashing on the screen.It doesn’t take a second look to identify that the video is doctored. The lip movements of the actor in the video clearly doesn't match the audio. Notably, it is an old video shot when the actor visited Kashi, and in fact praised PM Modi for changing the face of the 'City of Ghats'.In the original video, Singh says, “I cannot express in words the experience that I have had today. I have been a devotee of lord Shiva and I have come here for the first time…” Here’s the original video:Recently, Aamir Khan filed an FIR against a deepfake video that showed him endorsing a specific political party. The actor’s office strongly denied any connection to politics or affiliation with any political party and issued a statement.“We want to clarify [that] Aamir Khan has never endorsed any political party in his 35-year career. He has dedicated his efforts to raising public awareness through campaigns for the Election Commission for many past elections,” the actor’s office said in the statement, as per news agency ANI.“We are alarmed now to see a recent viral video alleging Mr Khan is promoting a particular party. He would like to clarify [that] this is a fake and totally untrue video. He has reported the matter to various authorities, including filing an FIR with the Cyber Crime Cell of Mumbai Police,” the statement added.A video appears to be from his TV show “Satyamev Jayate,” that aired almost a decade ago.","Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19.
