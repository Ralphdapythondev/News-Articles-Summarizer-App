Why trial judges should not just ‘play it safe’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-trial-judges-should-not-just-play-it-safe/articleshow/112274371.cms,"Arbitrary Arrests,

Bail Denial

Preventive Arrests Exceed Prosecutions

Delays In Securing Bail

Need To Question Assumptions

The author is Team Lead, Crime & Punishment, at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy

On July 28, the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, speaking at a conference in Bengaluru, said: “Trial judges are increasingly playing it safe, not granting bail on important issues of serious crimes.” He emphasised that judges should be more receptive to the need for accommodating the concerns of people seeking liberty. He also highlighted that delays in granting bail “compound the problem of those facing arbitrary arrests”.These statements underscore two pressing issues within the criminal justice system : arbitrary arrests and the frequent denial of bail — both of which are affronts to personal liberty .The CJI’s concerns are well-founded. The police exercise unbridled power to arrest anyone on suspicion or apprehension of an offence. The courts, meant to check this power, are often too reluctant to grant bail. Laws, especially special legislations, further erode the fundamental principle of ‘bail, not jail’ by imposing unreasonably harsh conditions for bail, often requiring judges to make a preliminary assessment of guilt.On July 29, a day after the CJI’s comments, an SUV driver was arrested for driving through a waterlogged road near a coaching institute in Delhi where three people drowned due to waterlogging. He was charged with culpable homicide and initially denied bail, only to be released after spending four days in custody.Then, on July 30, Uttar Pradesh assembly passed an amendment to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversions Act, 2021, imposing stringent bail conditions similar to those in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. These laws require judges to conclude that reasonable grounds exist to show the accused is not guilty of the offence before they grant bail. Anecdotes, however, do not present the complete picture of the problem that confronts us.'Latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau show that 32 lakh people were arrested for offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, in 2022, and another 21.6 lakh for offences under special laws. In comparison, over 80 lakh people were preventively arrested under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973, and other state-specific provisions. This is 50% more than arrests for crimes that were actually committed. While around 80% of these individuals were released within 24 hours, many remained in police or judicial custody for extended periods. What is crucial to note is that courts do not get to test the necessity and validity of the majority of these arrests, fostering a culture of arbitrary detentions that escape judicial scrutiny.Data from prisons in India also show how arrests, pretrial, and undertrial detention impact the right to personal liberty. At the end of 2022, there were 4.3 lakh undertrials in Indian prisons, accounting for 76% of the total prison population. During the same year, 15 lakh undertrials were released from prison, with 95% of them released on bail. This may suggest that the bail system is functioning adequately.However, the details reveal a deeper issue: at the end of 2022, around 68% of undertrials in Indian prisons had been in custody for at least three months. Of these, 11,448 had spent over five years in prison as undertrials. This extended pretrial and undertrial detention reflects a systemic failure that contradicts the very essence of personal liberty. Even as the trial courts’ reluctance to grant bail proactively is concerning, delays in high courts exacerbate the problem. Almost 40% of bail matters in high courts take over a month for disposal, with median disposal times ranging from 28 days to 156 days for many high courts (Daksh, 2023). These delays further undermine the efficacy of the bail system and contribute to prolonged and unjust detentions.Even as arbitrary arrests and delays in the disposal of bail applications contribute to a burgeoning crisis of overcrowded prisons and a broader issue of personal liberty, the laws add to the problem by categorising more offences as cognisable, providing wide powers of arrest, and imposing stringent conditions for granting bail.So, is there a solution? The legislature can ensure that criminal laws and procedures do not overly rely on jail terms and police powers of arrest are restricted to absolutely necessary situations. The judiciary can adopt a more proactive approach to protect personal liberty and avoid normalising pretrial and undertrial detention.The police can be sensitised to the fact that personal liberty is the most cherished of fundamental rights and should not be routinely trampled upon. Also, there’s a need to question the premise that police remand is a prerequisite for any investigation, and that judicial custody is necessary to ensure trial.","Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said judges should be more receptive to the need for accommodating the concerns of people seeking liberty. The police exercise unbridled power to arrest anyone on suspicion or apprehension of an offence. The courts, meant to check this power, are often too reluctant to grant bail.

Natural diamond hub eyes lion's share in lab gems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/natural-diamond-hub-eyes-lions-share-in-lab-gems/articleshow/112273927.cms,"SURAT: India, the undisputed natural diamonds processing behemoth, is sniffing a chance of establishing itself as the world's largest lab-grown diamonds (LGD) maker and exporter.The massive fall in LGD prices over the last year has forced some of the leading global firms making these synthetic gems to reconsider their positions. The relatively young Indian LGD firms have been quick to capitalize on the situation by offering their products at highly competitive prices.The average per carat price of LGD plummeted to around $179 in 2023-24 from $355 in 2022-23. Unable to sustain such a sharp fall, several international firms like WD LGD, the largest LGD maker in the US, filed for bankruptcy last year.Similarly, international natural diamond behemoth De Beers suspended its LGD production for jewellery in May. The latest to join the shop shutters is Diam Concept, a French man-made diamonds firm, which went into receivership in July.Local firms have the inherent advantage of lower costs of growing, cutting-polishing, jewellery manufacturing, and a global marketing network. In 2022-23, India's LGD exports were 4.73 million carats, worth $1,680.29 million. In 2023-24, the export of LGD was 7.81 million carats, but fell in value terms to $1,402.44 million.Industry insiders say that rising LGD production in India has been pulling down prices for the last few years, while firms operating in foreign countries prefer to exit due to plummeting profits.These firms made huge profits when LGD prices were higher and in short supply. ""But with dropping profits, it proves difficult for them to meet the expenses in their region of operation. In India, the production costs are much lower; hence we can manage with lower profits as well,"" Dinesh Navadiya, chairman of Indian Diamond Institute, says. Industry sources said there could be other financial and business reasons behind developments in these firms, but stiff global LGD competition cannot be ruled out.Vallabh Lakhani, a leading LGD manufacturer, said: ""It's true that Indian firms are giving tough competition globally. While some foreign firms are still in the race with better technology, India too has close competition from China in smaller diamonds, and it may toughen if they succeed in manufacturing big (more than one carat) diamonds."" Vipul Shah, chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), said: ""While some international players have scaled back or exited the market, it's essential to consider the broader context. India's emergence as a global LGD manufacturing hub has been phenomenal. Our country's diamond expertise, strong infrastructure, skilled workforce, and cost-effective operations have positioned us as a preferred destination for LGD production."" ""Indian LGD industry can give tough competition since we grow our diamonds, we already have the world's best cutting and polishing infrastructure, and we are also doing well in jewellery manufacturing. We already have a marketing network to sell our products globally,"" Babu Vaghani, president of LGD Association, said. Rajni Chanchad, another LGD maker, says: ""We have a better level-playing field for jewellery manufacturing.""","The average per carat price of LGD plummeted to around $179 in 2023-24 from $355 in 2022-23.

When the astronaut experiences the flight, we can learn from how they conduct the mission and how the spacecraft docks with the ISS. Working with an international crew already stationed there will provide us with valuable knowledge. The prime astronaut on this mission will also receive training on how to conduct the mission,” the Isro chief added.Nasa will be launching IAF Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla as India’s Gaganyatri to the ISS. Welcoming the move, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson posted on X: “Congratulations, ISRO. We look forward to welcoming the first ISRO astronaut to the International Space Station! This is a monumental step forward for the US-India partnership in space.”“The experiences gained during this mission will be beneficial for the Indian Human Space Programme and will also strengthen human spaceflight cooperation between ISRO and Nasa,” the Indian space agency stated.Meanwhile, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s family in Lucknow is elated after hearing about his selection for the ISS trip . His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, a retired govt officer, said the family is not nervous about the expedition but filled with pride. His mother, Asha Shukla, described Shubhanshu, their youngest child, as “cool-minded” and someone who handles every situation calmly.“Initially, I was resistant to his joining the armed forces and hoped he would pursue a civil service career. But when he was selected [for the armed forces], I didn’t object. When we received the news [of his selection for the ISS mission], nothing could match that moment.

Government set to bring bill to curb waqf board powers on assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-bring-bill-to-curb-waqf-board-powers-on-assets/articleshow/112253430.cms,"Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards

NEW DELHI: In a major step, government wants to curb the ""unfettered"" powers of Waqf Boards to declare any property a 'waqf asset' and take control of it.Sources said the Cabinet on Friday evening discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013), including ones to check the jurisdiction, considered arbitrary in many quarters, of Waqf Boards which now control assets running into lakhs of crores of rupees across the country.Under the proposed amendments, Waqf Boards' claims, which were previously unrestricted, will be subject to mandatory verification. A similar mechanism of mandatory verification has been proposed also for properties for which Waqf Boards and individual owners have made claims and counter-claims.Though an official briefing on Friday evening on Cabinet decisions did not mention this move, sources indicated that a Bill to amend the Wakf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week.Sources also said that the two provisions of mandatory verification of properties, which would check arbitrary powers of Waqf Boards, are the major amendments proposed to the Act. At present, these entities have powers to tag any property as waqf asset. More than 8.7 lakh properties across the country, totalling around 9.4 lakh acres, are under the jurisdiction of Waqf Boards.The need for such legislation arose as there were several representations from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Shia and Bohras, among others, seeking changes in the existing law, sources said, underlining that the preparation to bring amendments had started much before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. They also added that preliminary perusal of the laws across Islamic nations such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and others show that none of these countries have given such sweeping powers to one entity.More sweeping powers were conferred on Waqf Boards by bringing amendments to the original Act during the UPA govt in 2013, which have been a major bone of contention among waqf authorities, individual property owners, and several state entities, including the Archaeological Survey of India.TOI has learned that the Bill also proposes changes in the composition of Waqf Boards and also seeks to repeal some provisions of the current law.The Wakf Act, 1995 was enacted to regulate ‘auqaf’ (assets donated and notified as waqf) by a wakif — the person who dedicates a property for any purpose recognised by the Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable.Earlier, govt had taken note of sweeping powers of state Waqf Boards to stake claim on any property and also delay in conducting a survey of such property in most states. Government had also considered the possibility of involving district magistrates in monitoring of waqf properties to prevent misuse of the assets. Sources said the flaws in the appeal process were also under scrutiny.","Cabinet discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013) Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards.

'We are in Paris to give India its 9th Olympic hockey gold': Captain Harmanpreet promises the nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/we-are-in-paris-to-give-india-its-9th-olympic-hockey-gold-captain-harmanpreet-promises-the-nation/articleshow/112237660.cms,"Every time adrenaline gushes through Harmanpreet's forearms to send those drag-flicks whizzing past defenders and bring the opponent post crashing down in Paris, mind goes back to the January evening of 2023 in Bhubaneswar. A dejected India skipper, carrying the nation's hopes on his penalty-corner skills, appeared clueless. The ball almost refused to roll up his stick on those flicks.The New Zealanders sent India out of the World Cup.It was not even the quarterfinal. Dream dusted in the crossovers, a desperate D-top flick by Harmanpreet during one-on-one shootout against the Kiwi custodian defined the tournament for India and its skipper.Head hung in disappointment, Harmanpreet dragged himself to the mandatory press conference along with Graham Reid, who almost knew it was his last meeting with the media as the India coach.It was about a year and half to go for the Paris Olympics then. Hockey India brought in a new coach in Craig Fulton, and his partnership with Harmanpreet as the team's think-tank has not just won India titles, including the Asian Games gold, but also saw Harmanpreet returning with his lethal short-corner skills that have taken India to the quarterfinals of theParis Games .With six goals in five matches, Harmanpreet is playing like Rocky Balboa returning to the ring.India's two slightly nervous opening matches were salvaged by Harmanpreet's last-minute goals, resulting in a 3-2 win over New Zealand and a 1-1 draw against the 2016 Olympic champions Argentina. The clean sheet in the 2-0 win over Ireland, courtesy Harmanpreet's brace, was comforting. But the real test at the pool stage was always going to be defending Olympic champions Belgium and nemesis Australia.With a place in the quarterfinals sealed before the two big games, India gave the Belgians a run for their money before losing 1-2. But the story of the men's hockey competition so far was written in the match against Australia.After 52 years, India finally managed to bell the cat and beat the Aussies in an Olympic match -- the last instance being a 3-1 win at the Munich Games in 1972.Harmanpreet's stick continued to fire, scoring two goals in India's 3-2 win, taking the tally of his international goals to 190 in 224 matches.Opposite to the trend against the Aussies over the years, it was India who led 2-1 at half-time, showing the promise that the team wants to deliver on in Paris.“That's what we are looking for -- to give India its ninth (hockey) gold. We are giving (it our) everything to win that gold medal,"" Harmanpreet told FIH (International Hockey Federation) after the win over Australia.""But the main tournament is starting now. So the quarterfinals, the semifinals, those matches are very crucial. So we're just looking to give our best,” said the two-time FIH Men’s Player of the Year.Having finished second in Pool B with 10 points, India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain. The match is scheduled for 1:30 pm IST on August 4.Decoding the historic win over Australia, Harmanpreet said: ""We started (the Paris Olympics by) winning, and we decided we were going to finish with a winning match. We put them under pressure and the pressure was so good from the frontline. And our motto was to score the first goal. So we did it and I think after that we managed very well. Because everybody knows that the Australians come full press, so the positioning and scanning was good today, the way we managed the ball.""The real tournament, though, begins with the knockouts, where the losing team packs its bags to go home. And Harmanpreet summed it up in few and precise words.""There's no room to make mistakes.""","Harmanpreet scored two goals in India's 3-2 win over Australia.

Here's the complete list-Independence Day commemorates India's liberation from British colonial rule in 1947. It's a national holiday marked by patriotic fervor, parades, and celebrations, honoring the sacrifices of freedom fighters.Raksha Bandhan is a cherished festival celebrating the unbreakable bond between siblings. Sisters tie a sacred thread (rakhi) on their brother's wrist, symbolizing protection and love. In return, brothers pledge to protect their sisters.Janmashtami is a joyous occasion dedicated to the birth of Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Devotees observe fasts, decorate homes, and participate in midnight prayers and celebrations. It's a time for spiritual reflection and devotion.In addition to the scheduled holidays in August, there are several important observances, such as awareness days, the birth anniversaries of prominent figures, and other significant events.

KOCHI: At 1:30 am on Tuesday, Neethu Jojo made the first phone call that let the world know of the tragedy that was about to unfold in Wayanad .As a resident of Chooralmala and recognising the telltale signs of a devastation unfolding - the roar of the wind, the thunder of rocks tumbling down and the gushing water that entered her home - Neethu lost no time in calling up Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences ( WIMS ) where she worked as an executive.""She called me up around 1:30 am. She told me that there was a massive landslide in her area, and the area was being inundated. She asked me to send a vehicle to rescue them,"" Shanavas Palliyal, deputy general manager at WIMS, told TOI.Palliyal pacified Neethu, telling her that help was on the way and then got around to arranging it.It is around 40-45 minutes’ drive from our hospital. So, I asked her to wait for some time. Then, I called the police station in Meppadi but the line was busy. Then I tried the number at Kalpetta station, but the cops there were unaware of the landslide. Then I dialled 100 and got to the control room at Thiruvananthapuram and shared the news,” Palliyal said.An ambulancewas rushed to Neethu’s house at Chooralmala from the medical college. But the bridge beyond Chooralmala town was blocked by an uprooted tree and the ambulance was stalled. By the time a smaller ambulance — an Omni van — was found and sent to the place, it was too late.Inside Neethu’s house, the situation was dire with the water rising by the minute. She urged her husband Jojo to take their five-year-old son and her parents to leave the place and seek higher ground. As a member of the healthcare industry, Neethu’s caregiver instincts had kicked in. She told her husband that she would follow them soon, once she had gathered the few neighbours who were moving in the direction of her house. Her Samaritan nature was to cost her life. Around 4am, the second more devastating landslide occurred.Palliyal said that he called her again at this point but all he could hear was Neethu’s panicked voice and that of her neighbours. “The river started to widen and change its course in the area where her house was located. She along with others was washed away,” he said.Neethu’s body was retrieved from Soochimala waterfalls. But initially, there was some confusion which delayed things. “It was her bangle which became the key for her husband Jojo to make sure it was Neethu’s body,” Palliyal said.","Neethu Jojo, an executive at Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences, lost her life in a landslide.

Land jihad big threat to demography: Himanta

GUWAHATI: BJP-governed Assam is ready with a proposed law mandating life imprisonment for anyone convicted of "" love jihad "", CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said Sunday, less than a week after the UP assembly passed a Bill amending the state's 2021 anti-conversion legislation to increase the punishment for offences linked to marriage or elopement from the current maximum 10-year jail term to life.A law requiring prior chief ministerial consent for land-related transactions between Hindus and Muslims is also in the works to halt what Sarma labelled "" land jihad "".""We spoke about love jihad during the elections. It is a real and serious issue, involving forced conversions and deceitful romantic relationships. In the next few days, we aim to take steps to make this punishable with a life sentence,"" the CM saidIf a Muslim wants to buy a Hindu’s property or a Hindu wants to buy a Muslim’s property, it will be subject to scrutiny, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at BJP ’s state executive meeting in Guwahati.Besides Uttar Pradesh in 2021, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have enacted anti-conversion laws with separate and stricter clauses against change in religion deemed to linked to “love jihad”.In Assam, BJP-led govt last month moved to repeal Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Act and Rules of 1935, which permitted underage marriages under specific conditions.CM Sarma mentioned at the BJP meeting that his govt viewed “land jihad” as a serious threat to the state’s demography and had al-ready reclaimed encroached areas through a series of eviction campaigns.He said a span equivalent to the size of Chandigarh had been freed from encroachment by people from a particular community.BJP is committed to protecting every right of the indigenous people of the state, the CM said. “We will have a new law to protect land in historically and culturally important regions like Barpeta, Majuli, and Batadrava so that only the people from those places can purchase property there.”Sarma said the delimitation exercise last year was a crucial step towards safeguarding the state’s future.On CAA, Sarma mentioned the “limited impact” of the agitation against the law. “Bringing CAA was a brave step by BJP govt. We are going to initiate a process to unlock biometrics of people that were blocked,” he said.","A law requiring prior chief ministerial consent for land-related transactions between Hindus and Muslims is also in the works to halt what Sarma labelled "" land jihad "" Uttar Pradesh in 2021, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have enacted anti-conversion laws with separate and stricter clauses against change in religion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112270727,imgsize-827592,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112270727.jpg"

Claiming National Testing Agency to be ""at the very heart of NEET scan-dal"", Congress on Sunday accused it of making a Rs 448-crore profit in last six years by conducting exams and not using the corpus ""to build its capabilities to conduct tests itself or to strengthen regulatory and monitoring capabilities for its vendors"".Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan junked the claim.""Opposition is frustrated with their failed propaganda. However, people need to understand the mandate of exam-conducting organisations like NTA and CBSE , which are self-sustaining.

The organisation has been in the negative since its inception,"" he said.National Testing Agency on Sunday rebutted claims that it had made a profit of Rs 448 crore in the last six years through conduct of exams, which sources in NTA said were “based on inadequate understanding and facts”.Citing data based on the reply to a Parliament question, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said on X, “This corpus, however, has not been used to build the agency's capabilities to conduct tests itself, or to strengthen regulatory and monitoring capabilities for its vendors.”Ramesh shared minister of state for education Sukanta Majumdar's reply in Rajya Sabha on July 31 to a question on NTA. According to the reply, “NTA collected an estimated Rs 3,512.98 crore while it spent Rs 3,064.77 crore on the conduct of examinations, it therefore netted a profit of Rs 448 crore in the last six years”, he said.Dismissing the claim, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, “The opposition is frustrated with their failed propaganda. The govt has initiated comprehensive examination and NTA reforms, and we are awaiting the recommendations of the high-powered committee. However, people need to understand the mandate of exam-conducting organisations like NTA and CBSE, which are self-sustaining. Unlike typical govt entities, self-sustaining bodies like NTA have operational costs. The organisation has been in the negative since its inception.""Ramesh earlier said, “NTA is at the very heart of the NEET scandal . It is a body of the education ministry whose only purpose is to function via outsourcing to private vendors. Not only do these vendors very often have dubious credentials but the NTA itself is headed by a person who presided over the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission, which has seen mega scams,” he added.In response, a senior NTA official said, “Having a corpus of Rs 450 crore to Rs 500 crore in the bank doesn't mean we are in the positive, as they are not considering the liabilities. Apart from the cost of conducting exams, salaries are also paid from the same collection of registration fees.""","National Testing Agency on Sunday rebutted claims that it had made a profit of Rs 448 crore in the last six years through conduct of exams.

Proposed bill seeks to make women waqf board members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/proposed-bill-seeks-to-make-women-waqf-board-members/articleshow/112270799.cms,"NEW DELHI: The proposed amendments to the Waqf Act will include, judicial scrutiny to determine whether a property is a waqf asset and mandatory provision of registration of properties with district collectors for their actual valuation. Another major proposed change will to broad-base the composition of the Central Waqf Council and waqf boards in states by mandating inclusion of two women as members in each of these entities, sources said on Sunday.Government is also considering giving a new name to the law akin to the meaning of ""hope"", sources said. There are 30 waqf boards in the country looking after properties spanning more than 8 lakh acres, which make them the third largest owner of real estate after the ministries of railways and defence.As per the 40 amendments that were cleared by Cabinet on Friday, the entire mechanism for collection of revenue from commercial use of waqf properties and expenditure will be made online, which will bring transparency and benefit the ""poor, children and women"", who hardly get any benefit, sources said. All income from waqf properties are meant to be spent for charity.Rejecting allegations from some sections that govt is trying to take over waqf properties by bringing changes in the law, sources said the proposed amendments will rather ensure the deprived sections get the maximum benefit as there will be proper use of waqf assets for welfare of poor Muslims. They also said while assets will remain with waqf boards, these will be registered properly and there will be proper audits of these entities, stressing that the amendment to allow judicial scrutiny of waqf boards' decisions, are based on the recommendations of the Sachar Committee and K Rahman Khan-led joint parliamentary panel.Sources said govt will establish a framework on how waqf properties should be used so that revenue earned from them are spent for welfare of only poor Muslims.""Despite the waqf boards having more than 8.7 lakh immovable properties, the total revenue is barely Rs 200 crore. These boards are also controlled by only around 200 people. So the need was felt after getting representations from Muslim women and intellectuals to bring the amendments. The instances and numerous allegations of misuse of power by the boards for so many years simply show how urgent it is to amend the law and how we are too late to correct this,"" said a source who did not wish to be named.Though the govt has not yet decided when to introduce the amendment Bill in Parliament, sources did not deny this as well, while mentioning there is little time available in the session to do so.The Waqf Act was first passed by Parliament in 1954. Subsequently, it was repealed and a new Waqf Act was passed in 1995 which gave more powers to waqf boards.In 2013, it was further amended and renamed as Wakf waqf Act to give unlimited powers to the boards to take any property, which even could not be challenged in any court. The Waqf Boards have unlimited powers to claim properties in the name of Muslim charity and even plaintiffs are barred from seeking justice from the judiciary, sources said.Sources said the Union govt gave the land of Muslims who went from India to Pakistan to the Waqf Boards under the Waqf Board Act of 1954. But in 1995, Congress changed the Waqf Board Act to give the boards unlimited rights to acquire land in what was largely seen as an attempt to modify Muslims in the wake of the Babri demolition of 1991.The Congress-led UPA govt again amended the act in 2013.","Proposed amendments to the Waqf Act will include, judicial scrutiny to determine whether a property is a waqf asset and mandatory provision of registration of properties with district collectors for their actual valuation.

VADODARA: Delhi high court has directed a Noida resident and some social media platforms to remove defamatory videos on Amul products. This follows a post by the resident, Deepa Devi, in June claiming she had found a centipede in an Amul vanilla tub purchased from Blinkit, sparking an internet furore.A bench of Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora passed the order recently after lawyers for Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (AmulFed) -- the maker of Amul products and owner of its brand -- told the high court that the Noida resident had failed to appear before the court despite several notices and opportunities.Jayen Mehta, managing director of GCMMF , called it a ""milestone"" verdict. ""This has established that a consumer has no right to recover money by illegal and defamatory posts misusing social media,"" said Mehta.In an interim order last month, the high court had directed Deepa to take down her posts. Later, the court issued another order, stating that the defamatory content should be removed from all social media platforms, including X, YouTube and Meta. Justice Arora issued the order on July 24 after hearing the lawyers for GCMMF and some social media platforms.The high court had ordered that if the video and the post, or parts of them, are found uploaded on the platforms, they shall all have to be deleted.""Amul shall bring the same to the notice of the social media and the concerned URLs shall be taken down by them within 36 hours,"" the order states.The court observed that the URLs of the posts had already been provided to the counsels for X, YouTube, Meta and other platforms. If requests to take down URLs cannot be acceded to, the social media platforms will have to intimate Amul within 48 hours to enable it to seek redress in accordance with the law, the HC's order added.Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation's Mehta explained the significance of the order.""In the history of Amul, this is the first milestone judgment to prevent social media misuse by any consumer,"" Mehta said.","Delhi high court has directed a Noida resident and some social media platforms to remove defamatory videos on Amul products.

Two landslides in as many hours had left Mundakkai and Chooralmala devastated, the caller said.Vijayakumari stepped out within minutes, riding her scooter to Chooralmala in blinding rain. She reached the area around 5am, only to find the neighbourhood she knew reduced to heaps of mud and slush.Vijayakumari immediately offered to join the rescue effort, telling officials that she was a trained civil defence volunteer. By 8pm, she had helped retrieve 17 bodies.""It was an unsettling sight, but one that I couldn't turn my back on,"" she told TOI.Over the next two days, Vijayakumari worked tirelessly in the temporary morgue set up at Meppadi to keep bodies and body parts brought from Nilambur.

ED to return Rs 12 crore scam money to victims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-to-return-rs-12-crore-scam-money-to-victims/articleshow/112271231.cms,"NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate is set to start restituting money to victims of scams. It will start with disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore in attached fixed deposits (FDs) of Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors who were tempted by the accused companies into depositing money with them by by promising exorbitant returns that never materialised.In a first, a special PMLA court in Kolkata on July 24 asked ED to transfer 14 attached FDs valued at Rs 11.99 crore in the Rose Valley scam to a court monitored Asset Disposal Committee (ADC), ""subject to the conditions that amount shall be disbursed to the bona-fide claimants on pro-rata basis or as may be directed by ADC or by the court"".ED started implementing the order, in keeping with PM Narendra Modi's promise during Lok Sabha campaign to compensate victims of financial crimes by distributing among them accused's assets that have been seized by ED.During the campaign, Modi had said that upon being re-elected, he would explore legal options for restituting the victims of frauds by distributing among them the accused's assets that remain with ED during pendency of the case; often, a long-drawn out process spanning many years which compounds the woes of the duped.The Kolkata court and ED have found a way out in Section 8(8) of PMLA under which attached assets confiscated by ED can be restored to ""a claimant with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of the offence of money laundering"". ED has to prepare panchnama for such transfer of attached property which may be used as evidence during trial, according to the law.Although there is no clarity on the amendments government is planning to bring to help victims, given the PM's focus during the campaign, ED is all set to to use the Kolkata court order as a precedent.The restitution in the Rose Valley case is based on an earlier direction from Calcutta High Court where it had constituted the ADC headed by Justice Dilip Kumar Seth, former judge of Calcutta HC, to sell the assets of the accused company situated in West Bengal in public auction and the sale proceeds to be deposited in a separate account to be opened by the committee. Significantly, the special court, while passing the landmark order, also factored in the possibility of acquittal of the accused, a prospect which is a deterrent for govt's plan to compensate the duped.""I have also taken into account the eventuality, that is to say, suppose the accused are acquitted after trial, and then what will be the effect of such restoration order? The answer is, whatever is the result of the trial, the investors would get their money returned,"" the special court judge said.The order further justified the restitution and said, ""It is appropriate and rational that the money should be utilised in returning the bankrupt investors and depositors instead of keeping it idle as NPA for a prolonged period because the trial in money laundering offence takes time to complete.""","ED will start with disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore in attached fixed deposits (FDs) of Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors.

KOZHIKODE: In a different time, 18-year-old hotel management student Abhijith Kallingal would have gone for a long, leisurely stroll in his village of Punchirimattom to capture its lush green hills and waterfalls with his mobile phone, as he did almost every day. But this is now. Sitting in a relief camp in Meppadi's government high school this weekend, he was deleting these cherished photos, unable to bear the memories they evoked.Abhijith's life was shattered when a landslide early Tuesday flattened his village and claimed the lives of his entire family , eight in all - including his parents, siblings, grandmother, uncle, aunt, cousin, and four close neighbours who had sought refuge in his home as it rained nonstop for two days in Wayanad.The teenager survived only because he was away in Thiruvananthapuram for his studies. His once safe and beautiful village, often photographed and shared with friends, became the site of an unimaginable tragedy .Abhijith's home, perceived as safe due to its elevated location, was completely destroyed. All its 12 occupants at the time perished. The bodies of his father, sister, uncle, and aunt were found in the rubble, but his mother, brother, grandmother, and cousin remain missing. Adding to his grief, Abhijith lost an aunt who was visiting relatives in Chooralmala - the site of another devastating landslide.Abhijith is left alone, accompanied only by his cousin Pranav, the sole survivor from his uncle Narayanan's family. Amidst his trauma, Abhijith left the relief camp to perform the last rites of his father and sister at the Mariyammam temple funeral grounds. ""Our village was so beautiful. I had taken so many images. I have deleted most of them. What is the use of keeping them when everything is lost?"" he said.

Claiming to be ""repentant"" of his comments, he said in the same breath that there was ""no question"" of him apologising to ""a state officer"".On Saturday, Giri launched a volley of verbal abuse on Shaw, calling her ""beyadob (discourteous)"" and a ""janowar (beast)"".He also told the officer how to behave, screaming at her, ""A state employee should talk with his/her heads bowed down."" Shaw, 36, had earned the minister's wrath for refuting local allegations of high-handed behaviour after an anti-encroachment drive on forest land on the Tajpur coastline.Giri is no stranger to such controversy . In Nov 2022, he had earned the party's wrath and censure for objectionable comments against President Droupadi Murmu, with Trinamool chief and CM Mamata Banerjee even publicly apologising on his behalf. The party had also warned him against making such comments.On Saturday, Trinamool state president Subrata Bakshi called up Giri and told him that he had to either resign from the cabinet or face expulsion. Bakshi also made it clear that Banerjee was angry and pained at the manner in which he had abused and threatened Shaw. Senior party functionary Kunal Ghosh also said that Trinamool had not taken kindly to Giri's outburst, admonishing him and asking him to apologise to the officer.The Forest Rangers' Association (West Bengal) wrote to Banerjee, seeking action against Giri for ""intimidating a colleague"" on duty. Members of the association also observed an hour-long protest by attending office wearing black badges. Sensing the mood, forest minister Birbaha Hansda called up Shaw and spoke to her. Shaw herself has refused to speak to the media.On Sunday morning, Giri hastily convened a press meet, where he told reporters he ""repents"" his action. ""I should not have said that, but I cannot take back what I said. The forest officer's misbehaviour with the locals infuriated me,"" he said. But he added he would not call her to apologise. ""I have never apologised to a state officer, and I never will,"" he said.Bengal prisons minister Akhil Giri, who resigned from state cabinet on Sunday, even acknowledged that ""CM Mamata Banerjee is very pained"" at his unseemly outburst against forest ranger Manisha Shaw.""Perhaps that is why she has taken this decision,"" he said. ""But I will go to no one to plead (for myself). I have never done it in the past. I will email by resignation (from the cabinet) today. A hard copy will be sent on Monday,"" he added.Banerjee is scheduled to chair a cabinet meeting on Monday.Giri said he had been an MLA multiple times and became a cabinet minister in 2022. ""I will continue to work for the people,"" he said. Asked why he was siding with illegal encroachers, staking his own political career, he said: ""They are not encroachers.

The then advocate general, Satish Chandra Verma, had been liaisoning between the two and the judge, ED has claimed.Though ED's August 1 affidavit does not name the judge in question, annexures containing WhatsApp chat details show he was Justice Arvind Kumar Chandel, with ED stating he was approached through his brother and former state chief secretary Ajay Singh.Chandel was transferred to Patna HC this year.ED has claimed the two bureaucrats in the then Baghel-led Congress govt were tampering with evidence to dilute the case against them.The accused through the then advocate general were in touch with the judge of Chhattisgarh HC who had granted anticipatory bail to Shukla on October 16, 2019. Tuteja was in touch with the judge through (then) AG Satish Chandra Verma as is evident from WhatsApp messages of July 31 and Aug 11 of 2019, Enforcement Directorate (ED) said.“WhatsApp messages exchange has revealed that biodata of the daughter and son-in-law of the judge were sent to Tuteja for favourable action by then AG who has been liasoning between the judge and both the prime accused Tuteja and Shukla,” it added.“Tuteja and Shukla were (also) in touch with the judge’s brother (Ajay Singh) regarding the matter of anticipatory bail of accused Shukla, which was pending before the bench of the ju-dge.

He directed DM (South East) to get all the encroachment cleared by joint action and restore the bridge to its original state within a week.Four JCB machines were deployed to clean the drains. The LG has directed the officials to deploy more machines to unclog the drains. Both Sunehri and Kushak Nalla belong to the MCD.Expressing his displeasure at the condition of drains and the inaction on the part of the concerned agencies, LG directed urgent corrective measures to ensure a smooth flow of water to mitigate flooding.The officials were also instructed to clear the encroachments along these arterial drains. He directed the officials to fence the drains to prevent the dumping of garbage and debris in the drains. He asked them to monitor the drains through CCTV cameras and take action against those found dumping waste into the drains, officials said.Responding to LG's visit, the AAP said, ""Sir, you arrived too late.

"Govt acknowledges climate change’s disproportionate impact on women and children, highlights lack of comprehensive audit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-acknowledges-climate-changes-disproportionate-impact-on-women-and-children-highlights-lack-of-comprehensive-audit/articleshow/112269648.cms,"NEW DELHI: Asserting its recognition of the adverse impact of climate change on women and children, the govt on Friday, in response to a question in Parliament, emphasised that it is now globally accepted that the “climate crisis and its impact are not gender-neutral.” The minister for women and child development, Annpurna Devi, however, also highlighted that so far, no audit regarding the impact of climate change on women and children has been conducted by her ministry or the ministry of environment, forests and climate change.She was responding to a written question in Lok Sabha raised by B K Parthasarathi (TDP) in which among other things he sought to know if any audit has been conducted.The minister said that according to Third National Communication (TNC), submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dec 2023, women, especially those from lower economic backgrounds, face some of the most severe effects of climate change.She further said that UNICEF has recognised that children face additional vulnerabilities due to certain factors. For instance, they are more prone to dehydration due to their lower ability to regulate body temperature, making them more vulnerable to heat waves and high temperatures. Also climate change may cause crop failures and rising prices, which in turn may lead to increased rates of malnutrition among children.The minister shared the findings of a study done this year by MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). It examines the implications of climate change on women and children across various agro-ecological zones in India and reveals that women and children in Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Telangana are especially vulnerable to climate-related disasters.“Children exposed to climate hazards are more likely to experience stunting, underweight conditions, and increased susceptibility to early pregnancies. According to the study, exposure to drought events raises the likelihood of underweight women by 35%, child marriage by 37%, teenage pregnancy by 17% and intimate partner violence by up to 50%,” she said.On the response to the challenges, the WCD minister said, “The govt recognises the adverse impact of climate change on women and children and has taken several steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities.”Besides the fact that the govt implements the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), the minister highlighted the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) launched by the health ministry in 2019 to reduce morbidity, mortality, injuries and health vulnerabilities to climate variability and extreme weather events especially among vulnerable groups like women, children and marginalised communities.","The govt on Friday emphasised that it is now globally accepted that the “climate crisis and its impact are not gender-neutral” The minister for women and child development, Annpurna Devi, however, also highlighted that so far, no audit regarding the impact of climate change on women and children has been conducted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112269643,imgsize-1052452,width-400,resizemode-4/112269643.jpg"

'Financial meltdown in the state,' says West Bengal guv

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday responded to claims made by Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) MP Derek O’Brien regarding the withholding of MGNREGA funds for West Bengal. O’Brien had accused the central government of failing to release funds for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, but the BJP argued that the halt is due to financial mismanagement by the TMC-led state government.The BJP accused the TMC of attempting to manipulate the issue for political gain. According to the BJP, the suspension of MGNREGA funds, which began on March 9, 2022, is not politically motivated but is a response to financial irregularities uncovered during audits by the central government. These audits, conducted between 2019 and 2021, found substantial misappropriation of funds by the TMC government, amounting to Rs 537.05 lakh, which prompted the central government to recommend recovery.""TMC’s habitual engagement in duplicity and capriciousness is once again laid bare through the mendacious tweet by Derek O’Brien. In his attempt to hoodwink the innocent voters of Bengal, he blamed the Central Govt for failing to release funds under MGNREGA,"" BJP said in a post on X.The BJP said that the TMC’s responses, including an Action Taken Report submitted in June 2019, have been inadequate. The state’s continued non-compliance led to the invocation of Section 27 of the MGNREGA Act, justifying the fund stoppage. As of July 25, 2024, the central government reiterated its request for updates on recovery and disciplinary actions, noting that only Rs 161.64 lakh of the misappropriated funds have been recovered.""It is high time for TMC to finally accept their involvement in the debacle and take action against the Chief of the Loot - Mamata Banerjee!"" the saffron party said.O’Brien's claimed the Modi government has admitted in Parliament that West Bengal received ""zero"" funds under MGNREGA. He cited a reply from the Union minister of state for rural development, Kamlesh Paswan, which showed zero households completed 100 days of employment in 2023-24. However, the data also indicated that 1,618 households completed the work in 2022-23, and 4,71,136 in 2021-22, before the funding halt.""Finally! Modi Govt admits inside Parliament that BENGAL'S BEEN GIVEN ZERO for MNREGA funds,"" the TMC MP said in his post on X.The BJP's accusations came on a day when the West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose Governor said there were loopholes in the financial management of West Bengal. Bose said that there is a financial meltdown in West Bengal, and claimed that funds that are meant for poverty alleviation are being used for other purposes in the state.""This is an opinion which stems directly from the analysis given by competent authorities like the Reserve Bank of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General...I am sorry to say that there is a financial meltdown in West Bengal...Funds are diverted, funds which are meant for the amelioration of poverty are used for other purposes,"" Bose told news agency ANI.The West Bengal Governor added that he has asked for a white paper from the state government.""It is mandatory for the CM to provide such information to the Governor...I will wait for it. If it comes well and good. If it doesn't come, there are ways I get for that,"" Bose told ANI.",BJP responded to claims made by Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) MP Derek O’Brien regarding the withholding of MGNREGA funds for West Bengal.
