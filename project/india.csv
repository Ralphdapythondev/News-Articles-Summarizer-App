"In violence-scarred Gohana, Congress has edge as farm stir, Agnipath & jobs top poll agenda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-violence-scarred-gohana-congress-has-edge-as-farm-stir-agnipath-jobs-top-poll-agenda/articleshow/113581112.cms,"GOHANA: In 2005, Gohana was rocked by inter-caste violence. Around 50 Dalit homes were ransacked - some almost turned to ruins - in this small town in Haryana 's Sonipat. The ravagers were incensed after a Jat was killed following an altercation with a group of Dalits over an alleged slur made a few days before.Nearly two decades later, bitter memories of that long nightmare have receded to the background.In Valmiki Basti, the wrecked homes have been rebuilt; several doubled-storeyed now. Contractor Tilak Ram, old enough to remember, and 50-year-old peon Madan Lal, profess that the aggression of dominant castes has gone down considerably since then.But younger Dalits in the colony have other problems to talk about. Naveen Sawan, a graduate who plays local cricket and repairs bats for a living, bemoans lack of jobs. His elder brother says, ""Upar Modi theek hai. Par yahan badlao chahiye (Modi is okay at the Centre, but we need change in the state)."" The colony's vote, he proffers while others nod, is largely divided between Congress and BJP . Others in the fray - Dushyant Chautala's JJP and Abhay Singh Chautala's INLD, which is in alliance with BSP - don't figure in the discussion. Neither does AAP, contesting all 90 seats. Gohana assembly seat has 19% SC voters.Electioneering is at its peak in this bustling town, also famous among foodies for its giant jalebis. Vehicles flaunting party flags are brimful of robust men. Even independents are campaigning with gusto, notably Harsh Chikara, a young Jat social worker whose posters are prominent across the town and outside.Four-time MLA Jagbir Singh Malik of Congress won the last three polls. His vote share, though, has declined from 42% in 2009 to 33% in 2019. The 74-year-old Jat politician, a graduate in legislative law, faces BJP's Arvind Kumar Sharma, a 61-year-old dental surgeon and a four-term MP from an assortment of parties. Sharma lost badly on a BJP ticket to Congressman Deepender Singh Hooda in this year's Lok Sabha polls in Rohtak; he had defeated the same opponent narrowly five years earlier. ""He has been brought in to end the long reign of Malik,"" says Sonu Bamania, a Dalit who makes seats for automobiles.Mobile store owner Dinanath Chawla says Sharma is a good candidate for BJP, especially since the assembly seat has seen little development in the Malik years. But fellow shopkeeper Kartikay Mehta says that Sharma is being looked at as an outsider. ""BJP will muster decent votes in the town but Congress is stronger in the surrounding Jat-dominated villages. That's Malik's stronghold,"" he says. About 72% of Gohana voters are rural, according to chanakya.com.Like several other states both in north and south India, caste is embedded in Haryana society and politics. Pundits often see Haryana's politics as a binary between Jats and non-Jats. Roughly 1/4th of the state's total population, Jats are Haryana's single-largest caste and have traditionally lorded over state politics. The situation changed in 2014 when BJP swept the state polls and Manohar Lal Khattar, an RSS pracharak and a Punjabi, was made the CM. Shortly before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC, replaced him. BJP's slogan for the Oct 5 assembly polls is: ""Non-stop Vikas, Sabka Viswas (Non-stop Development, Everyone's Trust).""In Khandrai village, a mixed group of young and elderly Jats are unimpressed. The community seems to be gravitating in bulk towards Congress despite other parties led by Jat politicians in the fray. Their decision-making is spurred by the fact that the Congress campaign is spearheaded by former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, a Jat, and his son Deepender. Incidentally, the Gohana violence happened under Hooda's watch as CM.Local farmer leader Ashok Lathwa lists lathicharge on protesters during the farmers' agitation (2021 and 2023), the Agnipath scheme and widespread unemployment as three key subjects of grievances against BJP regime.","In 2005, Gohana was rocked by inter-caste violence.

UP medical aspirants converting religion to secure MBBS seats: A look at NEET UG admission criteria around minority reservation rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/up-medical-aspirants-converting-religion-to-secure-mbbs-seats-a-look-at-neet-ug-admission-criteria-around-minority-reservation-rules/articleshow/113364399.cms,"NEET UG Admission Criteria and Minority Reservation Explained

What is the Application Process for Minority Quota in NEET Counselling

A startling case has surfaced in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, where more than a dozen medical aspirants allegedly underwent religious conversion to secure admission to minority medical colleges . This troubling incident, now under investigation by local authorities, is believed to contravene the provisions of the Unlawful Conversions of Religion Act of 2021 (UPPUCRA-2021).The individuals involved hail from various regions, including several districts in Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and Maharashtra. According to media reports, the Uttar Pradesh Home Department and other relevant authorities are aware of the ongoing probe.A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law. Of these, seven admissions were cancelled by the counselling board, while seven others voluntarily withdrew. The remaining six candidates, all from outside Uttar Pradesh, have had their documents forwarded to their respective states for verification before any legal action is taken. In response to the incident, the Directorate of Medical Education has instructed the counselling committee to thoroughly investigate the matter and verify the certificates submitted in various admission categories.Admissions to all undergraduate medical and dental courses across India are primarily conducted through NEET (UG). Various categories of seats are available, including those under the All India Quota, state government quotas, central institutions, deemed universities, and private medical or dental colleges. This system also includes seats under management and NRI quotas, with some institutions specifically catering to minority communities. Minority quotas in private, unaided, and aided minority medical colleges are also a crucial component of the admission process.Institutions such as AIIMS and JIPMER conduct their own admissions under specific categories, while the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) oversees the process for central institutions and deemed universities.Minority reservation criteria for NEET UG admissions are based on a complex interplay between state and central government regulations. The status of a minority community varies by state, and a separate list is maintained for All India Quota seats by the central government. State-specific criteria may also apply, requiring candidates to have attended a minority college or institution for part of their education to qualify for the reserved seats. This ensures that both regional and national considerations are balanced in the distribution of these quotas.The process for securing a seat under the minority quota in NEET counselling can differ based on the type of counselling. State counselling is typically centralised and managed by state authorities, where minority quota seats are part of the broader allocation process. Conversely, certain private or minority-run institutions conduct their own college-based counselling, requiring candidates to apply directly to the institution to claim a minority seat. Candidates participating in either of these processes must meet the specific eligibility requirements, including the submission of valid minority status certificates .For minority quota admissions, a separate merit list is created, considering NEET scores and other factors such as qualifying exam marks in some states. The selection process usually involves multiple rounds of counselling to fill any remaining seats. Upon selection, candidates must provide all relevant documentation, including NEET scores, educational certificates, and proof of minority status.In cases where an institution claims minority status, the application for a Minority Status Certificate (MSC) must first be submitted to the authority designated by the state government, as outlined by the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions. This process is critical for ensuring the proper distribution of seats under the minority reservation policy in medical admissions.","A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law.

"'Tirupati laddu ghee had pig & beef fat, fish oil': Row rages in Andhra Pradesh; TDP, YSRCP lock horns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tirupati-laddu-row-lab-reports-confirm-lard-tallow-in-ghee-supplied-for-tirumala/articleshow/113499408.cms,"TIRUPATI: The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam during the term of the YSRC govt . It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam. It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil. The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113499554,imgsize-1626091,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113499554.jpg"
'Detonators' put on way of Army train set off alarm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/detonators-put-on-way-of-army-train-set-off-alarm/articleshow/113578047.cms,"Since Aug this year, at least six alleged attempts have been made in UP to sabotage railway operations.

Cops: Train was carrying Army personnel and weapons

INDORE/KANPUR: In what seems to be yet more attempts to sabotage railway operations, it has come to light that railway ' detonators ' were placed on tracks in Madhya Pradesh 's Ratlam on September 18 when an Army special train was passing through. The revelation came on a day when an empty gas cylinder was found on the tracks at Prempur station near Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur.Since Aug this year, at least six alleged attempts have been made in UP to sabotage railway operations.In MP's Burhanpur district, the 10 'railway detonators' were found placed at intervals of a metre each. The railways called it an ""attempt at mischief"". The Army has requested custody of certain key railway personnel, including signalmen and trackmen, for questioning as part of the probe.Sources said a gangman has been detained but there is no official confirmation. He is alleged to have done this in a drunken rage.The train, headed for Thiruvananthapuram, was carrying Army personnel and weapons, police sources said. A couple of the detonators — more like firecrackers — exploded when the train passed over them. The loco pilot pulled the brakes the moment he heard the first explosion. The train was halted for half an hour at Sagphata station, while the area was inspected.“Ten railway detonators were placed over a 10m distance on the Mumbai rail route between Sagphata and Dongargaon railway stations,” Dr Swapnil Nila, chief public relations officer of Central Railway, told TOI.In the incident near Kanpur, the 5-litre cylinder was removed from the tracks by police after a thorough examination. “Around 5.50am, locopilots Dev Anand Gupta and C B Singh of the Jorhat-bound freight train spotted an empty cylinder on the tracks ahead of the signal. The crew promptly applied emergency brakes to avert a potential catastrophe,” read a statement issued by North Central Railway (NCR). Two empty beer cans and a snack wrapper were also found on the scene.“The cylinder was placed a mere 30m from the signal. Kanpur Police, RPF and GRP are investigating,” said Om Narayan Singh, SHO of Kanpur Central GRP. “Though the probability of derailment was minuscule as the train’s momentum would have likely propelled the cylinder away, the deliberate placement of the gas cylinder on the track indicates sabotage,” Kanpur police said.However, the incident near Ratlam in MP rang the alarm bells . Officers from NIA , the Army, anti-terrorism squad, railways and police inspected the site. “While it seems this was done without reason, an inquiry is being conducted by RPF,” said CPRO.","An empty gas cylinder was found on the tracks at Prempur station near Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur.

New Lankan president: A curveball India prepared for; Anura Kumara Dissanayake against Adani project but backs Indian security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-lankan-president-a-curveball-india-prepared-for-akd-against-adani-project-but-backs-indian-security/articleshow/113576472.cms,"NEW DELHI: With Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake winning the hotly contested Sri Lankan presidential poll, India is faced with another challenge in the neighbourhood of dealing with a leader who remains a relatively unknown quantity. However, with its $ 4 billion-worth assistance that helped Lanka tide over an unprecedented economic crisis and recent outreach that had the Indian government hosting him earlier this year, India is perhaps in a lot better position to absorb the shock than it was in Bangladesh.India’s high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him, saying India, as a civilisational twin, was committed to deepening ties for the prosperity of the people of both countries.After his swearing-in on Monday, the 55-year-old National People’s Power alliance leader will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. A marginal player till now in Lankan politics, who got only 3 percent votes in the last election, Dissanayake defeated the pro-India leader of opposition, Sajith Premadasa, after a historic counting of second preference votes, as no candidate could get more than 50 percent votes. He eventually won with 42.31 percent votes.While India followed the elections with a non-partisan approach, it would have ideally liked incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe or Premadasa to win for the sake of continuity, if nothing else. This would have allowed a more sure-footed Indian government to build upon the goodwill generated by its recent handholding of the strategically important Indian Ocean neighbour through a period of acute crisis.Despite the traditionally anti-India stance of his Marxist- Leninist party JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), the Indian government reached out to Dissanayake, popularly known as AKD, in February inviting him to visit the country. The invitation acknowledged his increasing popularity, especially among the youth, on the back of widespread anger over the mishandling of the crisis and a pro-poor, anti-corruption “agent of change’’ image that proved decisive in an election dominated by issues related toSri Lanka ’s economic recovery. These included a controversial IMF bailout deal he wants renegotiated. Both foreign minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval met him in Delhi.Interestingly, during his visit to India, Dissanayake agreed to visit the Amul plant in Gujarat after alleging that the Indian dairy giant was planning to take over dozens of Lankan state owned dairies.The Indian mission in Colombo has remained in regular contact with Dissanayake.For India, the key priorities in Sri Lanka remain the need to address the requirements of the India-origin Tamil community, including full implementation of the 1987 13th Amendment to the Constitution, expediting connectivity, energy and other projects as China expands its footprint and a more humanitarian approach towards Indian fishermen. It’s also important for India that Sri Lanka, in line with a bilateral agreement, doesn’t allow China military use of its ports in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests.While many have speculated that Dissanayake might seek stronger ties with China, it’s important for India that he said recently he won’t allow anyone to use his country’s sea, land and airspace to threaten India.The socialist leader made headlines recently by saying he will scrap a wind power project by the Adani group , which has run into problems because of environmental issues, saying it violates Sri Lanka’s “energy sovereignty”. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which promotes cross-border trade and investment, is said to have emphasised before Dissanayake that the project might help attract more investments into the country.Dissanayake is also learnt to have expressed concerns before Indian officials about corruption and lack of transparency in the execution of some of Chinese flagship projects, like the Hambantota port and Colombo port city project. India believes that while he might look to remodel some of the projects, it’s unlikely he will revoke any. “His focus on corruption and the need for transparency is in line with India’s stand against opaque lending practices. Indian projects are based on the needs of the local people,’’ said an official here.Dissanayake has sounded ambivalent about the 13th Amendment and his party has strongly opposed the 1987 India-Sri Lanka accord but, barring Premadasa, no other major candidate, not even Wickremesinghe, had promised its full implementation. While seeking Constitutional changes, Dissanayake has said it’s important to implement provisions that can establish peace and to focus on the future, not the past. ``To do that, Tamil people should be given a strong guarantee of rights in politics. They must be given a right to make decisions for themselves,’’ he said earlier this year.","Anura Kumara Dissanayake will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. India's high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him.

The remarks, seen as a reference to the passing of Anna Sebastian Perayil , have drawn sharp criticism from opposition party Congress, with some calling her comments ""outright cruel.""Perayil, who passed her CA exams in 2023, had been working at EY's Pune office for just four months before her death in July.In a letter to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani, Perayil's mother alleged that her daughter had been overworked, facing a ""backbreaking"" workload that affected her ""physically, emotionally, and mentally."" The government has announced an investigation into the work environment at EY following her death.Speaking at an event at a private medical college on Saturday, Sitharaman discussed the incident without directly naming Perayil or EY.""…A woman who had studied CA well, unable to cope with the work pressure ... two-three days ago, we received a news—she died unable to cope up with the pressure,"" Sitharaman said.She emphasized that while educational institutions prepare students academically, they must also impart life lessons, particularly in stress management and inner strength, which she linked to spirituality.""What should families teach—whatever you study and the job you do, you should have the inner strength to handle that pressure, and this can be achieved through divinity only,"" Sitharaman stated. ""Believe in God, we need to have God's grace. Seek God, learn good discipline. Your Atma shakti will grow only from this. The inner strength will come only with growing Atma shakti.""Sitharaman called on colleges and universities to integrate divinity and spirituality into their curriculum to help students cope with life's pressures. ""Then only will our children get the inner strength; it will help in the progress of them and the country. That is my strong belief,"" she added.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, however, strongly condemned Sitharaman's remarks, accusing the government of being insensitive to the plight of young professionals.""It is downright cruel on the part of the finance minister to blame Anna and her family by suggesting that she should have learned stress management at home. This kind of victim-blaming is despicable, and no words can convey the anger and disgust one feels because of such statements,"" Venugopal said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).He also criticized the government for failing to address corporate exploitation of young professionals, adding, ""The toxic work environment should have triggered an honest review of corporate practices and led to necessary reforms that protect employees.""The government has yet to respond to the Congress leader's statements.","Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has urged educational institutions to include stress management lessons.

Instead of such direct acquisitions, India is now pushing for co-development and co-production of advanced weapon systems under the ambitious defence-industrial cooperation roadmap finalized in June last year.While no such joint project has been sealed till now, Modi and Biden “recognised the remarkable progress” achieved under the roadmap, including “ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems”.India and the US, for instance, are conducting techno-commercial negotiations to jointly produce GE-F414 jet engines for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters here, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The fact-sheet also mentioned that the US demonstrated its Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicle, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, on the margins of the joint `Yudh Abhyas’ exercise that concluded in Rajasthan on Saturday.TOI had earlier reported that the discussions were in an advanced stage for the joint manufacture of the eight-wheeled Strykers, with the Indian Army projecting a requirement for around 530 such vehicles, though there is some criticism about indigenous options being ignored in the process.The two leaders also welcomed efforts to expand other defence-industrial partnerships, including for the co-development and co-production of unmanned surface vehicle systems to strengthen undersea and maritime domain awareness, as well as enhance India's MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) capabilities for the repair of aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.Modi and Biden also lauded ongoing efforts to deepen the bilateral military partnership and interoperability to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, noting that India hosted the largest and most complex bilateral tri-Service exercise “Tiger Triumph” till date in March.“The leaders commended work to advance cooperation in advanced domains, including space and cyber, and looked forward towards the Nov 2024 bilateral cyber engagement to enhance the cyber cooperation framework. Areas of new cooperation will include threat information sharing, cybersecurity training, and collaboration on vulnerability mitigation in energy and telecommunications networks,” it said.Under a MoU on the deployment of military liaison officers, India will now post a Colonel-rank officer to the US Special Operations Command at Florida, while another officer will go to the Indo-Pacific Command at Hawaii.","The govt-to-govt deal for the 31 high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), with 15 Sea Guardian drones earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, is set to be inked in mid-Oct.

'Dynastic influence' & NC's social engineering at play in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dynastic-influence-ncs-social-engineering-at-play-in-kashmir/articleshow/113581085.cms,"KANGAN (GANDERBAL): Without any questions, Mehar Ali , short, frail and unassuming, has eased into the role of his father Mian Altaf Ahmad, National Conference MLA since 1987, as the candidate from Kangan constituency in Ganderbal.Yet another dynasty? Well, this is one that even Narendra Modi, the heat-seeking missile against political families of opposition, would keep away from.For, Ahmad represents the high spiritual seat revered by the Gujjar-Bakerwal communities across J&K, and his family going back to grandfather have represented Kangan since 1962. In 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Ahmad defeated PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti in Anantnag, the vacant assembly now filled by his son.Debutant Ali rubbishes Modi's attack line of ""dynasty"", telling TOI, ""What dynasty? The 'awam (people)' has elected us. People will decide if they like dynasty or not."" Ahmad underscored the point. ""I am a third-generation dynast and my son is fourth. People vote for us. Dynasties work hard to earn support. It is about merit, that's how I understand.""He reasoned that a doctor's child becomes a doctor and a journalist's son becomes a journalist. ""We cultivate relationships over generations, and it is not easy to leave people midway. That's how it continues."" The ease of answer and manners, as also father-son's short stature, hides the clout that the family wields across the two regions sizzling in the heat of the battle royale.From the border areas of Jammu to deep inside Kashmir, the tribals hold the family in high esteem, its religious influence seamlessly blending with politics and creating poll winners.A loyal National Conference member, Ahmad Friday accompanied Omar Abdullah to Poonch and Rajouri for campaigning and was back in his village Babanagri at night - enough to explain his reach across regional faultlines. The tribal politics has become competitive with BJP's pre-poll decision to include the Pahari community in ST list with separate quota.Curiously, through the Mian family, one realises the social engineering and heartland style that National Conference has weaved to aggregate votes this year.In 2024 Lok Sabha contest, it fielded Ahmad from Anantnag-Rajouri seat to add the tribal votes to its base to defeat Mehbooba, and nominated a Shia cleric and veteran MLA Syed Aga Ruhullah Mehdi from Srinagar to present a diverse mix with appeal to the minority sect that populates Srinagar-Budgam and adjoining areas.

There was palpable resentment against her for allowing her ""ambition"" to get the better of loyalty and forgetting what the party had done for her.

On Saturday, Kharge was quoted by a TV channel as saying Selja was a senior functionary loyal to Congress and that the party did not need advice from BJP.Khattar, a Union minister, had on Saturday asked Selja, a prominent Dalit face seen to be close to the Gandhi family, to join BJP and accused Congress of ignoring her. Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini too had attacked Congress. When Congress released its seven guarantees for Haryana at a press conference at the party headquarters on Sep 18, neither Selja nor Surjewala were present. Haryana state unit chief Udai Bhan and Hooda were present.","Kumari Selja is said to be feeling marginalised ever since the Congress leadership reposed faith in her factional rival Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

Die is cast: Hindu refugee families from Pakistan to vote first time since 1947,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/die-is-cast-hindu-refugee-families-from-pakistan-to-vote-first-time-since-1947/articleshow/113577268.cms,"SRINAGAR: For the first time since their ancestors migrated from Pakistan to J&K during the 1947 Partition, over 5,000 Hindu families will vote in the ongoing assembly elections .Forced to live in 39 squalid camps near Jammu for over seven decades because Article 370 on J&K’s special status denied them land and other rights, these refugees are looking forward to the Oct 1 polls as a watershed moment.The right to exercise their franchise follows Article 370’s abrogation in Aug 2019, a move which cleared the way for granting these refugees permanent resident status after decades of political marginalisation.To add to their political heft, two seats have been reserved for these immigrants in the assembly. The Centre will nominate the two members.“For us, voting day will be a festival,” said Labhu Ram, president of West Pakistan Refugee Action Committee, adding the families will celebrate the ballot with special dishes like puri-halwa and laddus to express excitement and gratitude for this long-awaited opportunity.The ancestors of the refugees, numbering around 5,700 and mostly from Scheduled Castes (SCs), have lived so far without many of the rights and privileges enjoyed by residents. “The abrogation brought about a seismic shift in our political status, finally allowing us full participation in the electoral process. Till now, we were living as second-class citizens. This basic democratic right was snatched away from us by those who today claim to safeguard democratic institutions,” said Des Raj, a camp resident, alluding possibly to J&K-based parties.Some of the refugees were forced to leave areas of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan in 1947, while others came from areas of Sialkot, bordering Jammu. They were provided land in Jammu in 1960s but Article 370 --- which barred outsiders from owning land in J&K -- meant no ownership rights. This prevented them from getting benefits of govt housing schemes or access to bank loans. These refugee families were treated as “non-state subjects” as they not were not residents of the then princely state of J&K during the 1947 Partition.Ahead of a Supreme Court-stipulated Sept 30 deadline for holding the assembly polls, J&K administration on Aug 2 this year granted the refugees proprietary rights to the “state land” on which their ancestors were settled by the then govt decades ago.The Hindu refugees ’ livelihood and survival problems date back to the 1974 Partition, based on the nation theory, which led to large-scale cross-border migration and mayhem. In those tumultuous days, many Hindu families fled villages in Pakistan’s Sialkot and came to neighbouring Jammu’s Kathua and RS Pura areas. While some stayed back in Jammu, many others left and settled in Punjab, Delhi and other states of India.The main reason for the influx into Jammu was connectivity: Sialkot was then linked to Jammu by rail and road. Such people also shared cultural and economic affinity with Dogras of Jammu. According to some historians, many of the refugees had relatives in border villages of Jammu, leading them to be welcomed in the initial years of the crisis.","For the first time since their ancestors migrated from Pakistan to J&K during the 1947 Partition, over 5,000 Hindu families will vote in the ongoing assembly elections.

Among the most famous Indian engineers of the 20th century was the legendary Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. What factors prompted you to pick him as the subject of your new biography 'Engineering a Nation'?



To explore Visvesvaraya's life, the book argues, is to understand the emergence of the Indian nation itself...



The 500-odd-page biography is suffixed by 200 pages of citations. Walk us through the research process.



A museum, a college, a terminal, a memorial trophy-- Visvesvaraya's name lives on in many forms in Karnataka. Is his legacy well-known outside the state? Do you think he received his due?



What role did Bombay play in his trajectory?



While Gandhi was against the idea of industrialisation, Visvesvaraya swore by it as a tool for nation-building. Did the two men see eye-to-eye?



Much like your subject, you too chose to go abroad. After studying electrical engineering, you pursued postgraduate work in the history of science, medicine and technology at Oxford University (MSc) and Imperial College London (PhD). What prompted this leap from science to history/from the future to the past of the future, if you will?



The Indian Science Congress--a 1914-born annual forum in which a lot of attendees in recent years have made controversial claims about India's achievements in the history of science spanning the existence of stem cell technology to fleets of aircraft in ancient India and Sri Lanka--did not happen this year. What does this (both the event and its cancellation) say about India's relationship with science and history? Also, did you miss it?



If he were alive, what would Visvesvaraya have to say about AI, UID, UPI and present-day India?

If he were alive, legendary 20th-century civil engineer Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya would likely be excited about AI , guesses historian Aparajith Ramnath whose book ' Engineering A Nation ' delves into the scientist's century-wide life and legacy. Apart from being an early proponent of economic planning and large-scale industrialisation, Mysore-born Visvesaraya--whose birthday on September 15 is celebrated as Engineer's Day in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania --was also an ardent technocrat whose work continues to touch sugarcane farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka, picnickers in the Brindavan Gardens, and city dwellers across the country who enjoy a piped water supply.Even as India grapples with politically skewed biographies and pseudo science, the author talks toabout the need for nuance while researching historically important scientists and engineers such as VisvevarayaSix years ago, your first book 'The Birth of an Indian Profession' explored the history of engineers in India between 1900 and 1947. How did the role of engineers evolve during these interwar years?In those years, new types of engineers came to prominence, namely those working in large-scale industries. (Earlier the profession was dominated by engineers in public works, railways, and the military.) Not only that, there was an increasing presence of Indian engineers as opposed to expat British engineers. A good example of the new type of engineer would be PN Mathur, a metallurgist who worked for Ford in the US before joining the Tata Iron and Steel Company in the 1920s.Like most of us, I’d heard of Visvesvaraya while growing up. While researching my first book, I kept coming across nuggets on him, and realised he was an exceptional figure. I was intrigued by the question of what made him so influential and legendary. What was the historical context in which he worked? How did his engineering expertise and his views on economic development take shape and evolve? To try and understand some of these things, I decided to research his life and career.Visvesvaraya lived from 1861 to 1962, a period that saw so many fundamental developments in the history of the Indian nation. Moreover, he was involved, directly or indirectly, with many of them: the popularisation of economic planning, the conception of constitutional autonomy within the British empire, the evolving status of the princely states, the emphasis on industrialisation and large dam projects. He worked with the most prominent Indian politicians of his time, but also with institution-builders, scientists, and engineers. He made technocracy fashionable, something that has reverberations down to the present day.I began by reading existing accounts of Visvesvaraya, which gave me a good sense of what was known about him and what had not been explored yet. I decided I wanted to rely on primary sources as far as possible. I went to various government and private archives in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mysuru. I found records related to his time in the Bombay PWD, studied his correspondence with politicians and others, and combed through his own extensive collection of government reports and newspaper cuttings. I also looked at records related to his close associates such as Walchand Hirachand. Digitised databases of official reports and newspapers from his time were immensely helpful. The biggest challenge was the subject’s reticence – he was a private person who didn’t leave behind too many personal letters or diaries, and it was difficult initially to probe beyond the public persona. But by immersing myself in the available sources, I hope I have been able to illuminate his personality and his thought process.You’re right, he’s ubiquitous in Karnataka. But while he enjoys name recall in other parts of the country, I don’t think his significance on the national stage is adequately appreciated. Yes, he had a huge influence on princely Mysore, but his canvas was much wider. He advised on dams and waterworks across undivided India and even in Aden. He worked closely with national politicians like MM Malaviya and MR Jayakar. He played a key role in bringing the concept of economic planning to the fore. He influenced technical education policy.Visvesvaraya spent close to 25 years in Poona and other parts of Bombay Presidency as a PWD engineer. During this time he absorbed the colonial philosophy of irrigation, but also made his own extensions based on his experiences, including that of famine in the Deccan. He got to know industrialists and intellectuals interested in national politics, especially MG Ranade and GK Gokhale. Later in life, he split his residence between Bangalore and Bombay city for many years. This meant he continued to be in close contact with developments in the industrial and commercial worlds, as well as with politicians on the national stage.The two shared a respectful relationship, and tried hard to find a meeting ground through their correspondence. But ultimately they were unable to agree on the question of large-scale industrialisation in particular, and of course their visions for India were quite different. I think Visvesvaraya’s views on the centrality of science and tech came partly from his education in colonial institutions, but mainly from his study tours to Japan, Europe, and America. Japan in particular was an important model for him.I drifted into engineering without thinking too deeply about my options. While I did alright in my studies, I found myself most excited by the courses I took outside of my main subject, and the general reading I was doing. After deep reflection, I realised I had a long-standing, if dormant, interest in history, and that I had questions about how we’d got to where we were in terms of engineering, IT, and related fields. This prompted me to switch fields. I think the time in graduate school abroad helped me understand my country a bit better by giving me some distance. Interacting with mentors and other scholars from around the world also helped broaden my perspective and look at Indian history as part of global developments.I’m not aware of the deeper reasons behind the cancellation/postponement—I think we’ll have to wait a year or two to understand its significance. But as far as historically unsupportable claims about science and tech in ancient India are concerned, they seem to indicate a deep insecurity. With the many strides India has made since Independence, isn’t it time to be more confident and look at our own past objectively?In the age of rampant misinformation, pseudo-science and questionable history textbooks, why is revisiting the professional lives of scientific and technical practitioners important?It’s important because there is a tendency to create icons, hollow out the complexity of their lives, and use them selectively to support present-day agendas. This points to the need for nuanced biographies in general. Especially when it comes to scientists and engineers, it’s always important to understand how their thinking evolved, how they were conditioned by the social and political context, and what assumptions they made. We need to look at primary sources in as much detail as possible, and study their lives with an open mind.Always difficult to answer these! My guess is that he would have been largely excited by the first three, to the extent that they could be applied to improve public health and material prosperity. Yet I think he would have been critical of several aspects of the present situation. He would find our cities disorderly, lament the continuing existence of poverty, and disapprove of the cultural chauvinism in much of today’s public discourse.",Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was one of the most famous Indian engineers of the 20th century.
