Kishor didn't mince words as he questioned Yadav's educational qualifications , pointing out that he failed to clear the 10grade despite his privileged background.Speaking at a gathering in Bhojpur, Bihar, Kishor said, ""If someone could not get educated because of lack of resources, it is understood.But if someone's parents are chief minister and he could not pass 10th class, then this shows their approach towards education.""Kishor further criticised Yadav's educational background and highlighted the irony, saying, ""A 9th fail is showing the way to Bihar's development. He (Tejashwi Yadav) doesn't know the difference between GDP and GDP growth and he will tell how Bihar will improve?""Kishor challenged Yadav's credentials, arguing that his only claim to leadership is being the son of former chief minister Lalu Yadav and a leader in RJD due to family ties . He highlighted that Yadav must work hard and prove himself through actions to build a reputation beyond his family name.Kishor also questioned Yadav's upcoming state tour, set to begin on September 10, urging him to connect with constituents on foot instead of relying on a convoy of vehicles and staged photo opportunities.He criticised Yadav's promises of government jobs as misleading, pointing out that the existing 23 lakh government employees in Bihar only account for 1.97 per cent of the population, and even if Yadav delivers on his promises, 98 per cent of the people would remain unaffected.Kishor also challenged Yadav to speak about socialism for five minutes without reading from a paper, implying that Yadav lacks the necessary understanding to discuss such concepts.Speaking on the caste census, Kishor supported its implementation but criticised the current political discourse surrounding it as a tool for political gain. He suggested that parties genuinely concerned about the issue should first implement the census in states where they hold power and provide economic benefits to the respective communities, including the Congress party in the states they govern.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav's ability to lead the state's development.

2 attacks revive wolf terror in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich after 6-day lull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/woman-saves-6-year-old-son-from-wolfs-jaws-in-ups-bahraich/articleshow/112974854.cms,"Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region of Uttar Pradesh

Lone wolf may be the killer, says expert

LUCKNOW: Two stealth attacks on people asleep outdoors broke a six-day lull in wolf terror in UP's Bahraich early on Sunday, starting with a six-year-old child being dragged away by his neck before the boy's muffled scream woke up his mother and led her to make a desperate lunge that scared away the predator.Gudiya, of Hardi village, had her son Paras next to her on a cot on the veranda of their home when the wolf sneaked up on them and targeted the child.The attack was eerily similar to the one in which a seven-year-old boy, Ayansh, was killed after being snatched from his sleeping mother in the same area on July 26.Paras was lucky to escape with bite marks in the neck region, just as 55-year-old Kunnu Lal of nearby Darhiya village, who was rescued by his family after a wolf pounced on him barely two hours after the first attack. ""I woke up to find my boy in the animal's jaws. I acted instinctively and pulled my son away with as much strength as I could muster. My cries for help alerted others and the wolf disappeared in the dark,"" Gudiya said.Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region. Over 20 people have been wounded. The attack on Paras took place around 2.30am. The child is being treated at Mahsi community health centre near the village. Kunnu Lal, who was taken to the same facility, had similar injuries. Divisional forest officer Ajeet Pratap Singh confirmed that both were wolf attacks.Over 150 provincial arm- ed constabulary personnel and 25 forest department teams have been deployed to tackle the wolf terror am- id reports the attacks might be by a single rogue animal.A lone wolf rather than a pack of six may have killed eight people — seven of them children — in Bahraich since March, biologist and ex-Wildlife Institute of India dean Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala said Sunday after a resurgence of nightly attacks in two adjacent villages in district, reports Pathikrit Chakraborty. Jhala, who has extensively studied wolf behaviour, said pattern of injuries indicated a single animal was involved in the fatal attacks so far. “If a pack of wolves were involved, the bodies would have been decapitated. In all the documented cases, the bodies were found intact,” he said.","Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region of Uttar Pradesh.

KOLKATA: Sanjay Roy , the prime accused in the rape-and-murder of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital doctor, in his first interaction with his lawyer in Presidency Jail , has told her that he wants to plead ""not guilty"" in court. Speaking with lawyer Kavita Sarkar , he also said he maintained his innocence in the polygraph test .According to lawyers in touch with Roy, during the polygraph test, he was asked about 10 questions, including what his next act was after committing the murder.Roy interrupted at this point and claimed that he had not committed the murder and such a question does not arise. He said he had entered the room and found the woman lying unconscious. His lawyers claimed that he was asked different questions, including his academic background. There were a few questions related to the incident.During this test - and in his interaction with Sarkar - Roy said he was being framed since he did not even know the woman. When he entered the room, he saw her covered in blood. He claimed that he rushed out of the spot as he panicked. When the CBI officers asked him why he did not inform the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital if he was not guilty, Roy said that he panicked and feared that none would believe his statements.Roy, who has been kept in a high-security ward in Presidency jail, has kept mostly to himself, jail officials said. ""There appears to be brooding, almost with a sense of fear, in the way he talks,"" an officer said, pointing out that he spoke at length with his lawyer under tight security.CBI officers, who have so far spoken to a number of witnesses, believe that Roy had been trying to shift focus and mislead the investigators. But Roy's lawyers claimed that his statement can be corroborated with theCCTV footage to ascertain the truth. ""If he had access to the seminar hall so easily, it shows that there was a security lapse on that night and someone else could also have taken advantage of that,"" said Sarkar, the lawyer appointed by Legal Aid Defence Counsel System for Roy.Sarkar said, ""The CBI has not shared anything related to the case with us. Roy is entitled to a free copy of the FIR. The agency has not even supplied that. Instead, we have been asked to procure a certified copy from the court.""","Sanjay Roy is prime accused in the rape-and-murder of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital doctor.

Special forces , or Special Operations Forces (SOF), are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics. Emerging in the early 20th century and expanding significantly during World War II, these forces have become vital for disruptive operations, including sabotage and covert strikes. Their primary role is to handle high-risk situations that demand precise and strategic intervention.Established by the Indian Navy in 1987, MARCOS excels in direct actions, special reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, and counter-terrorism.Known for their rigorous training and mental toughness, MARCOS are often referred to as the ""Dadiwala Fauj"" (Bearded Army) due to their disguises.India's premier counter-terrorism force, the NSG, is tasked with VIP security, anti-sabotage checks, and neutralising threats to critical infrastructure. With a demanding selection process that sees a 70–80% dropout rate, the NSG is split into the Special Action Group (SAG) and the Special Rangers Group (SRG).Formed in 1966, the Para SF is part of the Indian Army 's elite Parachute Regiment. These commandos specialise in rapid deployment behind enemy lines to disrupt and destroy key defensive positions.Created in 2004, the Garud Commando Force is the Indian Air Force’s special operations unit. It boasts the longest training period among Indian special forces—three years. Garud commandos are responsible for protecting air force bases, conducting rescue operations, and supporting air operations.Operating within the Indian Army, the Ghatak Force consists of elite infantry platoons that lead assaults and spearhead strikes. Each battalion has a Ghatak Platoon, composed of highly motivated and physically fit soldiers trained for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.A specialised unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), COBRA was formed to combat Naxalism. It is one of the few Indian forces exclusively trained in guerrilla warfare and has played a significant role in countering Naxalite groups.Established in 1962, the SFF was created for covert operations behind enemy lines, particularly in conflicts with China. Operating under India's external intelligence agency, RAW, the SFF reports directly to the Prime Minister and the Directorate General of Security.","Special forces, or Special Operations Forces, are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics.

However, it is currently awaiting approval from the CBFC (Central Board Of Film Certification), which has proposed several cuts due to the sensitive nature of the movie's subject matter.The series 'IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack,' created by Anubhav Sinha , has been accused of allegedly shifting the blame away from the Pakistani terrorists involved in the 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight. The Bharatiya Janata Party has also accused the series of validating the criminal intentions of the terrorists by using their non-Muslim aliases.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya expressed his concerns on X, stating, ""The hijackers of IC-814 were dreaded terrorists, who acquired aliases to hide their Muslim identities. Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, legitimised their criminal intent, by furthering their non-Muslim names. Result? Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814.""The series, directed by Sinha, is based on the 1999 hijacking of an Indian aircraft that took place on December 24, 1999, after the plane departed from Kathmandu, Nepal. The crisis concluded with the release of three terrorists – Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh, and Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar – in exchange for approximately 150 hostages.

"Govt approves mega Rs 26,000 crore deal for 240 aero-engines for Sukhoi-30MKI fighters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-mega-rs-26000-crore-deal-for-240-aero-engines-for-sukhoi-30mki-fighters/articleshow/113001721.cms,"NEW DELHI: A mega over Rs 26,000 crore deal to procure 240 aero-engines to power and sustain the Sukhoi-30MKI jets was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Monday, at a time when the IAF is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan.The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be procured from defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), which in turn will source some components from Russia .“The aero-engines will have an indigenous content of over 54%, enhanced due to indigenisation of some key components. The engines will be manufactured at the Koraput division of HAL ,” a defence ministry official said.The delivery of these aero-engines is slated to begin after one year, with the entire order being completed over eight years. The IAF currently has 259 Sukhois, the bulk of them licensed produced by HAL for over $12 billion from Russia, which constitute the backbone of its combat fleet.Another 12 new Sukhois along with associated equipment are now being ordered for around Rs 11,500 crore to replace the ones that crashed over the years.The CCS in Feb has also cleared new engines for the around 60 MiG-29 fighters in the IAF fleet for Rs 5,300 crore, which too will be manufactured by HAL with Russian collaboration.The IAF is now ordering aero-engines in bulk, instead of the earlier piecemeal orders, to bring down the costs and enhance the indigenous content. Engines need to be replaced at least two to three times during a fighter’s operational life.“Sukhois constitute one of the most powerful and strategically significant fleets of the IAF. The supply of these aero-engines by HAL would meet the fleet sustenance requirement to continue unhindered operations and strengthen the country’s defence preparedness,” the official said.India’s failure to indigenously produce aero-engines for fighters, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has been a major problem over the years. The delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by US firm General Electric, for instance, has hit the delivery timeframe of 83 indigenous Tejas Mark-1A jets to IAF, contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore contract in Feb 2021.India and the US are now, of course, also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines for the planned Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion, as reported by TOI earlier.On the Sukhoi front, there is also a major indigenous upgrade plan to make the existing fighters much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years. This Rs 63,000 crore project will also soon head for the final clearance by the CCS, as was earlier reported by TOI.","A mega over Rs 26,000 crore deal to procure 240 aero-engines to power and sustain the Sukhoi-30MKI jets was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Monday.

Prior to the meeting, the trio had a roadshow together in Sheo, travelling in the same vehicle, and received an overwhelming response.Roat, as an outsider to the region, gave a clear message to the major political parties of his ambitions beyond the contours of the tribal belt.Roat issued a stark warning to the BJP and Congress, stating that if they continue to neglect the political aspirations of tribals in the five desert districts—Barmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Pali—the Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) will rise as the primary political voice for these communities.He claimed at least 10 as-sembly seats in these districts should be reserved for STs, considering their populace.“The state govt has a responsibility to conduct a caste survey in the desert region and ensure that Scheduled Tribes (STs) receive their rightful share in jobs, educational institutions, and political representation,"" Roat asserted, accusing consecutive govts of deliberately downplaying the tribal population to suppress their influence.BAP, which has three MLAs from the Tribal Sub Plan Area in Southern Rajasthan, is eyeing this moment as an opportunity to extend its political reach into the desert region. “This is just the beginning. Get used to seeing me here often,” Roat confidently told the crowd, signalling his intention to establish a firm presence in the area.He also advocated for the creation of a separate religious code as a solution to the assimilation of STs into other castes like OBCs and SCs, and even into Christianity.In a conversation with TOI, Roat disclosed that his team is working on documenting tribal pockets in desert areas where people have acquired OBC and SC certificates, despite their original ST status. “Our first phase will focus on correcting these discrepancies to bring out the exact number of Tribals here which I bet will shock everyone,” he explained.Looking ahead, Roat outlined a multi-phase plan that includes a focus on improving education for Tribal children by tracking dropouts and pushing for the establishment of more schools in the region. ""The final phase involves launching a robust political movement before the next assembly elections. We aim to secure reserved electoral positions—Sarpanch, Gram Panchayat members, municipal and assembly seats—to ensure that Tribals have a strong voice in their own development,"" Roat concluded.A two-term MLA, Roat won from Banswara in a highly electrified contest against BJP heavyweight Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya, with support from the Congress.","Rajkumar Roat urged the Union govt to officially designate certain regions as Desert Tribal Areas (DTA) Roat issued a stark warning to the BJP and Congress, stating that if they continue to neglect the political aspirations of tribals, the Bharat Adivasi Party will rise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113002433,imgsize-320365,width-400,resizemode-4/113002433.jpg"
