The party also demanded a withdrawal of the tax on research grants.For the first time in history, a government is imposing a tax on grants received by research institutes, AAP general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak said at a press conference.The Modi government has issued a notice to all institutes, proposing to impose GST on research grants received since 2017, he said, adding that it was a double layer of taxation since a part of the grants is used on consumables and equipment that are already taxed.Research grants are not taxed in any developed or developing country such as the USA, the UK, Germany, South Korea or Singapore. Imposing GST on research being done for the development of mankind and the country is ""tax terrorism"", Pathak charged.The Rajya Sabha MP also lashed out at the government for ""stifling"" innovation and progress by taxing research meant for the nation's development and demanded it be withdrawn in the next meeting of the GST Council.A show-cause notice has been issued to all premier institutes that they will have to pay GST on all research grants they have received from 2017 till now. The government has demanded GST of around Rs 220 crore from these institutes, including IIT Delhi, Pathak said.""If the government does not withdraw this policy, AAP will raise its voice against this proposal on every appropriate forum and will make every possible effort to make the government withdraw it,"" he asserted.","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slammed the BJP-led central government over the imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on research grants.

Myanmar man

NEW DELHI: A Myanmar citizen, who was caught by the Assam Rifles in 2012 while crossing the international border and served six months' imprisonment under the Foreigners Act, has continued to languish in jail and a detention centre in Manipur without being deported. The Supreme Court has now decided to examine his plea for release and has sought a response from the Centre.The foreign national , who filed the petition through his advocate Gautam Jha, told the apex court that his identity had been verified by the Myanmarese authorities which was duly informed to their counterparts here. However, despite this he has been kept in the detention centre without being given any reason.He also informed the court that he was recognised and accepted as a refugee for resettlement to Canada by the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2021, and he could go there if released from detention.Observing that if the Canadian govt has no problem in taking him then why should the Centre object to it, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan sought the Indian govt 's response.""The perusal of page 76 of the writ petition would reveal that the High Commission of Canada has accepted the present petitioner as a refugee for resettlement to Canada. We request Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General, to take instructions as to what is the impediment for permitting the petitioner being sent to Canada, when the High Commission of Canada has approved the same,"" the court said.The petitioner Abdul Rashid , suspected as Bangladeshi national, was arrested in Feb 2012 while crossing the border and criminal proceedings were initiated against him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. The trial court convicted him and sentenced him to six months in jail which he had already undergone at the time of conviction.However, he continued to remain in Manipur jail . In Dec 2012, the state govt furnished his details to the ministry of external affairs for his deportation. As his deportation remained in limbo, the chief judicial magistrate had in Oct 2014 requested the state to expedite the deportation and verify the nationality of the petitioner with Myanmarese authorities after noting that his incarceration was beyond his term of imprisonment.With no progress in his case, Rashid approached Manipur High Court which had on Oct 24, 2016 directed that he be shifted out of jail and kept in a detention centre. As per the petitioner, Myanmarese authorities in 2022 verified his identity and told so to the Indian govt but he was still kept in detention centre for no reason disclosed to him.""The rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 22 are available to all persons who may or may not be citizens. The case of the petitioner must be treated at par with any other citizens in India. The law enforcement agencies should have ensured - legality, proportionality, and necessity for such unlawful detention. Insufficient guarantees in law to protect against arbitrary detention could call into question legal validity of any detention,"" he said.","A Myanmar citizen, who was caught by the Assam Rifles in 2012 while crossing the international border, has continued to languish in jail and a detention centre in Manipur.

NEW DELHI/PUNE: The central govt has sacked controversial IAS probationer Puja Manorama Khedkar from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), just over a month after the UPSC cancelled her provisional candidature for Civil Services Examination 2022 (CSE) for fraudulently availing of exam attempts more than the permissible limit by faking her identity.Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, allows the central govt to discharge an IAS probationer, after holding a summary enquiry, if it is satisfied that the probationer was ineligible for recruitment to the service or is unsuitable for being a member of the service.""Vide order dated 6th September, 2024 the Central Government discharges Ms Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar , IAS Probationer (MH:2023), from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) under Rule 12 of IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, with immediate effect,"" sources in the department of personnel and training (DoPT) informed TOI on Saturday.On July 31, the UPSC had cancelled Khedkar's candidature for CSE 2022, based on which she had been recommended to the IAS, on the ground that she had exceeded the nine CSE attempts permissible in her category - OBC and person with benchmark disability (PwBD) - by faking her identity. It had also permanently debarred her from all future examinations or selections of UPSC.As per findings of the single-member committee set up by DoPT on July 11 to probe the complaint referred to it by Maharashtra govt, particularly allegations that she may have misrepresented her caste and disability status, as well as UPSC's own inquiry, Khedkar had exhausted her maximum permissible attempts at CSE (nine for OBC and PwBD category) between 2012 And 2020 itself.It was concluded that Khedkar was ineligible to be a candidate for CSE-2022, which was the year of her selection and appointment to the lAS. Therefore, she was also ineligible to be recruited to the Indian Administrative Service, said an officer.TOI made repeated attempts to call Puja Khedkar and her father Dilip Khedkar, a retired senior Maharashtra govt officer, on Saturday to seek their comments on the development but their phones were switched off. Messages sent to them on the phone evoked no response till the time of going to press.Khedkar was served a show-cause notice on July 18 based on the findings and a criminal case filed against her for having forged her identity papers and misrepresenting facts to obtain extra attempts at CSE. After she failed to file her response despite an extended deadline till July 30, UPSC on July 31 announced its decision to cancel her candidature for CSE-2022 and also debarred her from appearing for any future selections or examinations conducted by it.The final nail in the coffin came on Friday, with the Centre sacking her from IAS with immediate effect for being ineligible for recruitment to the service.Khedkar's alleged lies as a CSE applicant about her as well as her parents' credentials, had recently led UPSC to prescribe Aadhaar authentication, though voluntary, of candidates appearing for all its examinations.As regards the complaints relating to the submission of false certificates (specifically OBC & PwBD categories) are concerned, the UPSC had clarified that it does only a preliminary scrutiny of the certificates viz. whether it was issued by the competent authority, the year to which the certificate pertains, issuing date of the certificate, whether there is any overwriting on the certificate, format of the certificate etc. Generally, the certificate is taken as genuine, if it has been issued by the competent authority, it had claimed.",Puja Manorama Khedkar has been sacked from the Indian Administrative Service.

Ganesh Fest: Ganesh Festival 2024: Toll-Free Rides on Maharashtra Highways from Sept 5-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ganesh-fest-toll-free-rides-on-major-hways-for-15-days/articleshow/113072955.cms,"MUMBAI: In what is seen as a move to avoid embarrassment over the condition of roads during Ganpati festival, the state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways across the state from Sept 5-19. But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too. Some officials acknowledged that with even these precautions, motorists could still be charged. ""If a FasTag sticker gets read and the toll gets deducted, one can make a cashback request through the FasTag bank account, following which the amount will be refunded,"" said a senior MSRDC official.The toll exemption directive covers all entry points of Mumbai (Vashi, Airoli, Mulund, LBS and Dahisar), barring Bandra-Worli Sea Link, NH-48 (Mumbai-Bengaluru), NH-66 (Mumbai-Goa), and other PWD and MSRDC roads. It applies to Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses as well, said a govt resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday, which said the move is targeted at devotees travelling during Ganesh festival. Samruddhi Mahamarg will also implement the GR, said officials. There was no clarity on whether MTHL is covered under the directive.Toll exemption passes will be issued to MSRTC buses with the vehicle number and driver's name. These will be coordinated by the transport department, traffic police, police and regional transport offices (RTO) and made available at police stations, traffic police checkpoints and RTO offices.

""It is 4.20pm now. This is very unfortunate,"" she said.The officer, who identified herself as an assistant investigating officer in the case, stepped out of the courtroom to make a call and returned after nearly 15 minutes to say that the lawyer was on his way.When Poria entered the courtroom at 5pm, defence lawyer Kavita Sarkar got up to question why CBI wasn't being represented by the counsel who attended the Aug 23 hearing.Poria replied that he was CBI's ""full-time lawyer"" and informed the court without citing any reason that the agency opposes Roy's bail plea. Magistrate Gupta remanded the rape-murder suspect, the lone person named in the FIR, in judicial custody till Sept 20.Defence lawyer Sarkar had argued for bail to Roy on the ground that he didn't have criminal antecedents or a criminal case pending against him.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's introduction to international cricket was characterized not only by his extraordinary talent but also by his fiery demeanor on the field. His fierce competitiveness, boldness, and refusal to back down from any confrontation—whether with opponents or spectators—quickly became defining traits.One of the most infamous incidents highlighting Virat's temperament occurred during India's 2012 tour of Australia, widely known as ""Virat's middle finger incident .""During the second Test in Sydney, while fielding near the boundary, Virat was repeatedly targeted by verbal abuse from a section of Australian fans.Aggravated by the continuous taunting, Virat responded by raising his middle finger toward the crowd.The gesture immediately caused controversy, drawing heavy criticism and substantial media attention.""I agree cricketers don't have to retaliate. What when the crowd says the worst things about your mother and sister. The worst I've heard,"" he had posted.The International Cricket Council (ICC) subsequently fined Virat 50% of his match fee for breaching the Code of Conduct, citing unsportsmanlike behavior.In an interview with Wisden, Virat opened up on the controversy and recalled how he pleaded with the match referee Ranjan Madugalle to not ban him.""Yeah, the one thing I remember most is when I'd had enough of the Australian crowd at Sydney and I just decided to flick a finger at them.

LUCKNOW: Bowing to BJP pressure, ally Rashtriya Lok Dal has backed down from its demand to contest the Haryana assembly elections . The development shows BJP's upper hand over allies in the upcoming assembly polls in many states.Sources in RLD confirmed that the party had been demanding at least two seats in Haryana after joining the BJP-led NDA before the Lok Sabha polls.RLD, whose politics is mainly centred around farmers and Jats of western UP, was keen to enter Haryana to expand its presence given the sizable numbers of Jats and agricultural community there. Haryana goes to polls on Oct 5.Sources said RLD has also offered to give up its claim to contest from Meerapur assembly seat of UP, where a bypoll is due following the election of incumbent MLA Chandan Chauhan to Lok Sabha from Bijnor.In 2019 too, BJP had contested on all 90 assembly seats in Haryana and won 40 seats with 36.49% vote share.Experts said Jayant Chaudhary backing down on demand shows BJP's strategy to keep smaller allies like RLD in a 'subordinate role' in key elections, thus keeping the alliance structure favourable to the larger party's interests. ""This also seems to be part of the BJP's broader strategy to consolidate its political power in the region after losses in the Lok Sabha elections,"" said a political commentator.Significantly, Jayant, during his alliance with SP and Congress, had come in open support of the wrestlers who were protesting against former WFI chief and the then BJP MP Braj Bhushan Sharan Singh who has been accused of sexual harassment. Haryana decision is, however, in contrast to RLD's move to contest at least 10 seats in Jammu and Kashmir. RLD sources said that the decision to contest assembly elections in J&K was part of a larger strategy to keep up the electoral identity.Political experts said the dual approach—maintaining a strategic alliance in key states like UP while asserting independence in others—marks RLD's attempt to navigate the political landscape while protecting its core interests.RLD national general secretary (organisation) Trilok Tyagi said their alliance with BJP is mainly restricted to UP. ""In other states, we are taking decisions after considering our electoral requirements. Nevertheless, we need to strategise jointly and in cohesion with our alliance partners,"" he told TOI.RLD had earlier contested gram panchayat elections in J&K.Meanwhile, RLD has intensified its discussions with BJP to contest assembly elections in Jharkhand and Maharashtra.

Having stayed in a hostel on campus, she had been commuting from her home, on the outskirts of Kolkata and about 14km north of RG Kar hospital, for over a year.Colleagues recalled her as being her usual busy, focused self, with nothing out of the ordinary. ""The OPD was bustling with patients when she entered the hospital and got busy right away. She admitted six patients and had no time for a break except to snatch a few moments to have some tea,"" said a colleague.Assigned to unit 2A of the department, her team in the OPD included a resident medical officer, a senior resident doctor, a faculty member, as well as interns and house staff.

Her team had ordered lunch, and since she was late, they kept her food aside.""She came in after 3pm and had her food in the 'sleep room' next door where we usually eat. She was a little reserved but very focused. A senior faculty member and I left around 4.30pm after telling her to call if any patient's condition deteriorated. The call never came and the next morning I learned of her gruesome death,"" said a third-year trainee doctor.After a late lunch, she hurried to take charge of patients in her unit. The 80-bed department on the third floor of the Emergency Building has six units, and this was to be her place of work until another PG trainee doctor relieved her late on Aug 9.""Didi was dashing to the ward when I bumped into her in the corridor.

SHIMLA: Two days after a massive protest was organised to demand demolition of an alleged unauthorised mosque, the state waqf board on Saturday claimed the mosque 's legal ownership before the Shimla municipal commissioner's court.After hearing both sides, the municipal commissioner's court posted the case for next hearing on October 5. Waqf board's estate officer Kutubuddin Ahmed told mediapersons later that the dispute does not pertain to the ownership of the mosque or its land, but about its further construction.As per records, the waqf board became the owner of the land on which the mosque was constructed when Shimla was part of undivided Punjab, he claimed. Appearing for local residents, advocate Jagat Pal told reporters later that the court has sought a status report on the construction of the disputed religious building.He added that local people were forced to join the issue as it had been lingering in the municipal commissioner's court for the past 14 years.

He informed that the municipal commissioner court had issued notice to the waqf board last year, to which the reply was submitted during the last hearing.But another summons was issued after that, to which the Board submitted its reply through its advocate on Saturday, added Ahmed.The issue of the legality of the mosque had flared up after last week's altercation in Malyana area, when a man from the majority community had slapped a barber from the minority community, who then called his friends, resulting in a fight.","State waqf board on Saturday claimed the mosque's legal ownership before the Shimla municipal commissioner's court.

SRINAGAR:

National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah accused BJP Saturday of “striking secret deals” with some regional parties and Independents to form a govt in J&K after the Sept 18 to Oct 1 asssembly polls.NC has forged an alliance with Congress for the polls to the 90 assembly seats. Addressing a rally in Ganderbal assembly segment from where he is contesting, Omar referred to remarks by Amit Shah in Jammu, claiming the Union home minister was “silent” on Apni Party and People’s Conference during his speech at BJP’s manifesto launch on Friday.“Those who have struck a deal with Delhi will not fulfill your demands. If you need evidence, just look at the statement of Shah. The home minister listed the parties with which BJP will not form the govt. He was, however, silent about Independents because they are hand in glove (with them). He was silent on Apni Party and People’s Conference,” Omar said.The former CM even sought to cast doubts on Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by jailed MP Engineer Rashid who had defeated Omar in the Baramulla seat in this summer’s Lok Sabha polls. Omar pointed out that Shah had not included AIP among the parties with which BJP would have no truck. “I thought he (Shah) would at least name the party of Engineer Rashid but he did not,” Omar told the rally.Omar’s remarks came on a day both Rasheed’s AIP and the Sajad Lone-led People’s Conference unveiled their manifestos.People’s Conference promised to continue fighting for restoration of J&K’s special status under Article 370 and statehood by supporting “efforts within and outside legislative forums”. Another key element was a pledge for a judicial commission to probe alleged rigging in the 1987 assembly polls when NC was in office. The rigging-marred elections were widely believed to have ignited militancy in J&K the next few years.Rasheed’s AIP vowed release of all jailed Valley youths and efforts to revoke laws like Public Safety Act (PSA) and UAPA. Most of the youths have been jailed under the two stringent acts. Another key AIP promise was to restore the Darbar Move under which J&K had two capitals earlier --- Jammu in winter and Srinagar in summer. The decades-old practice was stopped after the Aug 2019 abrogation of special status.","NC has forged an alliance with Congress for the polls to the 90 assembly seats.

Rahul said, ""When I started this journey, I said love will conquer hate and hope will defeat fear, today our mission remains the same."" Kharge on X said, ""On the occasion... I only appeal to the countrymen to continue the struggle to preserve the Constitution and democracy.""Down and out since 2014 in the face of a polarisation-powered BJP, the yatra is widely viewed in Congress and outside as having given a new paradigm for the opposition to take on the ruling party. The boldness to confront BJP on the issue of polarisation and ""threat to Constitution"", shedding widespread in-house concerns of a backlash, emerged from the yatra, which then became unexpected weapons in denting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2024.The praise for BJY on its anniversary was lavish. While Congress general secretary KC Venugopal called it the ""single most impactful political phenomenon of the last decade"", party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, ""It heralded a change in the politics of our country."" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, ""BJY is a mission of Rahul Gandhi to unite the country - which is continuing even today.""According to Ramesh, the yatra resulted in the ""emergence of real Rahul Gandhi"", even as it ""mobilised a somewhat downbeat organisation"". He said, ""it succeeded in the messaging of key themes - inequalities, polarisation and tanashahi (dictatorship).""Congress members assert that the yatra has continued since, in the form of Rahul's intermittent meetings with workers across occupation groups, from artisans to rail pilots. Rahul said it taught him ""the beauty of silence"", with the power to tune out the noise and listen to the person next to him, as he did during his 145 days footmarch.Awaited now is 'Bharat Dojo Yatra', that Rahul recently announced while sharing a video of martial arts sessions held at campsites of BJY, and explaining 'Dojo' as a training site.","The 4,000 km padyatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir started on Sept 7, 2022, which then led to East to West Yatra in 2024 ahead of the elections.
