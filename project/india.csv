HATHRASUP police on Wednesday registered an FIR in the Hathras stampede tragedy, naming ‘mukhya sevadar’ (chief volunteer) Devprakash Madhukar and other organisers of the religious congregation, but not mentioning the central conductor of the event, ‘Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba’, formerly known as Surajpal Singh.The FIR stated that the organisers “underreported the number of expected attendees, did not cooperate in managing traffic, and concealed evidence after the stampede, which occurred when people stopped to collect soil from the path of the baba’s vehicle.” The FIR indicated that the police and administration did everything possible with available resources.Filed at the Sikandra Rau police station, the FIR cited sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including “culpable homicide not amounting to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, wrongful restraint, disobedience to a public servant’s order, and causing the disappearance of evidence.”Sub-inspector Brijesh Pandey, the complainant, said Madhukar and others organised the ‘ satsang ’ held between Fulrai and Mugalgarhi villages on G T Road in Sikandra Rau. They sought permission for about 80,000 attendees, but over 2.5 lakh people converged for the event, leading to severe traffic jams. Video clips circulating on social media platforms showed a large crowd listening to the baba seated on a throne.Eyewitnesses said that after the satsang, many devotees rushed to the exit while others moved in the opposite direction to collect soil, causing a deadly crowd build-up. “On the other side of the road, the crowd running in the field filled with ‘keechad’ (sludge) behind the baba’s car was forcibly stopped by the organising committee with sticks, increasing the pressure and resulting in people being crushed,” the FIR stated.Despite the chaos, police and administration officials managed to transport the injured to hospitals using all resources available, the FIR said, adding that the organisers and volunteers did not cooperate.When asked about potential arrests, UP chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh said, “The ambit of the investigation is open.”“Right now, everything is a matter of investigation,” the chief secretary added. “We do not want to influence the investigation by drawing any immediate conclusion. Action will be taken based on the facts that come to light during the probe.”","FIR names Devprakash Madhukar and other organisers of religious congregation.

This led to the northeast MPs' protest.""Shinde said the PM will not be given free passage in future also, and he will have to give respect to the opposition and show sensitivity, adding that he is responsible for the atrocities in Manipur and cannot escape accountability.After walking out of Rajya Sabha in protest against the PM's comments and the chair's refusal to give him a chance to clarify on Wednesday, Kharge said on X that in an editorial in Organiser magazine in 1949, RSS gave vent to its ideas regarding Manusmriti, saying ""in our Constitution, there is no mention of the unique constitutional developments in ancient Bharat. Manu's laws were written long before Lycurgus of Sparta or Solon of Persia. To this day laws as enunciated in the Manusmriti excite the admiration of the world and elicit spontaneous obedience and conformity. But to our constitutional pundits (read Ambedkar) that means nothing."" Kharge added RSS had protested against Ambedkar and Nehru.In contrast, Kharge said, Ambedkar had lavished praise on Congress for making him chairman of the Constitution drafting committee, ""despite more capable persons present in the constituent assembly for the job"" and had stated that Congress deserved the credit for the drafting of the Constitution.""Modi calls us opposed to Constitution and Ambedkar when history says that BJP, Jan Sangh and RSS are born opponents of the Constitution and Ambedkar,"" Kharge said outside Parliament, flanked by Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and the entire opposition bloc.The Congress president said he repeatedly sought permission from the Chair to clarify these facts in Rajya Sabha but was not given a chance, while the PM had himself intervened along with many ministers during Rahul Gandhi's speech in Lok Sabha.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge slams PM Narendra Modi for attacking Congress on Constitution and Ambedkar.

Tamil Nadu's Unique Education Strategy: SEP vs NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-walks-its-own-path-on-education/articleshow/111420430.cms,"The State Education Policy (SEP) looks set to have several student-friendly provisions -from only play at pre-primary schools to open book assessment to no common exams till Class X. A 550-page set of recommendations on the SEP was submitted by a 14-member panel headed by Justice D Murugesan, retired chief justice of Delhi high court, to chief minister M K Stalin on Monday.The Murugesan panel report runs counter to the National Education Policy (NEP). It favours continuing with the existing school education system instead of the 5+3+3+4 system proposed by NEP. It recommends five years as entry age for Class I against six years by NEP. UG admissions should be based on Class XI and XII board exam marks and not an entrance test as proposed by NEP. There are to be no multiple entry and exits in degree programmes. The panel also proposed a two-language formula against the three-language formula suggested by NEP.“Tamil Nadu has been following five years as a school entry for several years and it served the state well. We have recommended regulations to make school entry age uniform for all types of schools in the state,” Justice Murugesan told TOI.The report also recommends steps to check commercialisation of education, a ban on coaching and tuition centres parallel to schools and colleges, longer periods for physical education, and a special mission to improve quality of higher education.“Conducting common exams at early classes such as Class III and V or VIII will add stress to students. So, we have recommended board exams only in Class X,” Murugesan said.The panel proposed a regulatory body for deemed-to-be universities for admissions, fee structures and minimum salary for faculty. It recommended extending oversight by the state board fee committee to schools that fol low CBSE and other boards too.Revamping teacher selection and education, setting up regional structures for affiliating engineering colleges and establishing super specialty hospitals and college under Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University were other recommendations.It proposes RTE admission reimbursement only in private schools located in remote areas, hills, where there are no govt schools. It says funds being spent for RTE admissions can be used for developing govt schools.“The present structure offers seamless transition from school to college to students. NEP may disrupt the transition as it mandates a common entrance test and introduces a new school education system. In hindsight, the recommendations seem to protect the interests of people of TN and educational infrastructure in the state,” said education activist P B Prince Gajendrababu.Madras University former vice-chancellor P Duraisamy said multiple entry and exits in degree programmes will offer flexibility to students.",A 550-page set of recommendations on the SEP was submitted by a 14-member panel to chief minister M K Stalin on Monday.

NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks. The change was accepted by Supreme Court .The official statement on Monday read: ""Pursuant to the Order ... a Re-Test was held for 1,563 candidates on 23 June 2024 ..., out of which a total of 813 candidates appeared therein,"" adding, ""It is now informed that revised Score Cards of all Candidates of NEET (UG) 2024 (including of 1,563 Candidates who appeared in the Re-Test on 23 June 2024), are being hosted on the website...""Chandigarh, which had just two candidates registered, saw zero attendance. The Jhajjar centre, which was under scrutiny, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the test.The NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres, saw a little over 23 lakh of the 24 lakh candidates taking the exam. 67 students initially scored a perfect 720, an unprecedented number in NEET's history, with six from one centre in Haryana, raising suspicions of irregularities and the role of grace marks.The NEET-UG exam, conducted by the NTA, is for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in govt and private institutions across India.The agency is currently under scrutiny for alleged irregularities in the exam, including a paper leak, with various groups calling for a retest.","60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score.

He cited the statement by the father of Agniveer martyr Ajay Singh, who said that despite Singh's claims, his family had not received the promised compensation.""Rahul Gandhi is raising our voice in Parliament that families of martyrs must get all necessary help.

Change of guard in Jharkhand: Why Hemant Soren has moved fast to return as chief minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-of-guard-in-jharkhand-why-hemant-soren-has-moved-fast-to-return-as-chief-minister/articleshow/111466589.cms,"So, what was the hurry?

Why Jharkhand assembly elections are important for INDIA bloc?

JMM ahead in number games

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for JMM executive president Hemant Soren to return as Jharkhand chief minister ahead of assembly elections due in the state later this year. Champai Soren, an old party loyalist, who had taken over the reins of the state five months back after Hemant was arrested by ED in an alleged money laundering case, stepped down on Wednesday.In fact, there were indications of a change of guard in the state on Tuesday itself when all public programmes of Champai Soren had been cancelled.The sudden, though expected, move comes after JMM's allies - the Congress and the RJD - unanimously endorsed the return of Hemant Soren as the head of the ruling INDIA bloc. This despite the fact that the leadership change provides the BJP ammunition to paint the JMM as a family-oriented party. The BJP has slammed JMM for removing a senior tribal leader from the top post to pave way for the return of Hemant, who is the son of former Union minister Shibu Soren. Jharkhand BJP chief Babulal Marandi said the real face of JMM, which had talked about rising above nepotism and electing a new chief minister five months ago, has once again been exposed.Hemant Soren was granted bail by high court on June 28 and in less than a week he has set the stage for his return as the chief minister. Why did Hemant move fast to reclaim the top post?The ED case against Hemant Soren is still on and the probe agency has indicated that it will challenge the high court order granting relief to the JMM leader. News agency PTI, quoting sources, has reported that ED will file a SLP (Special Leave Petition) in the Supreme Court against the June 28 order passed by the single bench of Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay of Jharkhand high court. The high court order not only granted him bail but also said “there was reason to believ"" that Soren was not guilty of the offence as alleged by the ED and there was no likelihood of the petitioner committing a similar offence.” Clearly, Soren wants to make a move before the probe agency plays the spoilsport.While Champai Soren has been an old party loyalist, the truth remains that he was perhaps not the first choice as Hemant's replacement. For the party that has never given the top post to anyone outside the family, appointing Champai was a compulsion at that point in time. Hemant's wife Kalpana, whose name then emerged as a strong contender for the top job, was not an MLA and did not have any political experience. Moreover, Shibu Soren, who had to decide on the replacement, also faced the dilemma of ignoring the political claims of his senior bahu Sita Soren, who has since left the party and is now with the BJP.However, things have changed in the last five months. Kalpana has established herself as a leader - leading the JMM Lok Sabha campaign effectively in the absence of Hemant Soren and improving the party's tally in the Lower House. If Hemant has to step down again, Kalpana would now be the natural choice for replacement. However, for that to happen, Hemant has to be in the saddle first.In fact, Kalpana's takeover may not be needed at all. In case of any such eventuality, Hemant Soren can follow into the footsteps of Delhi chief minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who has set the precedent of continuing as chief minister despite being in jail.Jharkhand goes to elections in four to five months and Hemant Soren would want to be the face of INDIA bloc in the state polls after missing out on most part of the Lok Sabha campaign following his arrest on January 31.In his first public rally after release from jail, Hemant Soren claimed that the BJP is planning to advance assembly elections in Jharkhand. Hemant Soren, who has accused the BJP of hatching a conspiracy to send him to jail, will now claim vindication of his stand of being innocent and the saffron party of being ""anti-Tribal"".JMM would be upbeat with the results of Lok Sabha elections. The party won three seats - Rajmahal, Dumka and Singhbhum, which is a gain of two seats from the 2019 elections. The party would hope to build on this success to make further gains in the assembly elections and consolidate the INDIA bloc against the BJP-led NDA.Unlike Maharashtra and Haryana, the two other NDA-ruled states which go to polls later this year, in Jharkhand the INDIA bloc has to defend its government. Clearly, the JMM-led ruling combine will have to fight anti-incumbency to retain power in Jharkhand.Five years back, the JMM despite performing poorly in Lok Sabha elections, did well in the assembly elections by unseating the BJP government of Raghubar Das.Hemant Soren has staked claim to form the next government and would be waiting for governor's invite to become chief minister of the state for the third time. The JMM-led alliance enjoys majority in the state assembly despite its numbers reducing to 45 MLAs – JMM-27, Congress-17 and RJD-1 after the Lok Sabha elections.Two JMM MLAs, Nalin Soren and Joba Majhi, are now parliamentarians, while Jama legislator Sita Soren resigned to contest the general elections on a BJP ticket. The JMM expelled two more legislators – Bishunpur MLA Chamra Linda and Boriyo MLA Lobin Hembrom – from the party.Likewise, the BJP's strength in the assembly has reduced to 24, as two of its MLAs – Dhulu Mahto (Baghmara) and Manish Jaiswal (Hazaribag) – are now MPs. The saffron party has expelled Mandu MLA Jaiprakash Bhai Patel after he joined the Congress to contest the polls.The current strength of the 81-member Jharkhand assembly is 76.(With inputs from agencies)","Champai Soren, an old party loyalist, who had taken over the reins of the state five months back after Hemant was arrested by ED, stepped down on Wednesday. The ED case against Hemant Soren is still on and the probe agency has indicated that it will challenge the high court order granting relief to the JMM leader.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111466470,imgsize-347314,width-400,resizemode-4/111466470.jpg"
"Opposition lacks courage to hear the truth, running away: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-lacks-courage-to-hear-the-truth-running-away-pm-modi/articleshow/111468720.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday escalated his counter-offensive against the opposition and asserted that if the Lok Sabha polls were indeed a referendum on protection of the Constitution , then people considered NDA as more suitable for the job and said his opponents lacked the strength and courage to accept the fact of their defeat.As opposition members walked out during his reply to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, the PM said, “The country is watching.People who spread lies have no strength to hear the truth. They don’t have the courage to face the truth. They don’t even have the courage to listen to the replies to questions they raised during the discussion and can only run away. They are insulting the upper House and insulting its tradition.”Modi said the opposition had been defeated so convincingly that they had no option but to shout slogans on the streets. “Sloganeering, shouting and running away from the field are their destiny,” he said.The opposition walked out as Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not concede their demand to allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to intervene when the PM was speaking.Dhankhar lashed out at opposition MPs and Kharge and said he had given the LoP adequate time to speak without interruption. “Today, they did not leave the House, they left their dignity. Today, they did not show me their back, they showed it to the Constitution,” he said. Condemning their behaviour, Dhankhar said there could not be a greater insult to the Constitution than this.During the entire discussion on the President’s address, Constitution took the centrestage with both opposition and treasury benches raising the issue.Modi said the recent LS polls were not the first in which Constitution was in play. “Let me remind them that in the election of 1977, the only issue was to reinstate democracy and protect Constitution. That was the biggest election for protection of Constitution and people defeated the then govt. If this time it was an election to protect the Constitution, people have found us as able for that task and people have voted for us,” he said.The PM accused Congress of hypocrisy by recalling the 38th, 39th and 42nd amendments to the Constitution which sought to change the statute radically . He emphasised that through amendments Congress had sought to extend the term of Lok Sabha. ""You were elected in 1971 for five years but went on to occupy office until March 1977. Was that constitutional?"" he asked. Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council during the 10 years of UPA govt, Modi said this entity was placed over the PM. “Was it a constitutional post? You destroyed the office of PM. You remote controlled it,” he said.Modi also charged the Congress with putting “one family above all”, including the holders of constitutional offices.",The opposition walked out as Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not concede their demand to allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to intervene when the PM was speaking.

SC slams Manipur HC for denying medical aid to tribal prisoner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-slams-manipur-hc-for-denying-medical-aid-to-tribal-prisoner/articleshow/111471840.cms,"NEW DELHI:

Supreme Court on Wednesday strongly disapproved Manipur HC ’s refusal to allow an ailing undertrial tribal person, arrested in Oct 2022 for possessing two kilograms of brown sugar, to be treated outside the prison because of simmering ethnic clashes .While ordering immediate shifting of Lunkhongjam Haokip to Gauhati Medical College & Hospital for treatment, a vacation bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Ujjal Bhuyan was critical of HC’s Feb 29, 2024 order declining shifting of the prisoner outside the jail as he belonged to a tribal community as it could be hazardous given the law and order situation.Manipur witnessed clashes last year, to curb which even SC had to intervene. Over 200 persons lost their lives and many were left injured and homeless. While clashes have subsided, the tension — which burst open after HC asked the state govt to respond to a 10-year-old letter from the Centre on tribal status of an ethnic group — continues to simmer. Frowning at HC’s order and state’s lackadaisical approach, the SC bench told Manipur counsel Pukhrambam Ramesh, “We could have observed many things regarding state and HC. But we refrain from doing so for now.”The bench found that the accused was examined in jail by a medical officer as he was suffering from piles, TB, chronic tonsillitis, abdominal pain as well as problems in his lower lumbar spine. “If medical report reveals anything serious, we will take state to task. He may be a criminal, might have committed a serious crime, but state has obligation to provide him medical treatment ,” it said.","Supreme Court disapproves Manipur HC’s refusal to allow an ailing undertrial tribal person to be treated outside the prison.

"Rishi Shah: This Indian-American ex-billionaire frauded Google, Goldman; gets 7.5-year sentence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-indian-american-ex-billionaire-frauded-google-goldman-gets-7-5-year-sentence/articleshow/111413566.cms,"'Ashamed and embarrassed'

38-year-old Rishi Shah co-founded Outcome Health , a startup that provided advertisement on TVs in doctors' offices. His investors included Goldman Sachs Group, Goggle parent Alphabet etc making him a billionaire in Chicago, but it was all a fraud as the company sold more ads that it could broadcast and lied to clients like pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S about the size of its network of TV in doctors' offices, Bloomberg reported.Shah was convicted in April 2023 along with company president and co-founder Shradha Agarwal and CFO Brad Purdy.In 2017, the fraud came to light after the investors sued Shah's Outcome claiming fraud tied to a a $487.5 million fundraising that year that led to a $225 million dividend pocketed by Shah and Agarwal.Rishi Shah told the court that he was ashamed and embarrassed by his failure to properly manage the company's aggressive push for growth and that led to many ""fatal mistakes"" including not tracking the delivery of the ads paid for by the clients. “The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to client questions,” he said in the statement.Rishi Shah ideated his company in 2006 when he was a student at Northwestern University in Chicago. As the company expanded, his public profile grew and he became a budding star in Democratic circles. A son of a doctor, Rishi dropped out of the university to start this company.Shah and his associates, meanwhile, were leading a lavish lifestyle featuring private aircraft and yachts.","38-year-old Rishi Shah co-founded Outcome Health, a startup that provided advertisement on TVs in doctors' offices.

50k doses of semen & counting: Meet UP’s elite breeder bull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/50k-doses-of-semen-counting-meet-ups-elite-breeder-bull/articleshow/111374226.cms,"Having contributed over 50,000 doses of semen , Gorakh, the lone Gangatiri bull at the Uttar Pradesh government’s Hapur farm, has emerged a pioneer in the conservation and propagation of high quality Gangatiri germplasm in UP .Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost.A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk every day.The genetically improved breed, however, may have a higher yield. The breed was registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in 2015.Born on Jan 29, 2014, Gorakh has his parentage verified and that’s what made him qualify as the donor for production of sexed semen (in which 90% Y chromosomes are removed) for Gangatiri breed of cows in the state. The two female Gangatiri calves, which were born at the govt’s Varanasi farm on March 26 and March 27, using embryo transfer technology and IVF for Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, are Gorakh’s progenies. The bull produces over 2200 doses of semen every month.Having a specific ID number, 287020, Gorakh will go strong for at least three more years, says his record. He was born at a gaushala in Mirzapur to Rahu and Pinki, both of whom were elite cows themselves. His induction at the Hapur farm took place in Jan 2015, when he was only a year old. His training for semen collection programme started in August 2019 and two months later, the farm started collecting his semen.Considering that bulls become sexually productive mostly by age of three and may go on to be productive for minimum for up to eight years of age and maximum for up to 15 years or even 18 years, as has been seen in a few cases, Gorakh may have a lot left in him still to give to the programme that he is already contributing to, especially when his record says that he is a bull with good libido and good quality semen.As far as his temperament is concerned, his keepers call him gentle. If Gorakh has been able to donate over 50,000 doses of semen till now, it’s because he has been on a herbal libido enhancer and a balanced diet. His daily diet comprises 7.5 kg of balanced concentrate with 12 kg dry fodder and premix of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. His exercise regimen is also strict and regular to keep him healthy and fit. The farm spends around Rs30,000 on his upkeep every month.It is a tough scan that a bull goes through to qualify as a sperm donor. The first stage is rearing. Many bulls get ousted at this very stage as they may not match the physical standards, or their sperm concentration may be low. The second is the training stage, where the bulls are trained to ejaculate with dummy partners present around to stimulate them. It is the final stage, the collection stage, in which the bull starts donating sperm.There are standards defined for the collection stage as well. The sperm count should be at least 500million per ml of semen for the bull to qualify as the donor. Each ejaculation gives 3-4ml of semen. Gorakh may have already matched the minimum standards to emerge as the pioneer sperm donor for Gangatiri cows. At present, he is the only male contributor to the programme. Officials said that there was one more male, but he died a few years ago.Dr Neeraj Gupta, CEO, UP Livestock Development Board, said, “There are norms defined for every stage. Each stage is monitored by experts. The collection is done scientifically and under the supervision of the experts.”The dummy partners for Gorakh are other male bulls, who are given an artificial vagina, which has a standard temperature of 37 degrees C to provide natural warmth to the male during ejaculation. Gorakh would mount the dummy partners each time he issexually stimulated. The process is done in the presence of experts and it has to be a swift collection of semen. The sperm is flushed twice a week, if done more, the semen quality might deteriorate. Every time the semen is flushed, it gives at least 200 doses, which is 400 doses in a week. Going by the standards, 2 lakh doses of semen may be taken from a bull in its lifetime.Gorakh is ten years but fit to go long. When embryo transfer technology (ETT) and IVF were used to produce Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, at UP’s Varanasi farm, in July-August 2023, four elite females at the farm were selected as the egg donors, after their records of lactation and parentage were verified. The sexed semen from Gorakh was used to fertilize the eggs in-vivo (inside the body).Later, after about seven days, the embryos were flushed from the donor cows and transferred into four recipient cows, who may not have been of high merit for being merely the surrogate. At the end, because only two pregnancies were successful, two calves were born.The ETT is being extensively used for improvement of indigenous cow breeds at various places as elite cows are used as egg and sperm donors. The standard gestation period for cows is over nine months. Going by that standard, one female may produce one calf in a year, mostly. Through ETT, an elite cow can produce multiple progenies in a year. Ravinder, principal secretary, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, said, “In the current booming era of Artificial Intelligence, future strategy and better planning on artificial insemination (AI) will bring significant improvement in the entire livestock herd and reduce the risk of financial insecurity of farmers from unpredictable loss of agriculture returns. In the near future, the calf born through AI with elite genetics is going to pay a premium to farmers as predictive analytics can be made much before the progeny comes into production.”","Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar.
