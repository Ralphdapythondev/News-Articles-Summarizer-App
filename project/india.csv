How can we forget the Corona period? Our country administered vaccines to crores of people the fastest of all, across the world. This is the same country where terrorists used to come and attack us. When the armed forces of the country execute surgical strike, when it does airstrike, the youth of the country are filled with pride.

Goods exports decline for 1st time in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goods-exports-decline-for-1st-time-in-4-months/articleshow/112535970.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's trade deficit widened to $23.5 billion in July as exports dipped marginally to $34 billion, while imports rose 7.5% to $57.5 billion due to a sharp rise in oil shipments. The 1.4% decline in exports during July was the first since March, the sharpest since last Nov, and was driven by a fall in the export of petrol and diesel (-22%) as well as gems and jewellery (-20%).In contrast, on the import front, crude soared over 17% to $13.9 billion during the month.Gold imports fell 10.7% to $3.1 billion. ""Our exports are holding up despite what is happening globally... Monthly fluctuations in exports are largely impacted by crude oil prices,"" commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters.He argued that apart from prices, high demand for oil products in India also played a part in lower shipments from the country, while on the import side, with the Indian economy growing at over 7%, there was good demand for crude.Barthwal said that going by the current trend, the country's exports of goods and services will cross last year's level of $778 billion.The commerce secretary played down concerns over trade disruption with Bangladesh and said that the impact so far was only for a limited period. ""We are monitoring trade across the border, disruptions have largely been addressed. There should be improvement in trade and whatever best efforts are required will be taken,"" he said.While the trade deficit with China has widened, the commerce secretary said that in several segments, such as electronics, there was increase in imports of components. ""We are looking at sectors where value addition will improve. It is important to see how much value is being added here,"" he said, adding that imports were rising also because India was becoming part of the global value chain.The commerce department is also pitching for an extension of the interest equalisation scheme and RoDTEP, a duty refund scheme for exporters, and a decision will be taken soon, DGFT Santosh Sarangi told reporters.","India's trade deficit widened to $23.5 billion in July as exports dipped marginally to $34 billion.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

Rape And Murder: Fresh Allegations Arise in R G Kar Hospital Rape Case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fresh-allegations-arise-in-r-g-kar-hospital-rape-case/articleshow/112479152.cms,"KOLKATA: A viral audio that is being shared over social media and instant messaging platforms since Sunday night has raised fresh questions about who else may be involved in the brutal rape and murder of the second year PGT doctor at R G Kar Hospital early on Friday.TOI, however, couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the contents of the audio.While cops arrested a 35-year-old civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , in less than 24 hours after the crime came to light and stressed that only one person was responsible, the viral audio — purportedly a phone conversation between an intern of the same hospital and a PGT doctor of another hospital — has raised fresh concerns.The conversation in the audio starts with the PGT asking the intern to tell him the real story behind whatever has come up in the public forum in this case, to which the intern says the whole movement is staged and is apparently controlled by the principal and his subordinates.“It feels good that outsiders are doing so much depending on us. But, we are not sustainable by ourselves. He (Sanjay Roy) has been made a scapegoat. With that the authorities wanted us to forget it. But, they don’t know that IQ is there, that it is not possible for him to do,” the intern is heard saying.The intern goes on to say that the post-mortem report shows that the injuries on the woman are not the work of one person but at least two or three, to which the PGT asks: “Who could it be?

Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train to feature Thane Creek's undersea engineering marvel

India's first bullet train, set to run by 2028, will pass under Thane Creek via a complex 7km undersea tunnel between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The project involves the use of advanced tunnel boring machines due to unique geological challenges. Excavation has started at multiple sites, with the overall corridor expected to be completed by the end of 2028.

AHMEDABAD: The first Vande Bharat metro train has arrived in Ahmedabad for official launch from Gandhinagar. The train is likely to run between Gandhinagar and Bhuj and will replace the local train. Another proposal is to run it between Surat and Gandhinagar. However, there is an intercity train — the Jamnagar-Ahmedabad-Surat intercity — already operational on the Surat route.This new metro train will be completely airconditioned and have the same facilities as Vande Bharat Express. Officials said that Vande Bharat metro’s schedule, destination and the day it will be flagged off are yet to be announced. There is a possibility of it being launched on Independence Day.Railways has also announced a Rakshabandhan special, the Bandra-Ahmedabad-Bandra superfast.

Trinamool MP Abhishek condemns the violence

BJP Leader Suvendu Adhikari alleges TMC involvement

Nationwide protests and CBI probe

In the early hours of Thursday morning, chaos erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after a group of miscreants broke through barricades, manhandled protesting doctors, and damaged hospital property, including the emergency building where the body of a woman doctor was found last week, according to police reports.The incident occurred during midnight protests by women outraged over the horrific rape and murder of the doctor at the hospital.The vandalism took place as 'Reclaim the Nights' protest rallies—organized to demand justice for the brutal rape and murder of a young PGT doctor—converged at the hospital from various parts of the city.Police reported that a group of nearly 40 people, allegedly disguised as protesters, entered the hospital premises, vandalized property, and pelted stones at police officers, prompting the police to fire teargas to disperse the mob. Emergency beds occupied by patients were also vandalized, forcing doctors, nurses, and police officers to flee. The intruders, who were dressed in shorts and vests, were not part of the initial rallies.In addition to the damage to the hospital, a police vehicle and several two-wheelers were also vandalized, with some police officers injured in the violence.The 'Reclaim the Night' campaign, which gained momentum through social media, began at 11:55 pm, coinciding with Independence Day celebrations, and spread across key areas in both small towns and big cities, including several landmarks in Kolkata.As tensions escalated, Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal arrived at the scene around 2 am and criticized the media for what he called a malicious campaign against the police.Commissioner Goyal defended the actions of the Kolkata Police, saying they had left no stone unturned in the investigation. He asserted that even the CBI would not be able to prove that the police were trying to shield anyone.""What has happened here is the result of a wrong media campaign, a malicious campaign against Kolkata police. What has Kolkata police not done? We have done everything in this case... We have tried to satisfy the family, but rumors are being spread... I am extremely angry. We have not done anything wrong. Because of this malicious campaign, Kolkata police have lost the trust of the people. We have never claimed that there is only one suspect; we are waiting for scientific evidence, and it takes time... I can't arrest a young PG student based on rumors—it's against my conscience. There is immense pressure from the media, but we have acted appropriately. Now, the CBI is investigating. They'll conduct a fair probe, and we will fully support them... False propaganda is circulating that bones are broken, this is done, that is done, but unfortunately, it's not supported by scientific evidence,"" Goyal said.He further said, ""Please don't spread the rumours. We are verifying everything... We are constantly interrogating everyone who was there. On the first night, the additional CP was here and he had interrogated everyone personally. Just by rumour-mongering and bringing distrust to the citizens, I think this city is the loser, not Vineet Goyal... You must ask CBI, the kind of work the officers have done in the span of these four days and the city has given them this, this is demoralising for them.""Trinamool MP and Mamata Banerjee's nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, condemned the vandalism at RG Kar Medical College, saying it had crossed all acceptable limits. ""The hooliganism and vandalism at RG Kar tonight have exceeded all acceptable limits. As a public representative, I just spoke with @CPKolkata, urging him to ensure that every individual responsible for today’s violence is identified, held accountable, and made to face the law within the next 24 hours, regardless of their political affiliations. The demands of the protesting doctors are fair and justified. This is the minimum they should expect from the government. Their safety and security must be prioritized,"" Abhishek posted on X.BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, alleged that the vandalism was orchestrated by ""TMC goons"" sent by Mamata Banerjee. ""Mamata Banerjee has sent her TMC goons to the apolitical protest rally near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She thinks that she is the most shrewd person in the world and that people won't figure out the cunning plan of her goons, disguised as protesters, mixing with the crowd and carrying out vandalism inside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,"" Adhikari said in a post on X.Adhikari also alleged that the miscreants were given safe passage by the police. ""They were given safe passage by the police, who either ran away or looked the other way so that these thugs could enter the hospital premises and destroy areas containing crucial evidence so that it doesn't get picked up by the CBI,"" he claimed.The horrific rape and murder of the on-duty doctor have sent shockwaves across the nation, sparking silent protests, candlelight marches, and 'Reclaim the Night' rallies in several parts of the country. Doctors' associations are demanding assurances of minimum security in their workplaces.The semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found on the morning of August 9 in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata.Amid the ongoing tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the tragedy, the investigation into the heinous crime has been handed over to the CBI. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has assured full support to the CBI, emphasizing the need to solve the case at the earliest.Kolkata Police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy has been arrested in connection with the case. However, doctors, citing autopsy report findings, believe that more than one person was involved in the assault and murder of the doctor.The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the transfer of the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).","Violence erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning.

He stressed the need for “more people-centric engagement, a halt to border killings, conclusion of the Teesta water-sharing agreement, and steps to ensure supply of essential commodities”.The foreign affairs adviser said PM Modi extending his best wishes to Yunus had shown the way forward in terms of New Delhi’s keenness to work with Bangladesh’s interim govt and fulfil the people’s shared aspirations.Hossain said the interim govt was committed to ensuring “peaceful coexistence of multiple communities in Bangladesh, including the minorities” with zero tolerance for any violence or acts of intimidation.Hossain briefed the high commissioner on the current situation, acknowledging that the country recently experienced an uprising “led by courageous students”, which he described as a “second liberation” from “authoritarianism and repression”.","Bangladesh’s interim govt conveyed to New Delhi its objection to ex-PM Sheikh Hasina making statements from India.

This escalation in violence has raised concerns about the security situation in the region.In July, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) informed the Lok Sabha that up to July 21 this year, 28 people, including civilians and security personnel, had lost their lives in 11 terror-related incidents and 24 counter-terror operations.",The operation resulted in the death of an Army Captain from the 48 Rashtriya Rifles. Security forces recovered four blood-soaked rucksacks and M-4 carbines from the site. The terrorists are holed up in a riverine in Assar.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112516135,imgsize-1056843,width-400,resizemode-4/112516135.jpg"

Supreme Court Warns of Bail Cancellation Over Sopan Gade’s Celebratory Rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/irked-by-rally-supreme-court-threatens-to-cancel-bail/articleshow/112504924.cms,"Times View It has happened in the past that politicians accused of serious crimes have celebrated the occasion of being given bail like an acquittal. The apex court has rightly warned against over the top displays on such occasions.

NEW DELHI: Politicians , imprisoned for alleged crimes, are typically greeted by unruly celebrations by their supporters when they get bail, leading to inconvenience to the public. In what could be a cautionary tale for them, SC Tuesday took a serious view of the practice and threatened to cancel the bail it had granted to an alleged criminal of Maharashtra's Newasa for taking out a motorcade and getting showered with flowers by a JCB machine.Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013. His bail plea in the murder case was rejected by trial court and Bombay HC bench at Aurangabad considering his criminal antecedents, absconding during pendency of trial and tactics to delay trial.On Tuesday, the complainant in the case, which related to murder of advocate Riyaz Pathan, complained before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan that days after SC granted bail considering that he has undergone almost a decade of incarceration, the accused roamed around Newasa town in a huge motorcade apparently to terrorise witnesses.Seeking cancellation of Sopan Gade's bail, complainant Asif Khan told SC that ""On Dec 16 last year, to create his fear among the people, Sopan organised a rally in his four-wheeler accompanied by 100 to 150 four-wheelers and 70 to 80 two-wheelers. It was telecast live on social media. They burst crackers, showered flowers from JCB to felicitate the accused. The motorcade caused a traffic jam on the NH for five to six hours.""The bench was furious and said it has become a habit with leaders to go around the town with supporters in a rally after getting bail. When Sopan's counsel said his supporters arranged the rally, the bench said, ""You file an apology for going in a motorcade and organising a rally. You also file an undertaking that you will never indulge in any such activities in future.""","Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013.

However, they have also suffered from traditional prejudices. But I am glad to note that the Government has given equal importance to women’s welfare and women’s empowerment. The budget allocation for this purpose has more than tripled in the last decade,” Murmu said.She cited the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, the law that seeks to make way for reservation for women in Parliament and assemblies to assert that it is “aimed at ensuring real empowerment of women”. “Speaking of justice, let me also mention here that in adopting the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita from July this year, we have removed one more relic of the colonial era. The new code is oriented towards ensuring justice for the victims of crime instead of focusing on punishment alone. I see this change as a tribute to the freedom fighters,” she said.Speaking about the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, President Murmu while highlighting that the number of eligible voters stood at nearly 97 crore said that “this was a historic record, making it the largest electoral exercise humankind has ever witnessed”. She congratulated the the Election Commission of India for the “smooth and flawless conduct of such a gigantic event”. “India’s successful conduct of elections strengthens democratic forces around the world,” she added.",President Droupadi Murmu said social justice is a top priority for the Narendra Modi govt.

JAMMU: Captain Deepak Singh of 48 Rashtriya Rifles died of bullet wounds Wednesday while leading an overnight counteroffensive against a group of three to four heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists in Assar of Doda district — marking the 17th security casualty in J&K since May, with 13 fatalities in Jammu region and an additional four killed in Kashmir.Captain Singh’s team gunned down a terrorist, while a civilian was wounded in the crossfire. Security sources said there could be more terrorist casualties as four blood-soaked rucksacks and clothing were discovered at the site, alongside an American M4 carbine with an infrared thermal scope, an AK-series assault rifle, grenades, and ammunition. Thermal scopes detect heat signatures emitted by people, allowing them to function equally well during the day or night.“Warlike stores have been found. Bloodstains on the grass and rocks were seen at the site, indicating wounds,” an official said. “Firing continues. Operation is ongoing.”The 25-year-old Captain, enlisted in 2020 following his graduation from NDA, was the sixth soldier from Uttarakhand to die in J&K this year, after five men from 22 Garhwal Rifles were killed in an ambush on a two-truck patrol in Kathua district on July 8.He leaves behind his parents and two elder sisters, both married. His father Mahesh Singh was an inspector with Uttarakhand police and served as confidential assistant to the DGP before his retirement earlier this year. The family, originally from Kumaon, currently resides in Kuanwala on the outskirts of Dehradun.Earlier fatalities in Jammu zone included a soldier in Poonch on July 23, a Captain and three soldiers from 10 Rashtriya Rifles in Doda on July 15, and the five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles on July 8. A CRPF constable was also killed in Kathua on June 12, and Corporal Vikky Pahade died in an ambush on an IAF convoy in Poonch on May 4.In Kashmir, two soldiers were killed in Anantnag on Aug 10, and two others died in separate gunfights in Kupwara on July 24 and 27.Officials said security forces launched a search operation late Tuesday afternoon in the dense Shivgarh-Assar forest after receiving intelligence about suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists hiding there. As the troops advanced, the terrorists fired, triggering a shootout that continued till late after nightfall. Gunfire resumed at first light and Captain Singh, who was leading from the front, was struck in the chest. He was taken to a military hospital but could not be saved.Security sources suspect that the terrorists involved in the Assar gunfight may be the same who escaped a brief shooting Sunday at Basantgarh in Udhampur. Assar, located about 91km from Doda town via NH244 and 40km from Patnitop in Udhampur district, had been untouched by the summer’s terrorist violence.Official sources estimated that of the 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists active in J&K, nearly 55 to 60 are in Jammu zone. The recent spike in violence has been attributed to “highly trained intruders” from Pakistan, operating in small groups of three to four and armed with sophisticated weapons such as M4 carbines, and using advanced techs like iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery.The capability of these groups to coordinate attacks remains a major challenge for security forces in the remote and rugged landscape, dotted with deep gorges, thick woods, mountain caves, and other natural hideouts that provide ample cover.A landmine blast along the LoC in Mandi area of Poonch district injured a soldier and two porters Wednesday. The injured have been identified as Havildar Inderjeet Singh and porters Shakeel Hussain and Neeraj Choudhary. All three were immediately shifted to a military hospital.The forward areas along the LoC are lined with landmines as part of an anti-infiltration obstacle system. These landmines can sometimes be displaced due to soil erosion and heavy rain, leading to accidental blasts.On Jan 18, “Agniveer” soldier Ajay Singh from Ludhiana was killed and two others were injured in a similar landmine blast in the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district.","Captain Deepak Singh of 48 Rashtriya Rifles died of bullet wounds Wednesday.

"Pain of partition: Canals full of corpses seen with disdainful eyes, but still goodness of some remembered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pain-of-partition-canals-full-of-corpses-seen-with-disdainful-eyes-but-still-goodness-of-some-remembered/articleshow/112531938.cms,"FEROZEPUR: Although the people of the two countries, which became independent on 14 and 15 August 1947 respetively, celebrate their respective independence days every year on these dates but lakhs of Punjabis who paid the price for this freedom are still missing today. If someone is alive, then the soul trembles just by imagining the scene described by him, but those who took all those things on themselves may have had their hearts turned to stone.Of course, two new countries were born with the partition line drawn by the white Radcliffe, but millions of stories of the loss of Punjabis, the most hardworking and generous people in the world, have been coming out.One of them, 88-years-old Mata Gurdeep Kaur, a resident of Ferozepur city, said that even in that era of hatred and kilings, goodness was seen to win. Mata Gurdeep Kaur said that her father was Deputy Director in Horticulture Department and he was posted at Multan (a district of Pakistani Punjab). Their village Veeram was in Tehsil Kasur of District Lahore.Mata Gurdeep Kor says that before the partition of Pakistan, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of all religions used to share each other's sorrows and joys in a very good environment, but after being provoked by some fanatics, that period of slaughter during the partition. It started which makes the soul tremble even by remembering it. He said that when they were coming towards Punjab from canal to canal on carts, the canals were full of dead bodies. The slaughter was done with such brutality that many people's legs, arms, hands, heads etc. were seen in a canal separate from the torso. She said that once the Muslim robbers stopped their caravan on the way, but in exchange for money and gold, they agreed to let go of the Hindu Sikh girls. She said with tears in her eyes that most of the people's money like gold was left behind in Pakistan, but if someone brought it, he was robbed on the way. She said that her family reached Khalra after being hungry and thirsty for three days, then went to Amritsar and got tea without milk for the first time.Mata Gurdeep Kaur said that at the time of partition in 1947, she was 11 years old and studied in the fifth standard. The Muslim principal of the school one day saw that only Hindu and Sikh girls had come to the school, not a single Muslim girl had come to the school. When he inquired about this with his staff, she found out that the Muslims had a plan to attack the school and take away the Hindu and Sikh girls. On this, the principal locked all the girls in a hall and immediately called the army. The parents of all the girls were called under the security of the soldiers.Mata Gurdeep Kaur says that on reaching in India her family was heading to Delhi on train when a Muslim TT told them that the Muslim rioters are not sparing any Hindu or Sikh. “You hide in the toilet of the train, if anyone knocks on the door, do not open the door till I call you by your name once you arrived at Delhi,” she recollect while adding that this is how a Muslim TT saved our father's life. “For us, he had become a Masiah. If people were fanatic at that time, there were also many good people who risked their lives to save Hindus and Sikhs,” she added.","Mata Gurdeep Kaur, 88, says that even in that era of hatred and kilings, goodness was seen to win.

"CSE calls for uniformity in India’s upcoming national carbon market, seeks rigorous monitoring cycles for making it effective",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cse-calls-for-uniformity-in-indias-upcoming-national-carbon-market-seeks-rigorous-monitoring-cycles-for-making-it-effective/articleshow/112531545.cms,"NEW DELHI: As India prepares to roll out its own national compliance-based carbon market , the Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) has brought out a report assessing several emission-trading schemes, and suggested bringing uniformity in the upcoming market and introducing “heavy penalties and rigorous monitoring cycles” for making the system effective.To ensure uniformity, it suggested freeing up the carbon-intensive sectors from the ‘perform, achieve and trade’ (PAT) scheme at the earliest, so that ‘carbon credit and trading scheme’ (CCTS) remains the only nationwide scheme for these sectors, leaving no room for mismanagement and confusion.Suggestions from the CSE, a Delhi-based think tank, come in the backdrop of the govt’s announcement in the 2024-25 budget about a plan to put in place “appropriate regulations” for the transition of hard-to-abate sectors (such as steel and cement) from the PAT mode to an Indian carbon market (ICM) mode.“A roadmap for moving the ‘hard to abate’ industries from ‘energy efficiency’ targets to ‘emission targets’ will be formulated,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharam had announced in her budget speech on July 23.Carbon market is one of the tools to combat climate change where credits are assigned to projects that can reduce greenhouse gases. These credits, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), are then priced and traded. People and businesses that wish to offset their emissions can buy these credits and ‘neutralise’ their carbon footprints.“The upcoming ICM scheme should kick start with a large coverage of the country’s emissions. A single nation-wide carbon market scheme for carbon-intensive sectors should be brought in to ensure effective implementation and avoid any complexity. For this scheme to be effective, it also needs to ensure a high carbon price, data integrity and transparency,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.Formation of the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) had first been announced under the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2022. Later, CCTS was notified in July 2023 with an aim to reduce GHG emissions .Speaking about the PAT scheme , Nivit Yadav, programme director of industrial pollution at CSE, said, “The scheme was initiated with the good intention of increasing energy efficiency in industrial sectors, but faced several shortcomings in implementation. Our analysis shows it has achieved marginal emissions reduction, which is not enough as India attempts to travel towards decarbonisation, especially in the hard-to-abate industries.""",The Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE) has brought out a report assessing several emission-trading schemes.
