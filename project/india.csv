Those supplying 'aatank' struggling to get 'atta': PM Modi's veiled dig at Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/those-supplying-aatank-struggling-to-get-atta-pm-modis-veiled-dig-at-pakistan/articleshow/109446788.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi told an election rally in MP's Damoh on Friday that with ""clouds of war"" spreading across the world, ""India needs a govt that can work on a war footing and protect the country under all circumstances, and this work can be done by a BJP govt which returns to office with an absolute majority"".His remark comes against the backdrop of escalating tensions in West Asia.While India is powering on as world's fastest developing nation, ""one of our neighbours, which was a supplier of 'aatank (terrorism)', is now struggling to procure 'atta' (flour),"" PM Modi said, alluding to Pakistan , where inflation rate is as high as 20%.Ourprinciple is nation first,” the PM said, justifying India’s move to disregard international pressure and purchase oil from Russia after the latter’s invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022. “We took this decision in national interest to ensure that people of our country get cheap oil and farmers get adequate fertilisers,” the PM said, adding: “Today, our country has a govt that neither comes under pressure nor bows before anyone.”It was the PM’s fourth visit to MP in a fortnight. In his last meeting in MP, five days ago, he had attacked INDIA bloc, saying one of its constituents wanted to eliminate India’s nuclear arsenal. On Friday, he alleged that Congress had kept the defence sector weak for decades. “The entire country has seen how they (INDIA bloc) deployed their whole strength so that our Air Force was not strengthened and Rafale fighter jets did not come to the country. Had Congress govt been there, Indian-made Tejas fighter planes would n ot have soared into the skies.”“This year, India sold arms worth Rs 21,000 crore to other countries … At this moment, the first consign ment of Brahmos is going to the Philippines today. I congratulate all citizens for this,” PM Modi said.In UP’s Amroha, the PM recalled his visit to Dwarka where he had dived into the sea off the Gujarat coast to perform puja. “Congress leaders had ridiculed me by saying that there was nothing to be worshipped beneath the sea. How can leaders doing politics in the name of Yaduvansh (followers of Lord Krishna) in UP and Bihar align with such people,” he said, a reference to SP president Akhilesh Yadav and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav. He added that opposition leaders have “only cheated Dalits and OBC in the name of social justice”.Attacking the alliance of Akhilesh’s SP & Congress in UP, he said: “Two ‘shehzades’ are busy shooting a film which has already been rejected in UP.” He added that the opposition always goes for “parivarwaad (nepotism), bhrashtachar (corruption) and tushtikaran (communal appeasement) while seeking votes in UP”. Later, addressing a rally in Wardha, without directly naming Rahul, the PM said that Congress knew it wasn’t going to win Lok Sabha polls and so its “yuvraj” was threatening to set the country aflame after the poll results. He was referring to Congress’s claim that “India will be ablaze if Narendra PM Modi gets a third term as prime minister”.","India needs a govt that can work on a war footing and protect the country under all circumstances, PM Narendra Modi said.

"Lovers, believers, even pyramids in fray in great Indian election",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lovers-believers-even-pyramids-in-fray-in-great-indian-election/articleshow/109446264.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Lovers Party from Tamil Nadu, Indian Believers Party from Telangana, Indian Manush Party from Bengal, National Tiger Party from Bihar, Pyramid Party of India from Karnataka, Viroki Veer Indian Party from Maharashtra - they and dozens and dozens of political parties like them all over India are seeking your vote, undaunted by the fact that most likely you have never heard of them.The world's largest election is nothing without its quirks, and quirks don't get much better than the eye-catching, jaw-dropping names of what EC calls registered unrecognised political parties (RUPPs). Per May 2022 EC data there were 2,796 RUPPs in India. Mortality among RUPPs is high. Many of them contest an election or two and then wither away. Some don't contest elections at all. Since EC rules require a party to fight a poll within five years of registration, RUPPs that don't enter the fray get deregistered. But none of this takes anything away from their entertainment value.You have to chuckle if you see a candidate from Twenty20 Party or Hitech party. Don't be alarmed, if you are allergic to leftwing revolutions, on knowing that Odisha has a Socialist Workers Party. Even CPM won't be particularly worried about it or by Odisha Communist Party.All parties are boastful, telling tall tales to voters, but few describe themselves as the best party, except perhaps, Sabse Acchi Party. A very different signalling comes from UP’s Aapki Apni Party, no boast here, just telling you it’s your own party.Perhaps, a little more serious enterprise is the Right To Recall Party, contesting in Gujarat. Indian election law doesn’t allow voters the r ight to recall their representatives — that’s wrong, thunders this party. Only, no one’s listening. Neither is anyone listening to Haryana’s Aarakshan Virodhi Party, which opposes reservation in a state where Jats are aggressively demanding quotas.The list of odd-named parties is very long. Let’s end with Plurals Party, in Bihar. Led by a lady, it’s “ideology” is, it says, “progressivism”, “liberalism”, “decentralisation” and — wait for this — “Kantianism”.The last is presumably a nod to German philosopher Immanuel Kant. “Kantian” philosophy in Bihar’s ‘kaante ki takkar’ poll battles — you can’t get quirkier than that.","The world's largest election is nothing without its quirks, and quirks don't get much better than the eye-catching, jaw-dropping names of what EC calls registered unrecognised political parties.

"Turnout touches 64% in Phase 1 of Lok Sabha polls, against 66% in 2019",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/turnout-touches-64-in-phase-1-of-lok-sabha-polls-against-66-in-2019/articleshow/109444315.cms,"NEW DELHI: The first phase of polling for the 2024 general election — covering the largest chunk of 102 Lok Sabha seats across 21 states and Union Territories — witnessed an encouraging turnout of 65.5%, while remaining largely smooth and peaceful even in vulnerable areas like the Naxal-hit Bastar region and West Bengal that witnessed violence in the run-up. Incidents of violence were reported in Manipur which still managed to log a turnout over 70%The overall turnout for these seats in 2019 was 66%, though seats in Assam and Udhampur in J&K have undergone delimitation since the last pollDefying summer heat almost all over the country and rain in J&K's Udhampur, people came out in large numbers despite talk of a low-key campaign.Sources said the turnout is expected to go up further, with long queues seen at many polling stations well after polling hours. As per rule, all voters who are queued up at the polling station when polling time ends are allowed to cast their vote. Election Commission has worked hard over the past couple of years to make a smooth and peaceful Lok Sabha election a reality. The first phase turnout is encouraging and should enthuse voters to come out in even higher numbers in the remaining phases, a senior EC functionary told TOI.West Bengal, which has a history of poll violence and clashes between rival party workers, saw peaceful polling on Friday barring stray altercations in Cooch Behar. EC said none of these incidents had any effect on polling, as evident from the 79.4% turnout recorded across the three parliamentary constituencies of Alipurduars, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri.Tripura too saw incident-free polling with the voter turnout touching 81.5% and Sikkim logged 80%, while other states where turnouts soared beyond 70% included Manipur, Puducherry (78.3%), Meghalaya (74.5%) and Assam (73.4%). Udhampur saw polling of 67.9% despite rain and terror threats.In Bastar constituency of Chhattisgarh, voters defied threats from Left-wing extremists to clock a 67% turnout. As many as 56 villages in Bastar had polling booths set up for the first time in a LS poll. Like all turnouts put out on Friday, the one in Bastar remains tentative and is expected to go up further as polling parties return from interior areas and submit their reports.Manipur, where ethnic violence has been a major law and order concern since mid-2023, saw by-and-large peaceful polling and an overall turnout of 70.8%.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which have traditionally been low-to-moderate turnout states, maintained the trend with 60.3% and 48.9% voting respectively. Rajasthan too had lower turnout than the national average at 57.3%, as did Maharashtra at 61.2%. Nagaland (56.9%) and Mizoram (56.6%), which usually see high turnout, witnessed some disappointment. Tamil Nadu, where polling for all 39 seats was held, recorded 69.1% turnout.Recounting the vivid pictures of democracy in action during Phase 1, EC shared how the Shompen tribe of Great Nicobar in Andaman and Nicobar Islands made history by casting their votes for the first time in a general election. Meanwhile, an elderly couple in Mizoram reaffirmed their vow to vote together. In Arunachal Pradesh, an elderly woman trekked to the polling station rather than settle for the home voting facility. In Bodh Gaya, Buddhist monks proudly displayed their inked fingers.With the first phase over, polling for Lok Sabha has been completed for 10 states/UTs, and assembly polls wound up in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The latter states recorded a turnout of 68% and 66% in the assembly polls.","The first phase of polling for the 2024 general election witnessed an encouraging turnout of 65.5%.

Supreme Court: Must Give Due Importance To Natural Wealth: Sc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/must-give-due-importance-to-natural-wealth-sc/articleshow/109444935.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that Article 48A of the Constitution, envisaging protection of environment and safeguarding of forests and wildlife, has a direct nexus with citizens’ right to life and asked govts to protect forests to save the country and the world from ill-effects of climate change.A bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S V N Bhatti pulled up govt officials for being in cahoots with one Mohd Abdul Qasim, who had tried converting forest land for personal use since the 1980s in Kompally village in Andhra’s Warangal district, and imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on Telangana govt for taking contradictory stands.Supreme Court also criticised how a well-reasoned order of an Andhra Pradesh HC judge, who opted for AP HC after the state’s bifurcation, was impermissibly reversed by a judge of Telangana HC while entertaining a petition seeking review of the earlier judgment that had denied Qasim any right over forest land.Quoting a 1854 letter of a tribal chief to the then US President saying that “earth does not belong to man; man belongs to earth”, the bench said, “Article 48A imposes a clear mandate upon the state as a directive principle of state policy, while Article 51A(g) correspondingly casts a duty upon a citizen to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for fellow living creatures.” This is a second verdict in two months where SC has sought to elevate environment protection to the same pedestal as fundamental rights .Last month, in a case dealing with protection of Great Indian Bustard, the court had underscored the importance of protection of environment although it also said this had to be balanced with the need to ensure faster development. A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Mishra had said, “Climate change may impact the constitutional guarantee of right to equality. Without a clean environment which is stable and unimpacted by vagaries of climate change, right to life is not fully realised. Right to health is impacted due to factors such as air pollution, shifts in vector-borne diseases, rising temperatures, droughts, shortages in food supplies due to crop failure, storms and flooding.”In the Telangana matter, writing the 60-page judgment, Justice Sundresh said, “These two provisions qua a forest ought to be understood in light of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. We say so, as they represent the collective conscience of the Constitution. If the continued existence and protection of forests is in interest of humanity, various species, and nature, then there can be no other interpretation than to read the constitutional ethos into these provisions.SC said the anthropocentric approach must give way to ecocentric approach. “Wealth of a country must be seen not only from the perspective of mere revenue, augmented through its industries and business activities. Rather, it must be seen by giving due importance to its natural wealth which contributes much more than the other factors,” it said.",Supreme Court has ruled that Article 48A of the Constitution has a direct nexus with citizens’ right to life. The court asked govts to protect forests to save the country and the world from ill-effects of climate change. This is a second verdict in two months where SC has sought to elevate environment protection to the same pedestal as fundamental rights.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109449930,imgsize-1097197,width-400,resizemode-4/109449930.jpg"

Two polling stations — DFO social forestry building and KV Building at NERIST— were part of the EC initiative called ‘sakhi booths’.Both voters and polling officials in sakhi booths are women.Though the voter turnout at the two polling stations was less than 50%, the gift of sanitary napkins came as a pleasant surprise to the women who turned up despite the rain. About 600 of the 1400-odd registered voters turned up to exercise their franchise, said polling officials.“All female voters who came for voting were given sanitary pads. Some mothers took the pads for their daughters. It was a kind of incentive and gratitude gift for female voters who came to vote on a rainy day,” said Hage Sunya, in-charge of the initiative at one of the polling stations.

"Up against big players, Azad stirred up Nagina’s poll pot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-against-big-players-azad-stirred-up-naginas-poll-pot/articleshow/109447554.cms,"From Advocate to Dalit icon

It’s as if a spell has been cast on the people,” said Kafeel Ansari. It sounded better untranslated, in the Hindi that he used in a charming accent from nowhere. “Jaise kisi ne hawa mein phoonkh mari ho.”Sitting under a tree in Hargaon Chandan that lined a wide road coming from Nagina city, Ansari, the zila panchayat member who once fought the assembly elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket – and lost — was talking about Chandrashekhar Azad , the David from his eponymous Azad Samaj Party now up against Goliaths, BJP, SP , Congress, BSP.Azad, a moustache-twirling sturdy man, sunglasses adorning a resolute face that some consider handsome, shot into mobile screen fame — later carving out a legitimate place for himself in Dalit icon ography in Saharanpur and adjoining districts of UP — when he took on upper caste men in 2017 with a chutzpah that the other Dalit symbol of hope and power, Mayawati, had relinquished. He was an instant sensation. It helped that his rebellion, backed by education and training as an advocate, came at a time when reports of Dalits being tied to poles and whipped in public demonstrations of unbreachable social hierarchy were coming in from many parts of the country.The Bhim Army founder, a man who once affixed Ravan to his name — he quietly dropped it somewhere along the way, the metaphor sitting uncomfortably as Ram rose once again in Ayodhya and beyond — walked a blazing path after that, with Dalits, especially in pockets of western UP, inscribing his name on wedding cards like a presiding deity and hoisting framed photos in drawing rooms alongside Ambedkar’s.But Azad, not yet 40, soon realised that viral WhatsApp forwards and backward politics were not as organically linked as he once may have perceived. He began to cosy up to the big boys and girls of the political arena — Congress, SP, BSP—and was largely fobbed off. For this Lok Sabha polls, talks with Akhilesh Yadav looked promising initially but in the end, Azad was once again left alone. SP has gone with a retired additional judge called Manoj Kumar and BSP with Surendra Pal Singh. BJP, meanwhile, has reposed faith in Om Kumar, a three time MLA from the region. In 2019, the reserved seat was won by BSP, then in an alliance with SP.“Iss baar, ketli (Azad’s poll symbol, the kettle) sab par haavi hai,” said Ganga Ram, 56, who works at Ambika Plywood in Najibabad, a town near Nagina. Asked why he feels Azad will overwhelm everyone else, he grinned. “Don’t you need tea from the kettle to start your day? All of us do.” Sitting next to him, Ratan Singh, 78, raised his hand in glory and announced loudly after an initial hesitation that he has the biggest kettle at home. The old man from Jalabpur Gudal village gesticulated to show just how big. Others around him smiled indulgently at his child-like exuberance.Whoever wins, it is Azad who has infused drama and purpose in the election process underway at Nagina, turning the seat into one of UP’s most talked about contests. At Rampur Dass village, even BJP supporters mention his name often. Kuljit Chauhan, who said his vote won’t “move away from kamal”, is happy people are talking about Nagina. “These polls are about him (Azad).”Raisuddin Sayyed Ahmed, 68, who runs Mehboob Wood, said that if the Muslim vote doesn’t split in the constituency that has a large presence of his community at 43%, followed by Dalits, 21%, Nagina’s result could “surprise many”. He added: “We are from a generation that went with Netaji (Mulayam Singh). But he’s gone. His party isn’t the same today. In contrast, BJP is a stronger party now than before. They have the men and machinery. They could win in the end.”Azad himself is careful with what he says. He told TOI: “I always wanted to be part of INDIA bloc, but I was not included. I am now independent of any ideology or party line.

Within half an hour after leaving his Babupara home, he was at a local hospital in Bhetaguri, where a TMC worker, Ananta Burman, was allegedly injured in a BJP attack.""Burman's attackers are hiding at Nisith Pramanik's home in Bhetaguri. The EC should search it,"" he said while coming out of the hospital. He then reached Chowpathi High School, where Pramanik was supposed to cast vote.Juggling calls between two cell phones, Guha then left for Uttarpara's Ruyerkuti Uttarpara Prathamik Vidyalaya centre where, he claimed, voters were being stopped by BJP workers. ""BJP has attacked our workers and are now stopping voters. If I roll out an instruction, bloodbath will happen in Dinhata but I will never do that,"" he said.Junior Union home minister Nisith Pramanik has only tasted defeat once in past five years, in the 2021 assembly bypolls in Dinhata, where BJP lost by 1.6 lakh votes.

After casting vote, he returned to Uttarpara village following reports of disturbance.

This time, not only are the stakes high for CPM in Kerala, but also its chances. In 2019, the party won just one out of the 20 seats in Kerala. In Bengal and Tripura – two states where CPM was in office for decades – the party became a marginal player and is unlikely to do much better in these polls. But in Kerala, CPM feels it has a fighting chance to improve its tally and become a bit more relevant nationally.Taking no chances, the party has fielded several heavyweights — Thomas Isaac, KK Shailaja, MV Jayarajan and K Radhakrishnan among others — to wrest back seats from Congress in constituencies considered Left strongholds.More importantly, seeking much-needed consolidation of minority votes (Muslims and Christians account for 47% of the state’s population), CPM is going ballistic against CAA and casting itself as the “champion of secularism”. By banking on Christian and Muslim voters as well as its traditional Ezhava community (the largest Hindu community in Kerala) supporters, the party expects to win five to eight seats in Kerala this time.Until the Kerala assembly polls in 2021, CPM was known to field candidates, even cardholding party members, as ‘Independents’ in certain constituencies that are not their strongholds. This was done to lure the electorate voting for ‘others’, especially a section of Christian and Muslim communities who are hesitant to vote for the party’s hammer, sickle and star symbol. But this time, CPM has also fielded non-party persons under its symbol — KS Hamza in Ponnani, Joice George in Idukki and M Mukesh in Kollam.It is certain that the party is pinning its hopes on its increased influence among the minority communities, especially Muslims. “But that alone is not the reason for fielding Independent candidates under its party symbol. The Election Commission will count only the votes which the CPM candidates win and that too under its party symbol. In the current Lok Sabha, the party has just three MPs which is an alltime low in the history of CPM,” said Jacob George, noted political analyst.This time, CPM took the lead in setting the agenda for the April 26 polls. The Supreme Court verdict on electoral bonds seems to have opened a Pandora’s Box and CPM, as one of the petition ers in the case, cashed in on it. “We are the only party other than CPI which decided not to receive electoral bonds. We are functioning with funds donated by the masses whereas BJP and Congress run their parties using funds given by the corporates,” said M V Govindan, CPM’s Kerala state secretary.Given the fact that the party could make inroads into the strongholds of the minorities, especially Muslims, CPM has been keen on opposing CAA right from the outset. To this end, the party has already planned mega meets in all the 14 districts of Kerala to protest the Union govt’s move to implement CAA. “When we were invited to the consecration of Ram idol at Ayodhya, we made it clear that we will not attend the function as it is against secularism. At the same time, those like Congress were vac illating till the last minute,” Govindan said.Convincing voters that CPM has got a larger role at the national level in the current scenario is not easy. Yet, that is the mantle the party wants to wear, the ‘real’ protector of the Tricolour and secularism. “Our priority is to dethrone the fascist BJP government at the Centre which is being controlled by RSS. Congress, the major opposition party in the country, couldn’t lead the campaign against the dictatorial BJP govt. In West Bengal, BJP has 18 MPs but Congress failed to explore the possibilities of forming an alliance with Trinamool Congress and Left parties on the lines of the alliance in Tamil Nadu. It is at this juncture that importance of CPM at the national level increases,” says CPM politburo member MA Baby.CPM’s campaigns and Kerala govt’s initiatives like moving a resolution in the assembly against CAA have helped it win the confidence of some sections in the Muslim community. Organisations like Samastha Kerala Jemiyyathul Ulama, an outfit of Sunni scholars that enjoys substantial support among Muslims in the state, have drawn closer to CPM. The issues stemming from women’s entry in Sabarimala and sub sequent Hindu backlash was a major setback for CPM in 2019 polls, but now it’s a thing of the past.At the same time, the major hurdle for CPM in this election is the corruption charges against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) govt in the state. Many central agencies are probing corruption charges against several leading CPM functionaries. Nepotism and corruption charges against its leaders, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his daughter Veena Vijayan, is giving a tough time to CPM cadres on campaign trail. Continuing financial woes have applied the brakes on many of the state govt’s welfare schemes, like disbursement of pensions and distribution of essential commodities through the public distribution system at subsidised rates, and this too is working against CPM’s prospects.To what extent and how the increasing influence of BJP in the state is going to affect CPM’s chances is not fully clear. The CPM, however, is content to go with the traditional view that BJP’s gains will be at Congress’ expense. But the hope that the party’s tally would be better than last time seems to have infused enthusiasm into the party leadership as well as the rank and file.","In 2019, the party won just one out of the 20 seats in Kerala.

It is at this juncture that importance of CPM at the national level increases,” says CPM politburo member MA Baby.CPM’s campaigns and Kerala govt’s initiatives like moving a resolution in the assembly against CAA have helped it win the confidence of some sections in the Muslim community. Organisations like Samastha Kerala Jemiyyathul Ulama, an outfit of Sunni scholars that enjoys substantial support among Muslims in the state, have drawn closer to CPM. The issues stemming from women’s entry in Sabarimala and sub sequent Hindu backlash was a major setback for CPM in 2019 polls, but now it’s a thing of the past.At the same time, the major hurdle for CPM in this election is the corruption charges against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) govt in the state. Many central agencies are probing corruption charges against several leading CPM functionaries. Nepotism and corruption charges against its leaders, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his daughter Veena Vijayan, is giving a tough time to CPM cadres on campaign trail. Continuing financial woes have applied the brakes on many of the state govt’s welfare schemes, like disbursement of pensions and distribution of essential commodities through the public distribution system at subsidised rates, and this too is working against CPM’s prospects.To what extent and how the increasing influence of BJP in the state is going to affect CPM’s chances is not fully clear. The CPM, however, is content to go with the traditional view that BJP’s gains will be at Congress’ expense. But the hope that the party’s tally would be better than last time seems to have infused enthusiasm into the party leadership as well as the rank and file.","In 2019, the party won just one out of the 20 seats in Kerala. In Bengal and Tripura – two states where CPM was in office for decades – the party became a marginal player. CPM feels it has a fighting chance to improve its tally and become a bit more relevant nationally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109452835,imgsize-808280,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109452835.jpg"

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

Interim Budget 2024: National Pension System Update and Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-2024-national-pension-system-update-and-details/articleshow/106926120.cms,"Budget 2024 : The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS ). The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme, is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.According to an ET report, the committee has explored certain adjustments and assurances during its discussions.However, the members are reluctant to increase the financial burden or revert to the old pension scheme , as per the mentioned sources. The government may opt for public consultations before making any decisions.""The fine print is being worked out,"" one of the officials told the financial daily. The report will center on improving the NPS while addressing concerns from some pensioners compared to the old pension scheme (OPS).""The report will not be prescriptive and any changes, if at all required, will be weighed against the fiscal impact and it will be then put for the public consultation,"" the official further added.In April of the previous year, the government established a committee to examine the matter of pensions within the NPS for government employees. The committee's mandate was to propose solutions for enhancing NPS pension benefits while taking fiscal considerations into account.The National Pension System has been applied to all central government employees who joined on or after January 1, 2004, excluding those in the armed forces. As per the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), with the exception of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, all state governments have notified and implemented the NPS for their employees.The controversy surrounding the NPS intensified last year when states governed by the Congress party, including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Himachal Pradesh, opted to return to the previous defined benefit system. Under this system, government employees were entitled to receive 50% of their last-drawn salary as a monthly pension. In contrast, the NPS operates as a defined contribution scheme, where employees build a retirement corpus. It is noteworthy that Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have since transitioned to BJP-led governments.The opposition argues that state government employees shouldn't depend on the unpredictable stock market where NPS funds are invested. States that returned to the old pension system also requested a refund of the accumulated NPS corpus, but the government rejected it, stating it's not possible under current laws.The government has said that the old pension scheme is not financially viable because it continually increases the burden on the treasury, which is why it was discontinued.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and numerous economists have voiced opposition to reinstating the old pension scheme. They argue that such a decision would disrupt the fiscal equilibrium of the states.Last month, the government informed the Rajya Sabha that there is currently no proposal being considered for the reinstatement of the old pension scheme (OPS) for central government employees.","The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS) The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.

Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19. Following a fake video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan endorsing a political party made rounds on the internet, a digitally manipulated clip of actor Ranveer Singh is being shared online.In the video, the actor is shown criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the centre, at the same time seeking votes for Congress.The video ends with Singh urging voters to vote for “nyaay” and the tagline 'Vote For Congress ' is seen flashing on the screen.It doesn’t take a second look to identify that the video is doctored. The lip movements of the actor in the video clearly doesn't match the audio. Notably, it is an old video shot when the actor visited Kashi, and in fact praised PM Modi for changing the face of the 'City of Ghats'.In the original video, Singh says, “I cannot express in words the experience that I have had today. I have been a devotee of lord Shiva and I have come here for the first time…” Here’s the original video:Recently, Aamir Khan filed an FIR against a deepfake video that showed him endorsing a specific political party. The actor’s office strongly denied any connection to politics or affiliation with any political party and issued a statement.“We want to clarify [that] Aamir Khan has never endorsed any political party in his 35-year career. He has dedicated his efforts to raising public awareness through campaigns for the Election Commission for many past elections,” the actor’s office said in the statement, as per news agency ANI.“We are alarmed now to see a recent viral video alleging Mr Khan is promoting a particular party. He would like to clarify [that] this is a fake and totally untrue video. He has reported the matter to various authorities, including filing an FIR with the Cyber Crime Cell of Mumbai Police,” the statement added.A video appears to be from his TV show “Satyamev Jayate,” that aired almost a decade ago.","Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19.
