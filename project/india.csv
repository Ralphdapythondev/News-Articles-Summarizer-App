He was 87.""He suffered a stroke a year ago and wasn't keeping well. But it wasn't a stroke this time. He died of pneumonia,"" his daughter Anaheita Kapadia told PTI.Born in Lahore to a Parsi family, Daruwalla’s collections of poems include, ""Under Orion"" and ""The Keeper of the Dead"", which earned him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1984.In 2015, he returned the award as a protest against the Akademi’s inability to stand up boldly against rising intolerance against writers. His ""Landscapes"" received the Commonwealth Poetry Award, Asia, in 1987. In a press release on Friday, the Sahitya Akademi described him as “one of the greatest poets of modern India”Poet and professor Ashwani Kumar said that Daruwalla enjoyed an “edge over his contemporaries like Nissim Ezekiel, A K Ramanujan, and Jayanta Mahapatra in social awareness of history and the mastery over emotional immediacy of language. He redefined the land and landscape of Indian poetry in English.”A recipient of Padma Shri in 2014, Daruwalla’s work was translated into various languages ranging including Spanish, Swedish, German and Russian. Sahitya Akademi recipient writer Mridula Garg said that the poet loved life and history with equal passion. “Both combined to give his poetry a special cadence and a sense of adventure. The present and the past were intermixed in a way that enthralled the reader as a participant in the history of even those he did not know intimately,” she said.Harish Trivedi, former professor of English in Delhi University, said that as a poet, Daruwalla was as deeply engaged with current political and social issues as he was with the ancient civilisations of Persia and Greece. “He also had a fine sense of metre and rhythm which is now so rare,” he said.Daruwalla’s demise drew tributes from a wide spectrum of prominent people. In a post on social media, Congress politician Jairam Ramesh pointed out that the poet was also “a distinguished IPS officer of the 1958 batch and had spent much time in India's intelligence establishment, including R&AW…Tremendously witty and always with a smile, he spoke truth to power at all times. A man of great compassion and empathy, he reflected all that is noble in our syncretic culture.”","Keki N Daruwalla, one of the foremost poets of post-independent India, passed away in a hospital on Thursday.

Meet the Wolf of WhatsApp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-wolf-of-whatsapp/articleshow/113743565.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“Nanrari vaaril Kayavar Thiruvudayar





Nenjaththu Avalam Ilar”

One afternoon, my phone rang from an unknown number. The caller, claiming to be from the Mumbai Police’s Narcotics Control Wing, had my Aadhaar and PAN details. He accused me of having a consignment linked to narcotics, saying an arrest warrant had been issued in my name. To make his story more convincing, he asked me to accept a video call to show the warrant and mentioned I would be placed under “digital arrest”.Scam calls are now part of daily life. They often begin with an automated message, claiming to be from a govt agency, warning that your phone will be disconnected unless you speak to an “officer”. Once connected, the scammer uses fear and urgency to cause panic, manipulating emotions to drive victims into transferring funds out of sheer anxiety.Another common scam involves phishing emails or messages posing as legitimate banks, prompting you to click links for rewards or refunds. These links install malware, giving scammers remote access to your device. They can steal money and intercept OTPs, leaving you helpless. These operations are run by tech-savvy fraudsters, often based in call centres across the country, while the masterminds remain in safe havens abroad.Scammers impersonate officials from credible organisations such as tax departments, TRAI, customs or the police, using words like “digital arrest” to create panic. Desperate victims transfer money to avoid arrest. In Delhi NCR alone, scammers swindled up to ₹120 crore between June and August.Stolen money is laundered through “layering” or moving between accounts to evade tracking. While some call centres have been busted, the complexity of these networks — scattered victims, accounts and scammers — makes it challenging to eliminate the problem. As long as people fall for these schemes, fraudsters will continue refining their tactics.Swindlers have long preyed on human vulnerabilities, exploiting emotions and bypassing rational thought. History offers many examples.In 300 BC, Greek merchant Hegestratos tried to sink his ship to avoid repaying a loan. In the 17th century, British conman Gregor MacGregor sold fictitious land to wealthy investors. Jeanne de Valois tricked a French Cardinal into buying jewellery for Queen Marie Antoinette, which she stole herself. Victor Lustig ‘sold’ the Eiffel Tower twice, while Charles Ponzi’s schemes netted $65 billion. India’s Natwarlal famously “sold” the Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Parliament.I often wonder — do these fraudsters feel no remorse, or has guilt simply evaporated?Psychologists believe that many fraudsters don’t feel guilty about their actions. They use a mental process called “neutralisation”, where they justify their deeds by thinking, “These people can afford it, and I need the money more than they do.” A sense of entitlement, combined with the thrill of outsmarting others, drives these individuals. Manipulating people becomes a source of inner gratification.Interestingly, even the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar addressed this mindset centuries ago. In his work, he observed sarcastically that cheats live without guilt, while honest people constantly question themselves, burdened by their conscience.Happier than men of conscience are these fraudsters,For they never have any pangs of guilt.“Madam, are you there? A consignment with drugs has been shipped under your name,” said the man on the other end.Feigning anxiety, I played along. “Oh, you caught my consignment? Ketamine or cocaine?”After a brief silence, I added, “You have my Aadhaar, right? Just come and arrest me at home. I am waiting.”The line went dead, and I smiled.My daughter will be proud of me as I borrowed the last line from a Vijay movie.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113743619,imgsize-77150,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/113743619.jpg"

New Delhi: BJP on Friday flayed Congress over the Karnataka govt's decision to withdraw the general consent to the CBI to probe cases in the state amid the MUDA land allotment row, describing it as a response of a ""professional thief and a corrupt party"".Terming the Congress govt's move a bid to evade a CBI probe into the MUDA ""scam"" allegedly involving CM Siddaramaiah , BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said the decision depicted a ""guilty mind"" in itself.""Thousands of crores have been usurped in the MUDA scam .

NEW DELHI: Firing a fresh salvo against Congress ahead of the Haryana polls , BJP on Friday raised the alleged corruption involving Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra when the opposition party was in power in the state.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed the election in the state is a fight between ""Haryana ka laal (son of Haryana)"" and ""dalaal (fixer)"" of the Gandhi family, as he questioned the Congress brass silence on the corruption charges against Vadra and the party's then govt headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda He said peoplehave made up their mind to elect BJP for a third straight term.While Gandhi has been speaking about farmers' issues, he has not said a word about his ""land-grabbing"" brother-in-law, Bhatia said. Hooda is just a mask and the real face of corruption is the Gandhi family, he alleged, citing questionable land deals involving Vadra.In one case, he noted, Vadra's firm allegedly acquired 3.5 acres of land from farmers and the then Hooda govt changed the land use, allowing him to pocket a huge profit by selling the land parcel at four times the purchase price.In another case, farmers resorted to distress selling of their land after the Congress govt in the state issued a notification to acquire their land and then denotified after a builder linked to Vadra bought their land, he alleged.","BJP raises alleged corruption involving Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.

SRINAGAR: If a roller coaster was to morph into life, it would likely be Kashmiri. And, possibly Fayyaz Ganai .The youngster from Kupwara flew on govt's ""Udaan"" scheme to make a life in Kolkata but jolted by the post-Pulwama backlash, Article 370 shutdown and Covid lockdown he never could quite settle down. Coming to Kashmir for safety and forced to Kolkata by circumstances, he was resigned to his fate.Only to be finally back home to become a chef. His story is symbolic of other Kashmiris since 2019.""I don't know how the five years went by,"" says Fayyaz.It is difficult to imagine a more soothing setting in life - the scenic Dal lakefront, milling tourists haggling with eager locals hawking their craft, Kashmiri cuisine adding to their delight, its aroma wafting through the warmth of the day and nip of the night. All forming the mystique of what is Kashmir.But Fayyaz was anxious and searching. A computer operator at a gas agency in Kupwara, he imagined a life beyond the backwaters when, through ""Udaan"", he was recruited by a software giant for its insurance back-office in Kolkata in 2017. The next two years were what he had longed for, till the Pulwama attacks in February 2019 turned his world upside down.""There were attacks on Kashmiris selling shawls in Bengal. My family was worried and asked me to return,"" he said.Fayyaz played smart. As employers understood the pressure on Kashmiris, he flew to Srinagar, and quietly started a restaurant of local delicacies. He used the pretext of marriage to extend his stay and weighed his options.And, just when he felt he could quit the Kolkata job, his world was shattered again on Aug 5, 2019, with the abrogation of Article 370. Kashmir was shut down, the tourist flow stopped. He defaulted on EMIs on a Rs 3 lakh loan taken to set up the restaurant.Desperate, but with considerate employers, Fayyaz returned to Bengal in Oct. But his concerned parents kept nudging him to come back.Hope soared again three months later when basic internet was restored and curfew lifted in Kashmir. ""I resigned on a three-month notice period,"" he recalled. His mind was set on being a quality chef in Srinagar, catering to the taste buds of tourists he imagined flocking to Kashmir again.Again, it was not to be. Covid struck with a nationwide lockdown in March 2020. A hapless Fayyaz took back his resignation. ""I was stranded in Kolkata, and worked from home,"" he recalled.Aided by a scheme to repatriate stranded workers, he returned to Srinagar on WFH for his Kolkata office, and did the remote work till Oct 2022. But this time, he used the stay at home to simultaneously learn the exquisite ""wazwan"" from his brother-in-law, a professional chef. He had his mind made up now. He resigned from his Kolkata job, and made Srinagar his home.Fayyaz has since picked up pieces and put his life together. It has had its ups and downs, more downs than ups. The post-Covid revenge tourism saw an uptick in local and inter-state footfall in 2021, and a solid boom in 2022. But since then, it has been on a slide, with losses mounting.Back home in Kupwara, he has old parents saddled with slip disc, with a monthly medical expenditure of Rs 12,000, and a sister to sustain. His brother Tariq is studying and helps him in the restaurant.Since, the genial young man is hopeful that in future, tourists will be a consistent feature, normalcy would be permanent, and he would see good days. And, just as he had done, Fayyaz is planning to send Tariq out to make a life in Delhi. But, he prays, with better luck.","Fayyaz Ganai flew on govt's ""Udaan"" scheme to make a life in Kolkata.

GURUGRAM: Even as he declared that BJP would retain Nayab Singh Saini as CM if it gets a third term in Haryana, Union home minister Amit Shah sought to put a spoke in Congress's efforts to put a lid on the rift between Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his factional rival Selja by accusing the former Haryana CM of having an anti-Dalit mindset.""Don't get tired as you have to work as CM of Haryana for another five years,"" Shah told Saini, his remarks at a large public rally at grain market at Barara in Ambala consolidating the prominence of Saini who was dramatically catapulted into the CM's office because of party's recognition of the fatigue with his predecessor, Manohar Lal Khattar .In his rally, Shah played up the the differences between Hooda and his in-house Dalit challenger, Selja who is widely perceived to be unhappy over having been marginalised in the distribution of tickets. A day after Congress got Hooda and Selja to appear together at a rally addressed by Rahul Gandhi, Shah seized upon the footage of her conversation with a journo that shone the spotlight on the simmering feud. Asked about whether she would campaign for the candidates belonging to the rival faction, Selja bluntly says she was not going to be invited.Referring to the statement, Shah said that the clip was emblematic of Hooda's anti-Dalit mindset.""Dalit brothers of Haryana have not forgotten the Dohana incident and Nijpur incident. Recently, a journalist asked Selja Ji whether she would go to campaign for Hooda. She answered by saying that although she wants to do that, Hooda will not invite her. Hooda still has the mindset. He fears that he will lose an election if a Dalit woman campaigns for him. But we have given a nomination to our Dalit sister,"" he said at a rally in Ladwa assembly constituency. Hooda and Selja had shared dias, for the first time on Thursday, during a Rahul rally.Reiterating the party's commitment made in its manifesto, Shah promised govt jobs with pension to Haryana youths joining armed forces through Agniveer scheme . ""Join the forces with passion. Haryana and the Indian govt will give jobs with pension to all the Agniveers of Haryana,"" the home minister said, asserting ""Pakki pension wali sarkari naukri (govt jobs with pension)"".In Rewari, which has had strong links with the Army, Shah praised mothers for raising their children with sacrifice and valour to protect the country's borders. ""During Congress govts in Haryana, the jobs were given to youth with kharchi and parchi (corruption or recommendation).

NEW DELHI: Total voter turnout in Phase 2 of the ongoing J&K election was 57.3%, higher than the 52.2% polling recorded in 2024 Lok Sabha polls but lower than the 61.8% turnout in 2014 assembly polls as well as 61.4% in Phase 1 of the current poll. Mata Vaishno Devi , a new assembly constituency (AC) carved out in the delimitation exercise of 2022, recorded the highest turnout in Phase 2, at 80.5%, while Habbakadal AC in Srinagar polled a mere 19.8% votes.While the overall female voters’ turnout for Phase 2 polling in J&K, at 56.2%, was 2.1 percentage points less than 58.3% male polling percentage, women’s turnout exceeded that of men in 11 of 26 assembly constituencies that voted on Wednesday. Ten of these 11 constituencies are in Jammu division, while only one — Khansahib — is in Kashmir Valley.Turnouts were higher across the Valley’s Budgam, Ganderbal and Srinagar districts as compared to 2024 LS polls, but significantly lower in Ganderbal and Budgam, when compared with the 2014 assembly polls.

Polling in Rajouri and Poonch was better than in 2024 LS elections, but slightly lower in Reasi. While Reasi, where the decline was the sharpest since 2014, had seen a major terror attack in June with nine persons killed after terrorists fired on a bus, Rajouri and Poonch have seen fierce encounters between the security forces and terrorists in the recent months.The gap between male and female voter turnout was wide in many constituencies of Kashmir region; like, it was over 10.6 percentage points in Zadibal AC, 10.4 in Budgam AC, 9.9 in Lal Chowk AC and 9.6 in Habbakadal AC. Habbakadal by far has recorded the lowest turnout in J&K with a mere 23% of its male electorate and 16.7% of its female electorate turning out to vote. Women voters’ turnout in Eidgah AC and Central Shalteng AC in Srinagar district was lower by almost 8.3 percentage points each.In Jammu, higher participation of women seemed to pushed up the overall turnouts. Barring Mata Vaishno Devi, where female voting percentage was a marginal 0.7 percentage points lower than men’s, ACs in Jammu region saw women voters’ turnout surpass men’s by anything between 4.1 and 11.1 percentage points.

Nandini: A popular household name in South India

Leadership at KMF

The origins of

Karnataka Milk Federation

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India. It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘N andi’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Amul.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113670083,imgsize-28106,width-400,resizemode-4/113670083.jpg"
Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

Tirupati temple row: Why Jagan Reddy’s religion has become a flashpoint in Andhra Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tirupati-temple-row-why-jagan-reddys-religion-has-become-a-flashpoint-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/113742786.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday hit out at CM Chandrababu Naidu and said ""demons are ruling"" the state as he cancelled his visit to Tirumala temple. He said he had ""never seen political parties creating hurdles even to visit a temple"".Reddy cancelled his scheduled visit to Tirumala temple on September 28 amid the adulterated Tirupati laddus row over security concerns and demand for 'declaration of faith'.Claiming that Reddy was a believer of Christianity , TDP had demanded that Jagan Reddy must declare his faith before the temple visit.TDP's allies BJP and Jana Sena also insisted that Reddy declare his faith before entering the Sri Venkateswara temple.Rule 136 of the temple board's guidelines states that only Hindus are allowed to go for darshan. Non-Hindus who wish to have darshan of Lord Venkateswara will have to inform the TTD Board about their religion and have to declare the same in a form as per their conscience only as mentioned in Rule 137.Amid the heat, Reddy finally cancelled his visit which was meant to atone for the ""sin"" allegedly committed by CM Naidu who claimed that animal fat was used in the laddus, part of temple prasadam.""Many questions have been raised about my caste. I read the Bible at home, and I respect and follow Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. I belong to the community of humanity. What does the Constitution say? If a person equivalent to the chief minister is not allowed into the temple, I question how Dalits will be treated,"" he said.This is not the first time Reddy's religion has become a flashpoint in Andhra Pradesh politics. His opponents have time and again used his Christian faith to portray him as 'anti-Hindu'. This is also not the first time Reddy has openly disclosed that he follows Christianity and reads the Bible.In 2019, after a glorious victory in the Lok Sabha elections, as he was asked about Congress and his exit and if he felt vindicated after the results, he said, ""I pray and read my Bible. It is for God to decide.""During his whole tenure as chief minister, he was under constant attack by the opposition as they blamed him for the desecration of temples in Andhra Pradesh and conversions.He was also attacked for several decisions for the Christian community in the state. The Reddy government hiked financial aid to Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem in Israel and other Biblical places. The state-sponsored tour period of the Biblical places was also enhanced from eight to 10 days.In August 2019, Reddy’s trip to Jerusalem which was ""purely personal and the expenditure shall be borne by the dignitary"" was also criticised by the opposition after the Andhra Pradesh government spent Rs 22.5 lakh on it. His government, however, dismissed the charges stating the cost was towards security arrangements.During this time, Naidu's party, which had till now stayed away from communal remarks, also started targeting the Reddy government over temple vandalism incidents and for pushing English medium school education as a ""ploy to spread Christianity"" in the state.Amid huge debate over his religious faith, Reddy's uncle YV Subba Reddy also took over as the 50th chairman of Tirumala trust board in June, 2019.Jagan Reddy, who has visited the hill shrine several times, has always found himself in the middle of the ""declare your faith"" campaign.In September 2020, when as CM he visited Tirupati temple , TDP and BJP renewed their demand that he should sign the declaration.Adding to the fuel, the temple trust chairman had stated at that time that the declaration was not needed for the temple entry of the non-Hindus.Now in 2024, just months after the tables were turned in favor of Chandrababu Naidu and Reddy lost power in Andhra Pradesh, the new CM has attacked the Reddy government by alleging that it allowed the use of animal fat in Tirupati laddus and hurt the sentiments of Hindus across the country.And once again, the ""declare your faith"" attack has come back to haunt Reddy.","Reddy cancelled his scheduled visit to Tirumala temple on September 28 amid the adulterated Tirupati laddus row.

'Belong to community of humanity'

Reddy is anti-Hindu, says TDP spokesperson



Reddy defends ghee tender process



'Adulterated ghee was not used'



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday lashed out at the TDP government in Andhra Pradesh, stating that "" demons are now in power in the state"" as he had ""never seen political parties creating hurdles even to make a visit to a temple"".The former CM launched the attack after he cancelled his trip to Tirumala temple amid the Tirupati laddu row. Reddy was scheduled to reach Tirumala on Friday night and visit the temple for darshan on Saturday.Hours before his departure from Tadepalle to Tirupati, Jagan decided to cancel his trip amid growing demands for giving 'declaration of faith' and security concerns.YSRCP had alleged that the state police, under orders from Chandrababu Naidu and minister Nara Lokesh, had issued warnings to YSRCP leaders ahead of Reddy's visit, instructing them not to participate.After cancelling his trip, Reddy held a press conference in which he said that the cops were ""issuing notices to YSRCP leaders and cadres in the wake of my Tirumala visit"".""Police clearly stated in the notices to YSRCP leaders that visit to Tirumala has no permission ... why do we need police permission to visit Temple?"" Reddy said, adding that ""demons are ruling"" the state.""The demon rule is continuing in the state. The government is trying to obstruct my upcoming visit to the Tirumala temple. Police have issued notices to YSRCP leaders across the state regarding the temple visit. The notice states that the visit to the Tirumala temple is not permitted, and the program organised by YSRCP does not have the necessary approval. Consequently, leaders are not allowed to participate in that programme,"" said the YSRCP chief.""On one side, they are serving notices to obstruct my temple visit, while on the other side, BJP cadres are coming into the state from elsewhere, and a large number of police are deployed at multiple locations. I don't know if the BJP leadership is aware of this. To shift the political focus, CM Chandrababu Naidu has brought up the laddu issue. CM Chandrababu Naidu is portraying that animal fat was used in the laddu prasadam manufacturing, which questions the sanctity and pride of Tirumala. Is this justified? Chandrababu Naidu is blatantly lying on TTD Laddu Prasadam,"" the former chief minister told the media after cancelling his trip.The YSRCP chief had said he would visit the temple on September 28 as part of a statewide temple rituals called for by the party to atone for the 'sin' allegedly committed by CM Naidu through his allegations on Tirupati laddus.""What happened during the so-called controversy on Laddus? TTD's reputation has been lowered by Chandrababu Naidu. The pride of our Laddus was diminished by Chandrababu Naidu. He intentionally planted a seed of doubt that the Laddus were not good to eat, even though he knew very well that he was lying,"" said Reddy.On the matter of 'declaration of faith', Reddy said CM Naidu had come up with 'faith declaration' issue to divert attention from failure to convince people on Tirupati laddu quality.He further said: ""Many questions have been raised about my caste. I read the Bible at home, and I respect and follow Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. I belong to the community of humanity. What does the Constitution say? If a person equivalent to the Chief Minister is not allowed into the temple, I question how Dalits will be treated.""Reacting to Reddy's charges, TDP national spokesperson Pattabhi Ram Kommareddy, said: ""By cancelling his trip to Tirumala, Jagan Reddy has once again proved that he is anti-Hindu. The only thing that he had to do to have a darshan of Lord Balaji was to sign a declaration, which is a rule in TTD for more than three decades. Any person belonging to a religion other than Hindu is supposed to sign a small declaration and he has to take permission from the concerned authority to have a darshan of Lord Balaji. So what problem does Jagan Reddy have in signing this declaration? Even people like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who visited Tirmala as President of this country had signed this declaration because he is a Muslim. Many other eminent leaders in our country have done this... Without having faith and reverence towards Lord Balaji, What will you do by having a darshan of the deity? What kind of drama are you trying to play, Jagan Reddy? On one hand, you say that you'll have the darshan of Lord Balaji and pray for forgiveness for what had happened. It is an unforgivable sin. Lord Balaji will never forgive you.""Defending the ghee procuring process, Reddy said: ""CM Chandrababu Naidu is telling lies. The ghee procurement e-tender is a routine process that has been happening for decades, every 6 months. Tirupati Laddu is very special. Since my childhood, I know that it is very special. The tender process takes place every 6 months, it's a routine. It has been happening for years. Anyone who qualifies can participate.""""Every 6 months, tenders (for Laddu) are called and the one who quotes for lower prices, gets approved by the TTD board. There is no government interference. The TTD board is also very special. Union Ministers and other state CMs also recommend the board members. The tenders of TTD were called as per routine and the suppliers were given as per the tender auction. TTD has a robust mechanism. The tankers that come to Thirumala should have an NABL certificate. The suppliers should get the tankers certified and produce the certificate,"" said the former CM.""During Chandrababu Naidu regime from 2014 to 2019 nearly 14-15 times, the ghee was rejected due to quality issues. There is a robust process. Similarly from 2019 to 2024, 18 times it was rejected and sent back. Whatever I am saying is all facts,"" Reddy added.""Four tankers failed the test in July during Chandrababu Naidu's regime in 2024. The samples from those tankers should have been sent to CFTRI Mysore, but instead, they were sent to NDDB in Gujarat for the first time. TTD issued a show-cause notice to the company responsible for the refused tankers. The refused tanker material was not used by TTD, yet Chandrababu Naidu claims that adulterated ghee was used. I question how adulterated ghee could have been used in prasad manufacturing if the tankers were sent back?"" Reddy said.""The TTD Executive Officer, recruited by Chandrababu Naidu, confirmed on July 23 that vegetable fat oil that is Vanaspati Oil was involved and a show-cause notice was issued to the suppliers. The TTD EO later confirmed on September 20 that adulterated ghee was not used for making Laddu prasadam.

NEW DELHI: UK prime minister Keir Starmer has added his voice to a growing chorus for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ).""We want to see permanent African representation on the Council, Brazil, India, Japan and Germany as permanent members, and more seats for elected members as well,"" Starmer said in his address to the 79th session of the UN General Assembly held in New York.Emphasising the need for the UNSC to evolve into a more representative body that can effectively address global challenges without being hindered by political paralysis, the UK PM said: ""If we want the system to deliver for the poorest and most vulnerable then their voices must be heard. We need to make the system more representative and more responsive to those who need it most. So we will make the case not just for fairer outcomes, but fairer representation in how we reach them. And this also applies to the Security Council. It has to change to become a more representative body, willing to act – not paralysed by politics.""Promising to change how the UK does things, Starmer said: ""UK will move away from the paternalism of the past towards partnership for the future. Listening a lot more – speaking a bit less. Offering game-changing British expertise and working together in a spirit of equal respect.""Starmer's strong support for India's bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC follows similar endorsements from leaders of the United States andFrance .The UK PM's remarks align with a growing consensus among several countries advocating for reforms in the UNSC, which has remained largely unchanged since its establishment in 1945.Currently, the UNSC consists of five permanent members — namely the United States, China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom — who hold veto power over substantive resolutions. The council also includes ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.Starmer highlighted that the inclusion of nations like India, Brazil, Japan, and Germany as permanent members would enhance the council's legitimacy and effectiveness.French president Emmanuel Macron had voiced similar sentiments just days prior, stating that an expanded UNSC is essential for improving its efficiency and representation. He called for permanent seats for India, Brazil, Japan, and Germany, alongside two representatives from Africa.This push for reform has been echoed by US President Joe Biden, who also recognised India's significant role on the global stage during recent discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.India has long argued that it deserves a permanent seat at the UNSC due to its growing geopolitical influence and contributions to global peacekeeping efforts.India last served as a non-permanent member from 2021 to 2022 and continues to advocate for reforms that reflect contemporary geopolitical realities.The recent endorsements from major powers like the UK, US, and France mark a significant step towards achieving this long-sought goal, as they collectively call for a reformed UNSC that better represents today's world dynamics.","UK PM Keir Starmer has added his voice to a growing chorus for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

CHANDIGARH: Reprimanding Punjab government for not releasing funds to private hospitals under Ayushman Bharat despite receiving Rs 350 crore from Centre, Punjab and Haryana HC has ordered salaries of senior functionaries, including Kumar Rahul, Punjab health department principal secretary, to be attached.The HC observed that state govt, having received money for a specified purpose, is a custodian of the money and must release i t only to actual beneficiaries.It cannot be permitted to retain the amount, leaving citizens litigating for their dues, and misappropriate the grants at the cost of the actual recipient, the HC said.The petitioners had approached HC seeking release of their pending dues. The empanelled hospitals admit patients under the scheme and raise claims for medical expenses with state health agency under Punjab govt’s department of health and family welfare.“Ordinarily, such action would call for stern orders against erring officials who misdirected funds for unauthorised use. However, before proposing any action, it is deemed expedient to seek a detailed response from the state on financial reimbursement received by it from Centre from Dec 2021 until now and how that money has been utilised,” the HC order said, seeking an affidavit from Punjab within two weeks.“The affidavit shall also inform whether the amount received could be used for the said purposes (for which the amount has been utilised) or not,” the order added. It also asked Punjab to provide details of payments made against bills from Dec 30, 2021 to Sept 24, 2024 along with date on which such payment was released.","HC orders salaries of senior functionaries, including Kumar Rahul, Punjab health department principal secretary, to be attached.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday chided the Maharashtra administration for its failure to fully carry out its July 31 instructions to transfer all poll-related officers who have completed three years in a posting or are posted in their home districts, while ordering immediate compliance.Sources in the commission told TOI that over 100 inspector-level officers in Mumbai and several revenue officials holding key positions in the state, who fulfil the criteria laid down in EC’s guidelines on mandatory pre-poll transfers, have not been transferred despite the poll panel’s having sought a compliance report from the Maharashtra chief secretary and DGP by August 20, followed by reminders sent on Aug 22, Sept 11 and Sept 25.The non-compliance, it is suspected, could be a deliberate attempt on part of the state administration to retain officers “friendly to the ruling dispensation”, with the assembly poll process expected to kick in by October second week.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar , who is on a visit to Maharashtra along with fellow commissioners Gyanesh Kunar and S S Sandhu, expressed his displeasure over the state administration's non-compliance, stating that the delay undermines efforts to ensure a free and fair electoral process.Seeking an explanation from the Maharashtra chief secretary and DGP on why the process of relocate officials eligible for mandatory pre-poll transfers has not been completed, with no response in from the chief secretary yet and only a partial compliance update submitted by the additional DGP on Sept 13, EC on Friday said further inaction in the matter shall not be tolerated.In a communication sent to Maharashtra chief secretary on Friday, EC reminded the former that it had directed him and the state DGP to submit a compliance report of its instructions on pre-poll transfers, complete with details of action obtained from the concerned departments and offices, by Aug 20.“Despite the above directions, no report was received from the chief secretary and DGP till the due date. Reminders were issued vide the Commission's letter of even number on 22.08.2024, 11.09.2024 and 25.09.2024, directing thereby to furnish the reports urgently,” the EC underlined.The poll panel stated that while the Maharashtra chief electoral officer (CEO) had forwarded a letter from addl DGP dated Sept 13 regarding partial compliance, “no report has been received in the commission from the chief secretary till date”.Directing that its instructions on transfers be immediately and fully complied with, EC called for an explanation from the chief secretary and DGP as to why the compliance reports were not furnished even after the lapse of stipulated time limit and despite the reminders.","The Election Commission (EC) on Friday chided the Maharashtra administration for its failure to fully carry out its July 31 instructions to transfer all poll- related officers.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday directed police to identify a secluded spot for the burial of the body of Akshay Shinde , accused in the Badlapur sexual assault case , who was killed in a police shootout . A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and M M Sathaye said once the spot is identified, police shall inform Shinde’s family members about it so that the burial can be done.HC rejected the contention of the prosecution that there is no custom of burying bodies in Shinde’s community, calling it his parents’ choice.Shinde’s father on Friday moved an urgent application seeking a burial spot for his son. The father said they were unable to find a burial ground for Shinde.Public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar told the court that all burial grounds in Badlapur and neighbouring areas have refused and opposed the burial of Shinde. Police would take steps to identify a secluded spot for the burial, Venegaonkar told the court.He added police will also ensure that no untoward incident occurs.“The family will be informed about the same. But they need not make an event out of it. Let them do it silently. The family members will be taken (to burial spot) with police staff,” Venegaonkar said.The bench accepted the statement and posted the matter for hearing on September 30.Venegaonkar further said police had enquired and found out that there was no such custom of burying in Shinde’s community. “Our enquiry has found that there is no such custom of burial. The family’s lawyer made a comment that they are burying only so that there is the option of exhumation in future. All senior members of their community themselves have said there is no such custom,” the Public prosecutor said.The bench, however, said the community will not decide what the parents want.“Nobody has the right to decide. It is the parents’ choice,” HC said.The father’s advocate Amit Katarnaware told the high court the family had identified a spot and had also sought permission from the Ambernath Municipal Council. He further alleged the family was facing threats. The court said they could lodge a complaint with the police which would look into the same.","HC rejected the contention of the prosecution that there is no custom of burying bodies in Shinde’s community, calling it his parents’ choice.

LVIV: Yevhen Pramonov, a member of a Ukrainian special forces battalion, lost his legs while clearing mines in Donetsk region last Dec. Working non-stop for 24 days at the time, he had stepped on a Russian mine, triggering an explosion that left him critically injured. Evacuated amid heavy gunfire, he survived thanks to first aid and, later, the expertise of the Superhumans Centre in Lviv.The centre, launched after the full-scale Russian invasion, has become alifeline for soldiers and civilians alike. Specialising in prosthetics , mental health support, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation, it has treated more than 625 people and provided 850 prosthetic limbs.But its success would have been difficult without Aether Biomedical, a company founded by two Indian innovators which has provided advanced bionic arms for soldiers. So far, Aether Biomedical has supplied 70 bionic arms to amputees at the centre.Aether Biomedical is a Polish company founded by Dhruv Agrawal and Faith Jiwakhan , both from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College, New Delhi. Their journey into prosthetic innovation began when they met a man born without a limb and lacking access to functional prosthetics.Determined to make a difference, they created the prototype for a bionic hand, ‘Zeus’, in a small room during their first year of medical school. The company focuses on developing advanced, multifunctional prosthetic hands activated by the user’s muscle signals.Dhruv explains: “Our prosthetics use electrodes connected to the user’s muscles to transmit signals to an algorithm, which then converts the signals into precise movements.” The prosthetics are 3D printed, remotely configurable, and locally repairable — a precious feature for Ukrainians who require maintenance in a war-torn country. Agrawal notes that with the conflict intensifying, there is “a pressing need for prosthetics as thousands have been forced to undergo amputations”.Dhruv adds: “Usually, bionic hands are weak, break easily, and take forever to repair. Our arm is the strongest in the world. It has a gripping capacity of 35kg, damage-resistant fingers designed to withstand the impact of daily life, and it can be repaired locally rather than being sent back to the manufacturer.”According to Dr Jiwakhan, the arm uses web-based software to make remote adjustments: “We have developed a digital platform for the ‘Zeus’ hand that connects clinicians and patients through a cloudbased mobile app. Clinicians can remotely configure the prosthetic, monitor device usage and make real-time adjustments. This ensures patients receive end-to-end support throughout their journey.”“I was bleeding heavily after the blast,” Yevhen recalls. “When I woke up in hospital, I knew my life had changed, but Ialso knew I wanted to keep serving my country.” Yevhen, now, after receiving bionic limbs, plans to return to the armed forces to deliver lectures at a military academy.Superhumans Centre offers prosthetic limbs free of charge, and is funded by international organisations. A mechanical knee prosthesis can range from euro 18,000 to 20,000, while a below-the-knee prosthesis costs about euro 9,000. More advanced myoelectric hands, like ‘Zeus’, cost between euro 15,000 and 50,000.","A Polish company founded by two Indians is providing advanced bionic arms for soldiers and civilians alike.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday accused India of “massive expansion of its military capabilities” and issuing threats to cross the LoC for taking over Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, as he raised the Kashmir issue again in his UNGA address. He demanded that New Delhi reverse the 2019 abrogation of Article 370.Pakistan routinely raises the Kashmir issue at the annual UN debate.India is expected to exercise its right of reply to counter Sharif’s allegations.Sharif said “like the people of Palestine”, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have “struggled for a century for their freedom and right to self-determination”.He said the escalation of Islamophobia was a troubling global development. “The most alarming manifestation of Islamophobia is the Hindu supremacist agenda in India. It aggressively seeks the subjugation of 200 million Muslims and the obliteration of India's Islamic heritage,” he claimed.“Even more worryingly,” he said, India “is engaged in massive expansion of its military capabilities which are essentially deployed against Pakistan”. Its war doctrines envisage a surprise attack and a limited war under the nuclear overhang, he said, adding that India had spurned his country’s proposal for a mutual strategic restraint regime, and its leadership has “often threatened to cross the Line of Control” and take over what Pakistan refers to as “Azad Kashmir”.",Pakistan routinely raises the Kashmir issue at the annual UN debate.

Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an “India Out” agenda, asserting that the island nation had a “serious problem” with the presence of foreign military on its soil.Muizzu, who is in the US to attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, made the remarks on Thursday while responding to a question at Princeton University’s “Dean’s Leadership Series”.“We have never been against any one country at any point. It’s not ‘India Out’. Maldives faced a serious problem with foreign military presence on this soil,” Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com quoted him as saying. “The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country,” he said.Ties between India and Maldives came under severe strain since November last year when Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as Maldivian president. Muizzu had asked India to withdraw nearly 90 Indian military personnel operating three aviation platforms gifted by the country. India withdrew its military personnel by May 10 and replaced them with civilian personnel to operate a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters.Muizzu further stressed he had taken action against deputy ministers for insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media. “No one should say such a thing. I took action against it. I will not accept insulting anyone like that, whether he is a leader or an ordinary person. Every human being has a reputation,” the report quoted him as saying.Earlier this year, deputy ministers in Maldives’ youth ministry were suspended for derogatory social media posts against Modi following a backlash, with New Delhi strongly raising the matter with Male. The deputy ministers criticised Modi for his post on X following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives. Modi was in Lakshadweep on Jan2 and 3 to inaugurate several projects.",Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an “India Out’ agenda.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said it will examine the serious allegations of Enforcement Directorate and Chhattisgarh govt that Nagarik Apurti Nigam (NAN or PDS) scam accused ex-bureaucrats Anil K Tuteja and Alok Shukla allegedly influenced a HC judge for getting anticipatory bail.A bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih repeatedly asked additional solicitor general S V Raju for evidence on two counts - whether the ex-bureaucrats have misused the bail granted to them to tamper with evidence and for allegedly influencing the HC judge for getting pre-arrest bail in the scam.Raju said the evidence was filed in a sealed cover by the ED but the bench was unable to trace it. Raju offered to file it afresh. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Chhattisgarh govt, said the state in its affidavits have annexed details of WhatsApp chats to show the nexus between the ex-bureaucrats, the then advocate general of the state and the judge.Appearing for the accused, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said Chhattisgarh govt has no role in the case as it was between the accused and the ED and wondered why it has filed the affidavit in the case.Jethmalani said the then AG of the state had participated in the perpetration of the fraud and facilitated grant of bail in subversion of established judicial process. Rohatgi said these affidavits are meaningless in the proceedings pending before the court as the ED is seeking shifting of the trial of the case outside the state.While posting next hearing in the case to Nov 8, the bench said it must examine the evidence furnished by the ED and state govt on the alleged nexus between the accused, former AG and the judge.""We will examine it as the charge is against the judicial system,"" the bench said.

PUNE: Senior economist Bibek Debroy , in an email and a letter sent to Pune-based Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) vice-chancellor Ajit Ranade , has said that he was ""standing down with immediate effect"" as chancellor of the institute on ""moral"" grounds.The two communications on Sept 26 by Debroy, who is also chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, came the day the Bombay high court extended an ad interim relief to Ranade by allowing the latter to continue as V-C till Oct 7.Ranade confirmed to TOI that he has received the email but preferred not to elaborate on the grounds that his petition challenging his removal as V-C was pending before the high court.In another letter to the University Grants Commission (UGC) chairman Jagadesh Kumar on Sept 26, Debroy has said, ""The Bombay high court has granted Dr Ajit Ranade a stay. In my view, Gokhale Institute of Politics & Economics now stands in direct violation to UGC stipulations on deemed universities. It is for you and UGC to decide on how you will act on the matter. As for me, since the stay obtained by Dr Ajit Ranade violates my order, I have decided to step down as chancellor of GIPE with immediate effect.""Milind Deshmukh, secretary of the Servants of India Society, which runs GIPE, a deemed university, told TOI, ""In the email sent to Ranade, Debroy has said that the V-C has asserted in his petition that the chancellor did not apply his mind, and that the court's relief vindicated the V-C's position. Debroy has said that under the circumstances, he has no moral right to continue as chancellor of GIPE and was standing down with immediate effect. He has asked the V-C to inform the board of management and everyone else who needed to be informed. He said he would not attend GIPE's convocation on Oct 5 as he was stepping down with immediate effect.""On Sept 14, Debroy had issued an order removing Ranade from the V-C's post based on a three-member fact-finding committee's report concluding that Ranade's appointment was not legally tenable as he does not fulfil the criteria of 10 years of experience as a professor to be appointed as a V-C. UGC norms state that the chancellor can remove the vice-chancellor after his appointment on grounds of incapacity, misrepresentation or violation of regulations.On June 27, the then chancellor Rajiv Kumar had issued a show cause notice to Ranade for not meeting the eligibility criteria following a complaint lodged by former faculty of Gokhale Institute, Murali Krishna.On Ranade's request, Debroy had allowed him to continue as V-C till Sept 21 to complete certain formalities. Ranade then moved the HC challenging his removal and sought his reinstatement.","Senior economist Bibek Debroy has said that he was ""standing down with immediate effect"" as chancellor of Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics.
