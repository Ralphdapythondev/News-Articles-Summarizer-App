"'We don’t support neo-Nazis, Indians are welcome in Germany'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/germany-we-do-not-support-neo-nazis-indians-are-welcome/articleshow/114607062.cms,"Leif-Erik Holm from AfD addresses misconceptions about his party's stance on immigration, emphasizing a conservative-liberal approach welcoming skilled workers, including Indians. Holm criticized Germany's uncontrolled migration, highlighting the need for regulated, law-abiding immigrants. AfD aims to enhance Germany's economic attractiveness through lower taxes, investment in infrastructure, and reduced bureaucracy while ensuring cultural integration.

Germany’s most controversial rightwing party, Alternative for

Germany

(AfD)

was invited to accompany Chancellor Scholz’s ongoing visit to India. But

Leif-Erik

Holm

,

Opposition Member of the Bundestag and AfD’s economic advisor, had to pull out due to illness. In an exclusive interview to

Padma

Rao Sundarji

from Germany for

Times of India Online,

Holm talked about why AfD’s popularity is growing so rapidly, Germany’s problem with illegal immigration, its good experience with migrants from India and why his country needs Indians so urgently.

Leif-Erik Holm, your party is described as a “far-right”, “right-wing” and “populist” in the mainstream media around the world, including in India. They say your party opposes the migration of foreigners to Germany, especially of Muslims. Is that a fair description of AfD, or do you want to offer a better one?

Your party was democratically elected to three crucial Länder (state) parliaments in eastern Germany earlier this year. We assume there was no rigging of the vote. Yet, other parties refuse to form coalitions with AfD. In fact, they want the AfD banned. Interestingly, even Germany’s Central Council of Jews spoke against any such ban. Why are you hated so much, both by the German media as well as all mainstream political parties?

In February 2024, there were around 137,000 Indians working in skilled positions in Germany. Chancellor Scholz and a huge delegation are here to attract more Indian IT engineers, nurses and caregivers to migrate to Germany. But many Indians fear racism, specifically at the hands of the AfD, and the neo-Nazi groups who claim to be your supporters and enjoy your support too. Indians have been attacked by such goons. What is your party’s stand on Indian migration to Germany ?

The world’s third largest Muslim population lives in India. Among the talent Germany seeks, are many highly educated Indian Muslims too. But some Indian Muslims are conservative, even wear the

hijab.

There are no problems in India -it is viewed as their choice. But given the AfD’s reluctance to allow conservative Muslims into your country, how will you tackle this conundrum? Surely a democracy like Germany can’t screen applications by religion?

Set aside the liberal media. There are dozens of personal accounts on Youtube by young Indians in Germany. They say they don’t feel culturally accepted, that they often get racial slurs hurled at them, that people -especially in eastern Germany -expect them to speak perfect German -which takes at least a decade to learn, that they get sidelined in favour of white English job-seekers, even for jobs that require English. What do you say to them?

As an economist yourself, why do you think Germany, an industrial giant and an economic superpower, is in such bad shape today?

It was German Economics Minister

Robert Habeck

(Green Party) who invited you to come along to India – specifically to attend the to Asia Pacific Conference of German businesses (APK) in New Delhi. You have lampooned Mr Habeck’s economic policies fiercely. Is that the real reason why you stayed home ? Surely Germany’s economic crisis cannot be attributed to Germany’s current coalition government alone?

You have also criticized the German government’s proposal to lower taxes for foreign migrants. Perhaps this is intended to make migration to Germany even more attractive. So if AfD, too, wants more Indian migrants, why are you slamming this incentive?

What do you think Mr Habeck should focus on while here, given Germany’s interest in both Indian migration, but also in selling in products – especially weapons – to India?

What are your closing words for thousands of Indians who are still streaming to relatively safe and well-known domains like the United States? How will you encourage them to come to Germany instead ? And should migrating Indians do, to ‘integrate’ successfully into German society?

Holm: The labels that are attached to my party are just as inaccurate as the claim that the AfD generally rejects the immigration of foreigners. We are a conservative party with a strong liberal orientation. What we reject is unrestricted illegal immigration, which completely overburdens our country, our society and our social systems. On the other hand, anyone who comes to us legally, integrates, provides for themselves and contributes to Germany's prosperity, is welcome.Holm: The AfD is a thorn in the side of established parties and the mainstream media, because they fear for their positions and their money pots. They are afraid of losing the power they believed to be secure. And rightly so. Because the citizens are voting for us out of conviction, because they want a different policy that finally puts their concerns at the centre of action. A policy that takes care of the interests of its own citizens first. The AfD does that, and that is precisely why more and more people are voting for us.Holm: The AfD does not support neo-Nazi groups and is not supported by such groups. These are simply malicious claims that have no basis whatsoever. Let me make this clear: We are a conservative-liberal party; there is no room for extremists in our organisation. Genuinely skilled workers are very welcome here, whether in the service sector, the IT industry, the nursing sector or elsewhere. Germany has had good experiences with the immigration of skilled labour from India so far. On average, they are well educated (16 per cent specialist level, 37 per cent expert level) and have a low unemployment rate (3.7 per cent). The fear of racism is unfounded and is probably due to the distorted picture painted by some left-leaning media. On the other hand, real skilled workers are put off by the high tax and duty burden in Germany, the bureaucracy, the housing shortage, the deteriorating education system and the growing crime rate as a result of uncontrolled mass migration from the Arab and African regions.Holm: The free practice of religion is a fundamental right in Germany and applies to all people. But of course we also have a guiding culture that defines our country. And that is not Muslim. We expect immigrants from other cultures to accept and adapt to our values and not try to impose their culture on us. Of course, Muslims are free to wear a headscarf. But women must not be forced to do so, and such a religious symbol has no place in the civil service either. Nobody is forced to eat pork in our country, but it is also not acceptable for Muslims to demand a ban on pork for all pupils in cafeterias, for example, or that Christian festivals should no longer be celebrated. If you want to live according to the principles of Sharia law, you have to immigrate to a country where it applies. In Germany, the Basic Law applies.Holm: That the reticence with which some citizens in Germany react to immigrants from other cultures is not automatically meant in a derogatory way. Germany isn’t a classic immigration country like the USA, for example, and so it sometimes takes a little longer for people to warm up to each other. The main problem, however, is that Germans have had bad experiences with uncontrolled mass migration. There are too many illegal immigrants who become criminals and commit the most serious crimes. There are gang rapes, gang crime, drug crime, and the perpetrators are mostly foreigners. This naturally gives rise to prejudices, from which even the righteous immigrants suffer. It was and is a serious mistake on the part of former Chancellor Angela Merkel and now Chancellor Olaf Scholz , to allow this to go on for years. We need to control and regulate immigration. This will also facilitate the integration of those immigrants who abide by the law, who are hard-working and who contribute to society.Holm: The German government's disastrous economic policy has led to Germany being the only leading industrialised nation with no economic growth. We are in recession for the second year in a row. We are the sick man of Europe. Meanwhile, everyone else around us is growing, everyone else is coping better with the same problems such as the consequences of the war in Ukraine, the coronavirus crisis and the global market. This shows that our weakness is home-made. We have far too high a tax and duty burden, a non-functioning energy transition has caused energy prices to explode and made us uncompetitive. Bureaucracy is overburdening companies and citizens, the costs of the social systems are out of control, which is why there is a lack of investment in infrastructure and digitalisation. All of this has led to more and more companies in Germany giving up, or moving abroad, where they find better framework conditions.Holm: We, in AfD, are in favour of the social market economy that has made our country great, while Mr Habeck is a friend of the planned economy. We think that the economy needs freedom. Mr Habeck is in favour of redistribution and would rather put companies on a leash. But no, that doesn’t stop us from getting on a plane together. I would have loved to be there -unfortunately, I fell ill.Holm: The planned tax rebate for foreign skilled workers is a slap in the face for all hard-working citizens in Germany. We cannot degrade the many Germans who get up early every day and work for far too little net income, to second-class taxpayers. That is absurd. We say that relief is needed, but for everyone.Holm: Mr Habeck should make it clear that we are a reliable trading partner whose products stand for the highest quality. And that both Germany and India benefit from close economic relations. Mr Habeck should act accordingly, as a trading partner and not as a teacher. The economy must take centre stage, not green climate ideology.Holm: Germany is a great country that is unfortunately currently badly governed. We as the AfD want to change this and ensure that Germany becomes attractive and strong again. For German citizens, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently emigrating, and also for real skilled workers from abroad. This means lower duties and taxes, especially on energy, more investment in infrastructure and digitalisation and a consistent reduction in bureaucracy. We want to make Germany fit again as a business location. And anyone who wants to lend a hand is welcome.","Leif-Erik Holm from AfD addresses misconceptions about his party's stance on immigration, emphasizing a conservative-liberal approach welcoming skilled workers.

"On Finding Dignity in Defeat, Humility in Victory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-finding-dignity-in-defeat-humility-in-victory/articleshow/114589679.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world

lessons

from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

After Abdul Kalam, it was probably Ratan Tata ’s passing that stirred the nation to this extent. Two days after his demise, I was journeying through a small city, where I was struck by the sight of giant hoardings displaying Tata's ever-smiling face. The people mourned not just the loss of a business tycoon, but of a man whose humility and benevolence touched lives.Much has been written and spoken about Ratan Tata’s humility, courtesy, and gentle nature. I was a witness myself. During the mid-90s, I often travelled to my bank’s branch in Mumbai. On one such occasion, I noticed Ratan Tata standing in the long queue before a teller. I went to the branch manager to report the visit of the VIP, but was told Tata would deny any special treatment. I was left speechless, having witnessed many customers preferring special treatment at all times.Amidst such people, Tata stood out. He progressed through the queue, exchanged pleasantries with other customers and the teller, and left after his transaction was completed.Tata’s life was filled with moments where he prioritised what truly mattered. In February 2018, Prince Charles wished to honour the tycoon with a lifetime achievement award for philanthropy at Buckingham Palace. Tata accepted the invitation but later informed the prince that he would not be attending. One of his beloved dogs, either Tango or Tito, was gravely ill. His priorities were clear, and he was unapologetic about them.But there is more to his story than humility—he also knew how to rise above challenges, even in the face of humiliation.It was the year 1999, and Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle division was performing poorly, leading the company to consider selling it to Ford Motors. Ratan Tata, along with his senior leadership team, travelled to Detroit to negotiate the deal. However, the meeting took a sour turn when Ford executives reportedly scorned Tata's foray into the car business. The team returned without the deal.And yet, from that moment, Tata Motors rose like a phoenix. A decade later, in a stunning turn of events, Tata acquired Ford’s Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) for $2.3 billion, and Bill Ford, chairman, acknowledged it as a significant deal for JLR.Humiliations, like demons, often burrow into our soul, gnawing at our confidence. The only true way to banish them is through growth—rising above the circumstances and the people who caused the hurt. But in doing so, one must rise with grace, so that even those who wronged us may benefit from our success.I have always imagined Valluvar’s best lines came through a dialogue between him and his disciples. I pictured a scene at his gurukulam. A disciple asked, “Master, how should we conduct ourselves when we stand tall before others? And when we feel small before them?” Valluvar replied, “When life graces you with wealth, power, and fame, remain humble and simple. Avoid pomp and vanity. But when life humbles you with failure, stand tall with dignity .”Perukaththu Vendum Panidhal Siriya Surukaththu Vendum Uyarvu.Cultivate modesty in the days of prosperity, but in the day of decline hold fast to thy dignity.I observed that nature too gives us the same lesson. Trees laden with fruits have their branches bent towards the ground, while the ones without them have branches pointing to the sky. Tata’s life exemplified this.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece 'Thirukkural' written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar.

Canada refuses NIA’s request for death certificate of Nijjar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-refuses-nias-request-for-death-certificate-of-nijjar/articleshow/114599015.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ottawa has refused to entertain the National Investigation Agency’s request for the death certificate of pro-Khalistan operative Hardeep Singh Nijjar , an Indian-origin citizen of Canada who was killed there in June last year. Nijjar was accused in nine cases being investigated by NIA NIA had approached Canada for Nijjar’s death certificate to fulfil the legal requirement of updating the courts here in view of the cases that were pending against him. However, as per NIA sources, the Canadian authorities posed some counter-queries, including why the death certificate of its citizen should be sought by India. “After that, they refused to share his death certificate,” said an officer.Nijjar’s murder had triggered a diplomatic row with the Canadian govt alleging the role of Indian agencies, a charge promptly and stoutly denied by New Delhi. The row had recently escalated with Canada naming senior Indian diplomats as “persons of interest” in the Nijjar murder investigation, and India retaliating by withdrawing those diplomats from the country.NIA is also yet to succeed in securing an Interpol red-corner notice against another pro-Khalistan rabble rouser and designated terrorist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is a US citizen. NIA is investigating six cases of Khalistani terror against Pannun and has attached three of his properties — across Chandigarh, Amritsar and Pathankot — so far on grounds of being proceeds of terrorism. Interestingly, there was an attempt on Pannun’s life in the US in New York in June 2023, prompting the US to claim the involvement of an Indian official.Last week, an unsealed indictment showed that the US had charged Vikash Yadav, described as a former officer in India’s Research and Analysis Wing spy service, with directing the plot against the Sikh separatist.","NIA had approached Canada for Nijjar’s death certificate to fulfil the legal requirement of updating the courts here in view of the cases that were pending against him.

"Coordinated patrols by Army, PLA set to begin by October-end",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coordinated-patrols-by-army-pla-set-to-begin-by-october-end/articleshow/114598258.cms,"NEW DELHI: With around 50% of troop disengagement completed at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh by Friday evening, the Indian Army plans to start “coordinated patrolling” with the People’s Liberation Army in the two areas by this month-end, even as talks are underway on other issues like the ‘buffer zones’ created earlier in the high-altitude region.“The disengagement in Depsang and Demchok will finish by Oct 28-29 if all goes as per the plan finalised by the Indian and Chinese tactical commanders. The coordinated patrolling from the two sides, with prior intimation to each other to avoid face-offs, will then begin after mutual verification,” an Army source said.The ongoing dismantling of the temporary posts, sheds, tents and other structures and pullback of the rival troops in Depsang and Demchok to pre-April 2020 positions are being closely monitored on the ground as well as through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other means.As part of the confidence-building measures, the two sides will share their “patrolling routines” with each other and limit the number to 15-20 armed soldiers in each patrol.India’s push for de-escalation along the entire 3,488km line of actual control (LAC) and de-induction of the over 1,00,000 troops forward deployed by each side is still a long way off.A tactical gain, however, is that the new pact on “patrolling arrangements” at the two remaining face-off sites, first announced by foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Oct 21 after diplomatic and military talks that paved the way for the Modi-Xi meeting, does not include no-patrol buffer zones set up in the earlier rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022.Those buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, are largely on what India considers to be its own territory.“We did not want buffer zones at Depsang and Demchok, with their consequent restrictions on patrolling. The resumption of patrolling in the buffer zones is being separately discussed,” another source said.Under the new pact, the rival troops at Depsang and Demchok will fall back to the positions they held before April 2020, which is when the PLA made multiple well-planned incursions into eastern Ladakh. “The two sides will also patrol the areas they used to patrol till April 2020,” the source said.Consequently, Chinese troops will no longer block Indian soldiers from going to their traditional patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 at the strategically located Depsang Plains, like they were doing around 18km inside Indian territory in the ‘Bottleneck’ area for the last four-and-a-half years.Indian troops should also get access to two crucial PPs in the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok, while Indian shepherds will also be able to take their animals to traditional grazing grounds there. It, of course, remains to be seen whether all this will work on the ground.There are also concerns about whether a “package deal” has been worked out with China that links the new Depsang-Demchok pact with certain “sensitive” areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh.Asked about this, an official source said, “The new pact is only about Depsang-Demchok. But talks are going on in all sectors of the LAC.” While the Yangtse plateau in the crucial Tawang sector has for long been a major flashpoint, PLA troops had tried to transgress across the LAC there to unilaterally change status quo, which had led to a major physical clash between the rival troops on Dec 9, 2022, leaving several injured on both sides.",50% of troop disengagement completed at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh.

Varanasi court rejects plea for excavation survey at Gyanvapi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/varanasi-court-rejects-plea-for-excavation-survey-at-gyanvapi/articleshow/114598370.cms,"VARANASI: A fast-track court in Varanasi rejected Friday a Hindu plaintiff’s plea for an “additional” survey by ASI of the Gyanvapi mosque complex, using invasive methods to gain access to purportedly razed remains of an ancient Adi Vishweshwar temple believed to exist beneath the central dome.Civil judge (senior division) Yughul Shambhu cited directives from Supreme Court and Allahabad high court barring any excavation during the previous survey by ASI of “Plot No 9130” within the Gyanvapi complex.“Based on the facts and circumstances, it can be concluded that the report submitted by ASI is yet to be examined. Secondly, the structure where a ‘ Shivling ’ is stated to have been found is protected by an order of Supreme Court,” Shambhu said.The fast-track court reserved its order during the previous hearing on Oct 19 after Anjuman Intizamia Masajid, the mosque’s custodian, filed objections to advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi’s petition seeking another survey by ASI.Rastogi, who identifies himself as “next friend of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar” in the original Dec 2019 plea for a survey to find out if the mosque was built over a demolished shrine, told reporters that he would appeal Friday’s ruling in the high court.Gyanvapi is embroiled in multiple litigations, including the Shringar Gauri case filed in Aug 2021 by five women plaintiffs seeking unrestricted access to the mosque complex for daily worship of “visible and invisible” Hindu deities there.Two previous surveys of the complex, one by a team constituted by the civil judge’s court and the second by ASI, have yielded purported findings that the Hindu side insists are proof of the existence of a temple.The first court-mandated survey in May 2022 revealed the “Shivling” in the middle of the wuzukhana, or ablution pond. The then civil judge ordered that the pond area be sealed, while allowing namaz to continue. The same month, SC ordered status quo on the dispute and steps to protect the pond area. The apex court also transferred the case to the district judge’s court.On July 23 last year, the district judge asked ASI to conduct a scientific survey of Gyanvapi in response to a plea from the plaintiffs in the Shringar Gauri suit. The survey was to cover the entire premises, barring the sealed wuzukhana zone, to “determine if the mosque had been constructed over the pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple”.ASI submitted its report in a sealed envelope on Dec 18 last year, but it wasn’t opened until Jan 24. The fast-track court, which was separately hearing Rastogi’s plea for a survey of Gyanvapi, directed him to procure a copy of the ASI report before reworking his plea.In compliance with the Dec 30 order, Rastogi submitted a fresh plea in Feb with references to the ASI report. He sought excavation of a trench to gain access to the purported sanctum sanctorum of the ancient temple that is presumed to have been demolished to build the existing mosque.Rastogi contends that the shrine below the central dome houses a towering “Shivling” and an artesian well.AIM and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board filed their objections against Rastogi’s plea on various grounds.",A fast-track court in Varanasi rejected Friday a Hindu plaintiff’s plea for an ‘additional’ survey by ASI of the Gyanvapi mosque complex.

"PM Modi: War cannot solve problems, says PM Modi as Scholz sounds alarm on Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/war-cannot-solve-problems-says-pm-modi-as-scholz-sounds-alarm-on-russia/articleshow/114599108.cms,"PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz

The 7th India-Germany intergovernmental consultations (IGC) co-chaired by PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resulted in 8 major outcomes, including a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty that is expected to bolster joint efforts against terrorism and separatist elements.Scholz appreciated India’s support for just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and the readiness to use its ties with all parties to facilitate a political solution, as PM Modi maintained war cannot solve any problem and stressed India stood ready to make every possible contribution towards restoration of peace. With delivered and pledged assistance worth 28 billion euro, Germany is second only to the US in providing military aid to Ukraine.Speaking earlier at the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business, in the presence of PM Modi, the Chancellor warned if Russia succeeded with its “illegal brutal” war against Ukraine, there would be repercussions far beyond Europe's borders. Such an outcome, he added, would endanger global security and prosperity as a whole.Launched in 2011, IGC allows comprehensive review of ties as well as identification of new areas of cooperation at the cabinet level. Another important agreement signed was for exchange of classified information that, PM Modi said, reflected deep mutual trust between the 2 countries amid growing defence and security cooperation.Reaffirming commitment to green and sustainable development, both leaders launched an Indo-German Green Hydrogen Roadmap . Among geopolitical issues, the Russia-Ukraine war , West Asia conflict and Indo-Pacific situation were discussed in detail in the meeting.“The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of concern for both countries. India has always maintained that war cannot solve any problem at all and stands ready to make every possible contribution towards the restoration of peace,’’ said PM Modi, at a joint press event after the wide-ranging talks.In a joint statement, India and Germany also delivered a message to Russia that the threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable.In his opening remarks, PM Modi also raised the issue of tensions in the Indo-Pacific saying there are serious concerns about the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the region. “In such times, the strategic partnership between India and Germany has emerged as a strong anchor,’’ he said. Scholz will travel to Goa on Saturday where the German naval frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg and combat support ship Frankfurt am Main, as announced by the Indian government earlier, will make a port call as part of Germany’s Indo-Pacific deployment.The leaders underlined the need for reforms in multilateral institutions, particularly the UN Security Council , with PM Modi saying global forums created in the twentieth century are not capable of addressing challenges of the 21st century. Both India and Germany are members of the G4, along with Brazil and Japan, that seeks expansion of the Security Council and supports each other’s candidature for permanent membership. Scholz also backed an ambitious India-EU FTA, which remains under discussion, underscoring the “enormous potential” to further build and expand trade and investment between the 2 countries.In his remarks at the media event, Scholz said no one can close their eyes to the Russia-Ukraine war and its effects. “This war, which has been raging for so long now and is claiming so many victims, must finally come to an end. The integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be preserved,"" Scholz said, adding Russia’s aggression had put under strain the international rules-based order. Scholz also said it was significant that India was an anchor of stability in South Asia in these times.On other areas of cooperation PM Modi said that a whole-of-government approach to Critical and Emerging Technologies, Skill Development, and Innovation had also been agreed upon. “This will strengthen cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductors, and Clean Energy. It will also help in building secure, trusted, and resilient global supply value chains,’’ he said.Welcoming Germany’s Skilled Labour Strategy released for India, PM Modi said he was confident that India’s young talent pool will get better opportunities to contribute to Germany's development.",The 7th India-Germany intergovernmental consultations (IGC) co-chaired by PM Narendra Modi and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resulted in 8 major outcomes.

India becoming a global trade and manufacturing hub,” Modi said, adding that today, India stands on strong pillars of democracy, demography, demand and data.Germany is facing an acute shortage of skilled professionals and is looking at the talent pool in India to make up for the shortfall.India also raised the case of Ariha Shah, a three-year-old Indian girl who has been in foster care in Germany, during the meeting between Modi and Scholz. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said at a media briefing that the chancellor has assured the PM that he is “very closely following” the issue.The girl has been in foster care in Germany for more than 36 months following allegations of minor physical abuse. Her parents, Bhavesh and Dhara Shah, are residents of Mira Bhayander in Maharashtra’s Thane district.“The case has been followed very, very closely by us.... Our embassy in Berlin has taken it up. When the external affairs minister was in Germany a few weeks ago, he had raised it very strongly with his counterpart,” Misri said.“Yes, I can confirm that it was raised during Friday’s meeting as well. We have at all levels impressed upon the German side that an Indian child growing up in an environment that is not hers -- cultural, religious, linguistic environment -- is somewhat unnatural and that this situation needs to be addressed,” he added.The foreign secretary said Scholz assured Modi that “he is very closely following this issue and continues to pay close attention to it”, adding, “I am sure that both sides will remain in touch on this issue through various channels.”","Germany has decided to increase the number of visas for skilled Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 per year.

"Agent Vikash: Wanted by FBI, but patriot to his village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agent-vikash-wanted-by-fbi-but-patriot-to-his-village/articleshow/114599403.cms,"Vikash Yadav’s house in Pranpura is harder to reach than to find. It’s only after clearing a couple of verification rounds from locals that the large iron gate that hides most of the single-storey house with a pink fence — on the last line of settlements beyond which lies typically shrub-speckled Aravali terrain — parts. But there’s no going in unaccompanied.“Sensitive matter,” we are told by a group playing cards that is our first ‘check point’.“No cameras, please, and no recording on the mobile phone,” we are subsequently told by our local escort who agrees to show us the way.Sporadically seen and rarely heard from, Vikash is as inconspicuous as he could be in Pranpura, just one among hundreds of its youths who took up jobs and left and return only to visit family. This changed last week, sensationally.On Oct 17, Vikash shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder-for-hire charges against him for the attempted assassination of New York-based separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Vikash, according to the American indictment, was also aware of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , another separatist, last year in Canada, which has brought a chill in New Delhi-Ottawa ties after the Justin Trudeau govt alleged Indian govt agencies were involved.Though the US indictment refers to Vikash as an Indian govt official — employed by the cabinet secretariat that oversees R&AW — New Delhi has denied it, saying Vikash had been dismissed from service. In a recent statement, Union ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Vikash Yadav is no longer an employee of govt of India.”Pranpura and Vikash’s family believe neither.The watch has been necessitated by journalists landing up and making inquiries about Vikash since the US indictment revealed his name as a co-conspirator (CC1). Pranpura, part of a cluster of villages in Haryana’s Rewari district near the industrial town of Bawal, is 105 km to Delhi’s south, but not on any of the state or national highways that crisscross the region. In this place of familiar faces and routines, the American revelation creased many brows for two reasons — that Vikash was now wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the indictment’s implication that he was working as an Indian spy.“How do you know what the Americans are saying is true?” shot back Sudesh. In her 60s, Vikash’s mother spoke from behind the gate after our escort, Rajeev, called out to her. Sudesh, and anyone else you talk to in the village, insist Vikash has always been and remains a govt employee.“My son works for the country and our govt will take care of him,” said Sudesh, who knows little else about Vikash’s job except that he is a “CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) commandant”.It’s how the rest of Pranpura — which prides itself as a ‘fauji gaon’ (Army village) with a martyrs’ memorial next to the panchayat office its most prominent landmark — knows Vikash too. Like many of them, Rajeev, a neighbour of Sudesh, brushed off the Pannun plot revelation, calling Vikash “a patriot who serves the country”.Vikash, now 39, was born in a ‘fauji’ household in the mid-80s. His father Ram Singh Yadav was in the BSF and died of a heart attack in 2007 when he was posted in Tripura. The family moved around the North East with Yadav senior’s postings, so Vikash and Ajay did their schooling in different places, including Shillong . But both completed their graduation from Ahir College in Rewari.Ajay is now posted in Gurgaon as a police head constable. His wife and two children live with Sudesh. Vikash’s family — wife and one-year-old daughter — is in Delhi.“Our family has always served the country,” said Sudesh. “I don’t believe Vikash committed any crime.” Vikash, added Sudesh, does not visit home regularly and “calls once in a while”. “I don’t know where he and his family are right now. He hasn’t contacted us,” she said, declining comment on media reports that Vikash had spoken to his family after his name as CC-1 was revealed and rubbished the charges.Sudesh said she also had no idea about his arrest last year by Delhi Police. The arrest on Dec 18 by Delhi Police’s Special Cell, on charges of extortion and kidnapping of a businessman from Rohini, followed the first indictment in the Pannun plot probe by the department of justice last Nov. Vikash spent three months in custody before a Delhi court granted him six days of interim bail on March 22 to see his daughter who was undergoing treatment for acute respiratory infection.The court order described Vikash as an “ex-govt employee with clean antecedents”. On April 22, Vikash was granted regular bail with no objection from the prosecution.A Central Administrative Tribunal principal bench order dated Nov 29, 2023 shows Vikash was appointed senior field officer (SFO) of Aviation Research Centre (ARC) in the executive cadre of Directorate General of Security (cabinet secretariat) on Oct 9, 2023 after the completion of probation. ARC is part of R&AW. Vikash knocked on CAT’s door for permanent appointment after working as a probationer in the agency since Nov 2015.In May, soon after his release from prison, Vikash visited Pranpura, the last time Sudesh claims she saw him. “He came here alone and stayed for a couple of days. He didn’t tell me that he was arrested,” Sudesh said.Vikash, neighbour Rajeev offered, hardly left his home during visits, so interactions with him since he began working were rare. “He was good in academics and a fitness freak,” Rajeev said.A local resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no one in India would see Vikash as a criminal, even if the US indictment is true. “Pannun is a wanted accused in India and America does not want to hand him over to us. They also did not hand over (26/11 Mumbai terror attacks accused) David Headley, who is a terrorist. Assuming Vikash is an Indian officer, why should India hand him over for doing his job?” he said. Another villager said since the US indictment named Vikash, police had visited the sarpanch and made some inquiries. “No security has been posted here as they felt it is not required in our village. It is safe here,” said a neighbour of Sudesh.“We will wait and watch. What else can we do?” said a neighbour. “Sarkar dekh legi.”How do you know what the Americans are saying is true, asks Vikash’s mother Sudesh, speaking from behind the gate of their house at Pranpura in Rewari. She insists, along with others from the village, that he is a patriot and a govt employee, calling the US’s murder-for-hire allegations ‘false’.","Vikash Yadav shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder- for-hire charges against him. Vikash, according to the American indictment, was also aware of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year in Canada.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114599405,imgsize-24414,width-400,resizemode-4/114599405.jpg"

BJP hit back, saying Kejriwal had not been attacked and it was the anger of residents building up as elections near. Delhi Police said they had not received any complaint and no video of the alleged incident had surfaced yet.“Knowing they can’t defeat Arvind Kejriwal in elections, BJP resorts to dirty tactics by threatening his life,” chief minister Atishi said. “First, BJP tried to harm him by withholding insulin in jail by arresting him in a fake case, and now, by launching a deadly assault.” Kejriwal enjoys Z-security cover. Other AAP functionaries, including Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and Saurabh Bharadwaj echoed the charges. A senior AAP functionary alleged that several BJP workers raised slogans against Kejriwal, tried to penetrate his security cover, and attacked him.Rubbishing AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said residents of Vikaspuri had turned up at the padyatra to complain about the supply of dirty water in the area, which was being projected by AAP functionaries as an attack on him.“When people complained of dirty water, Kejriwal got offended. After living in a palatial bungalow, his habit of walking in the streets has gone, and when people ask questions, AAP leaders are trying to project it as an attack,” he said. “You have looted the people of Delhi in the name of electricity, water, and buses.”South Delhi MP from BJP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said frustrated by the city’s deteriorating condition and corruption of AAP MLAs and councillors, Delhi residents are now taking to the streets to protest against Kejriwal. “This week, we even saw the MLAs of Matiala and Sangam Vihar being beaten by the public. Kejriwal should think about why this is happening,” she said.Kejriwal has faced attacks during campaigning in the past — in 2019, he was slapped by a man during a roadshow in Moti Nagar.AAP functionaries are currently undertaking padyatras in different assembly segments in the city in the run-up to the February 2025 polls. Former deputy CM Sisodia said BJP wants to eliminate Kejriwal by any means possible. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, “BJP must answer why they hate Arvind Kejriwal so much that they’re willing to attack him.”Bharadwaj said it was a “cowardly” attempt by BJP. “It was done because Kejriwal is going among the masses and is getting their love and affection. We want to make it clear that if Kejriwal faces any danger to his life or any harm is done to him, only BJP will be responsible for it,” he alleged.","Aam Aadmi Party alleged that BJP “goons’ tried to attack AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal.

Gyanvapi case: Varanasi court dismisses plea for additional ASI survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gyanvapi-case-varanasi-court-dismisses-plea-for-additional-asi-survey/articleshow/114590940.cms,"NEW DELHI: Varanasi court on Friday rejected a request from the Hindu side for an additional Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) examination of the Gyanvapi premises.Following the decision, Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi , representing the Hindu side, announced plans to file an appeal in the high court .“The court has rejected our application for an additional survey of the protection of the whole Gyanvapi area by the ASI,” Rastogi said. “We will go to the high court against this decision... within the time limitation, within 30 days.”Rastogi explained that the application for an additional survey was based on a previous directive issued on April 8, 2021. That order, according to Rastogi, had specified a detailed survey by a five-member ASI team that would include an expert from a central university and a representative from a minority community. However, the Hindu side believes the prior ASI survey did not meet these standards.“We had requested the court to comply with its previous directive dated April 8, 2021, as the prior survey and the report submitted did not adhere to that order. On April 8, 2021, the court had clearly directed that the ASI form a five-member team, which would include a representative from a minority community and an expert from a central university in archaeology. However, the previous survey report was solely conducted by ASI, lacking this specified team composition.”Rastogi noted that the high court endorsed this directive and advised that if the previous survey was found non-compliant, the local court should order an additional one. ""The order dated April 8, 2021—endorsed by the high court —directed this court that if the ASI’s earlier report did not align with the April 8 requirements, then an additional survey should be ordered. Based on the information I have gathered so far, this court has not taken that directive into consideration,” he said.Another point of contention, Rastogi pointed out, was that the survey request included the wazukhana (ablution area) and a 100-metre radius around it, but this area has yet to be fully surveyed. According to Rastogi, the court had instructed only for its preservation but did not seal it, leading the ASI to exclude it from the survey.“The wazukhana has not been sealed; the district magistrate was only directed to protect it, which does not mean sealing it. The ASI had previously stated that the high court had ordered it sealed, but no such order exists, and hence, that part of the property has not been surveyed,” he said.Rastogi further explained that the lack of excavation under the main dome, believed to be situated directly over the Jyotirlinga of Lord Vishweshwar. The prior survey, conducted with ground-penetrating radar, detected rubble and stones down to 5.8 meters but did not provide further insights from deeper levels.“Our request was to excavate a 4x4 metre trench at a safe distance to allow ASI to access the area below the central dome and report back to the court. We will now examine the grounds on which the court dismissed our application and proceed to the High Court with our appeal.”The Hindu side intends to seek compliance with the initial 2021 directive in their high court appeal, hoping for a more comprehensive survey to meet the specifications outlined in the court’s previous orders.",Varanasi court on Friday rejected a request from the Hindu side for an additional Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) examination of the Gyanvapi premises.

AHMEDABAD: Despite the perilous journey and a series of deaths of illegal Indian immigrants trying to cross the border, the lure of a life in the US, especially among Gujaratis, remains strong.During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada. Of these, Indians constituted 90,415, US Customs and Border Protection (US-CBP) data shows.Of this total, roughly 50% were from Gujarat, sources in Indian agencies tracking illegal immigration said. It could also be said that 10 Indians were arrested every hour, the sources said. Also, 43,764 were arrested at the US border with Canada, in the north, making it the highest number of Indians caught at this border till now.The data reveals a slight decline from the previous year's total of 32 lakh people, and in the number of Indians caught on the Mexico route . In FY 2023, the number of illegal Indian immigrants caught was 96,917. In 2024, fewer Indians (25,616) were caught at the US-Mexico border; this number in US FY 2023 was 41,770.""People have stopped using the donkey route via Mexico due to two key reasons. One is that they would be kept in Dubai or Turkey for some time before being taken to Mexico. US agencies, over the past few years, have been keeping sharp vigil on illegal immigrants staying in those countries and have broken links in the human smuggling chain,"" a source in the immigration network said.A source said, ""Gujaratis, too, began choosing Canada over Mexico as they could easily hire a taxi and cross over to the US. Recently, US authorities have tightened vigil on this border. Such immigrants are usually sent to Canada as most of them carry a Canadian visitor visa. However, the immigrants try again after some time on the same route.""Sources also said that people caught at the border may be very few compared to those who actually manage to sneak into the US.","During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada.

"Two anticyclones, mangrove forest save Odisha from Cyclone Dana’s fury",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-anticyclones-mangrove-forest-save-odisha-from-cyclone-danas-fury/articleshow/114599537.cms,"TOI

Bhubaneswar: Two anticyclones strategically located on either side of the severe Cyclone Dana played a crucial role in weakening its intensity and mitigating its impact on Odisha by sandwiching the storm from either side, India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) scientists said on Friday.The presence of anticyclones, which are characterised by the movement of air towards land in high-pressure conditions, acted as a counterforce to the cyclonic system. By sandwiching Cyclone Dana from both sides, these anticyclones effectively throttled its strength, preventing it from causing bigger destruction.The complex interaction of two anticyclones apart, Odisha was shielded from the full fury of Cyclone Dana by the mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika National Park . The severe cyclone made landfall near a tourist camp in Bhitarkanika between 1.30 am and 3.30 am on Friday, with the 209 sq km of mangrove forest in Kendrapada bearing the brunt.“Had there been no anticyclones, rain before the landfall of the cyclone would have been widespread, affecting many central Odisha districts, while stronger winds would have been felt over a larger area,” IMD scientist Uma Shankar Das told. “The anticyclones constricted the cyclone. Only the northern Odisha districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj received heavy rainfall, he added.Weather experts said that due to the influence of an active anticyclone over the Arabian Sea, there was a significant impact of dry airflow from the north-northwest on the left side of the storm.Similarly, an active anticyclone zone was also present on the eastern side of the storm, reducing its area of influence from the right. Cyclone Dana lay centred between these two anticyclones and moved northward, spreading over a smaller area, they said.The anticyclones also ensured there was no change in the cyclone’s path, making it more predictable, which helped in taking preventive measures with more certainty.Bhitarkanika National Park divisional forest officer Sudarshan Yadav was astonished by the minimal damage observed near the landfall point, highlighting the crucial role of mangrove forests in mitigating the impact of cyclones.Odisha chief minister Mohan Majhi, who faced his first major natural disaster since assuming office in June, attributed the state's effective response to the crisis to teamwork and the blessings of Lord Jagannath. ""We managed to achieve our target of zero casualty,"" he said; his govt had evacuated close to six lakh people, with the CM personally monitoring the situation at the control room in the special relief commissioner’s office late into the night.Heavy rainfall and wind speeds of up to 110 kmph to 120 kmph were recorded when the cyclone crossed the coast, IMD Bhubaneswar director Manorama Mohanty said. The wind speed fell to 60 kmph to 80 kmph.“As it grew weaker and turned into a depression, heavy rain is continuing in several northern districts of Odisha. Rainfall activity will reduce by Saturday,” she said.The maximum storm surge height of one to two metres above the astronomical tide inundated low-lying areas of Kendrapara and Bhadrak districts of Odisha at landfall. Several trees were uprooted, and kuccha houses were damaged by heavy rain and strong winds.Chandbali, in Bhadrak district, recorded the highest rainfall — 158.6 mm — in the last 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Friday, while seven other places in Kendrapada, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj districts recorded more than 100 mm of rain in this period. IMD issued a red alert for heavy rainfall in Balasore, Bhadrak, and Mayurbhanj districts for the next 24 hours following the landfall of Dana.An 82-year-old woman, identified as Hemalata Nayak, a native of Bankual village in Kendrapada district, died of a suspected heart attack in a cyclone shelter in Rajnagar Block on Thursday night. “The death was not related to the cyclone,” block development officer Nishant Mishra said.","Odisha was shielded from the full fury of Cyclone Dana by the mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika National Park.

Worli Seat: Milind Deora to take on Aaditya Thackeray in high-voltage battle for Worli seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/milind-deora-to-take-on-aaditya-thackeray-in-high-voltage-battle-for-worli-seat/articleshow/114599406.cms,"Shiv Sena RS MP Milind Deora entering the fray against sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray of the Shiv Sena (UBT)

MUMBAI: The Worli assembly seat in Mumbai is set to witness a big electoral bout with former Congress LS MP and currently Shiv Sena RS MP Milind Deora entering the fray against sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray of the Shiv Sena (UBT).With Deora's entry and MNS's Sandeep Deshpande already having filed his nomination papers from the seat, the fight in fact will be a three-way one, just like in the neighbouring Mahim seat, where there is a Sena (Sada Sarvankar) vs Sena (UBT) (Mahesh Sawant) vs MNS (Amit Thackeray) fight.""CM Eknath Shinde believes that justice for Worli and Worlikars is long overdue. Together, we're paving the way forward and will share our vision soon. It's Worli now!"" Deora said in a post on X on Friday, indicating he has been picked for the seat.Though Worli hasn't appeared on Sena's declared list yet, a senior Sena functionary said Deora's name was final.Both BJP and Sena led by Eknath Shinde were keen on fighting the high-profile seat, but it has gone to Sena in the Mahayuti arrangement.Deora, son of late Congress politician Murli Deora, was Congress MP for two terms (from 2004 to 2014) from Mumbai South , the Lok Sabha seat under which the Worli assembly seat falls.Deora was earlier this year in the race for the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat too, but it was given to Sena MLA Yamini Jadhav who lost to Sena's (UBT) Arvind Sawant. Deora, a former Congress MP and Union minister, quit Congress early this year and joined Sena and got a Rajya Sabha nomination. Worli is part of the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat. Aaditya filed his nomination from Worli on Thursday.From BJP, Shaina NC had been campaigning in the constituency. However, Sena had said that this seat would be fought by their nominee. Sources said Shaina NC, who had indicated her willingness to contest on a Sena ticket, lost out on account of the BJP's internal conflict.Making his political debut in the 2019 assembly polls, Aaditya, who became the first member of the Thackeray family to contest an election, defeated his NCP rival Suresh Mane by a margin of over 70,000 votes.However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the Sena (UBT) candidate Arvind Sawant got a lead of only 6,715 votes from the Worli seat .While Sena had for long not been able to identify any candidate from this seat, both CM Eknath Shinde and his son MP Dr Shrikant Shinde had remained focused on it and visited it frequently. In Sept, heating up the political atmosphere in Worli, Shrikant Shinde visited Worli as part of his 'jansamvad yatra.'In 2022, soon after the MVA government was toppled, Aaditya wrote an emotional letter to residents of his constituency on completing three years as MLA. In his letter, Aaditya had also taken a dig at the BJP, without naming the party, saying that every party now wants to spend time and money in his constituency as Worli had made enviable progress. Aaditya said that they (rival parties) too wanted to come to Worli now. In his letter, Aaditya had hit out at the CM Eknath Shinde-led faction for ""indulging in dirty politics and betrayal.""","Worli assembly seat in Mumbai set to witness a big electoral bout.
