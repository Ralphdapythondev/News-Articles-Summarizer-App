Focus on green energy as Malaysian PM arrives in India today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focus-on-green-energy-as-malaysian-pm-arrives-in-india-today/articleshow/112615745.cms,"KUALA LAMPUR: Visiting Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim is expected to make an emphatic pitch for Indian investments to revive his country's economy and amplify its digital and green energy sectors given India's solid experience and skill. Anwar is scheduled to reach Delhi on Monday evening. This will be Malaysia's first prime-ministerial visit to India since 2018.He will meet PM Narendra Modi on August 20.Sources said the two sides are working towards a substantive agreement on the start-ups sector. Currently, Indian start-ups like RazorPay and Pine Labs have nearly 70 percent share of the digital payment market, B2B, in Malaysia. Local start-ups, on the other hand, are tapping into India's digital technology sector.Talking to TOI in Kuala Lumpur, industry leaders and policymakers said two important takeaways for Malaysia on bilateral trade would be - getting India's expertise from its National Skill Development programme, and collaboration and support on Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Artificial Intelligence.India has a robust longterm growth trajectory, aided by new EV policy measures that are wooing investors. But with Tesla recently scrapping its plan to manufacture EVs in Malaysia, government here finds itself in a difficult spot. It has, from time to time, announced its readiness to shift gears in the car market and build an EV ecosystem with battery development. Barring a few wealthy buyers, EVs still face low demand. Experts in the sector believe Anwar will seek investment from India to grow this promising but nascent industry in Malaysia.Other key sectors will include import of palm oil from Malaysia that suffered due to former PM Mahathir Mohamad's trenchant posturing on Kashmir. Anwar will seek to iron this out with PM Modi.India imported Malaysian palm oil to the value of 7.08 billion Malaysian Ringgit between January to August 2023.

Graft case relief for man as CBI errs on gift to son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/graft-case-relief-for-man-as-cbi-errs-on-gift-to-son/articleshow/112614307.cms,"CHENNAI: A simple, sentimental gift to a 10-year-old boy led to the collapse of a high-value corruption case against a railway engineer . The CBI misclassified this family hand-me-down property as a financial asset, inflating charges and leading to the eventual acquittal of his parents.Judge S Ezhil Velavan found critical mistakes in the investigation against KSSVP Murthy Raju and his wife K Pushpavalli, ruling the property was wrongly included and that the CBI failed to prove the couple's assets exceeded their income.The court then acquitted the couple of all charges.The case against Raju, a deputy chief engineer in the railways, and Pushpavalli spanned over a decade. The CBI accused them of possessing disproportionate assets totalling Rs 54.6 lakh.The CBI's investigation scrutinised every aspect of the couple's finances, including salary slips, property deeds, bank accounts, and personal gifts.Central to this investigation was a Rs 92,900 property gift given to their son Sushanth, when he was 10 years old, by a relative, G Nalini Mohan Raju.This property was not a typical financial acquisition, but a sentimental family hand-me-down intended to secure the boy's future. However, the CBI mistakenly treated this gift as a significant financial transaction , adding it to the list of assets the couple allegedly could not explain.This mistake inflated the family's perceived wealth, contributing to the corruption charges against them. The inclusion of this property as a disproportionate asset tipped the scales in the CBI's investigation, making the case appear stronger than it was.Further, the CBI erred by overvaluing assets like a Rs 1-lakh gold necklace and miscalculating cash and investments, such as Rs 6.4 lakh in a finance firm and Rs 2.2 lakh in a locker. They also failed to properly review documentation, wrongfully including Rs 35,500 in gold jewellery and legitimate investments as disproportionate assets.The defence exposed these errors, proving the property gifted to Sushanth was a non-financial transfer wrongly included as a disproportionate asset.","KSSVP Murthy Raju and his wife K Pushpavalli were accused of possessing disproportionate assets totalling Rs 54.6 lakh.

What does the

postmortem report

say?

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

CBI team arrives in Kolkata to begin investigation

CBI takes cue from parents’ charges, grills RG Kar ex-principal for 24 hrs

KOLKATA: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after the police force had formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case.Read also: Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Case Live: IMA’s nationwide strike begins, here's what's open and closed; RG Kar Hospital vandalism victims recall night of horror On Sunday, investigators discovered the most compelling evidence against Sanjay Roy, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor.Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Roy's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack, said a senior cop.According to a senior police officer, the victim, despite being half-asleep, had put up a desperate fight against her attacker, and it was this struggle that provided investigators with the crucial evidence they needed to link Roy to the crime.“Rumours don’t help but harm probe,” the Kolkata Police wrote on their social media page after handing over all probe details to the CBI. They stated that they had done their best over the past four days and would continue to assist the CBI moving forward.The police also emphasised that certain ""misinformation"" being spread is either ""scientifically"" or ""legally"" impossible.The murder has triggered widespread outrage with doctors and nurses protesting in Kolkata and other parts of India. Outpatient services and routine surgeries were severely disrupted in government hospitals nationwide on Monday as resident doctors protested the rape and murder of a colleague at Kolkata's R G Kar Medical College and Hospital. The demonstrations were most prominent in Delhi and Kolkata, which became the focal points of the protest.The protesting doctors are calling for a CBI investigation into the incident and the urgent implementation of a central law to safeguard healthcare workers from violence.Sandip Ghosh , the principal of RG Kar Medical College , has resigned from his post in the wake of the incident. Within four hours, he was appointed as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College (CNMC).West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has warned the Kolkata police that the investigation will be transferred to the CBI if they are unable to solve the case by Sunday.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team has arrived in Kolkata to take over the investigation into the rape and murder of a female trainee doctor at a state-run medical college, as ordered by the Calcutta high court.Hours after the CBI filed an FIR in the RG Kar rape-murder case in New Delhi, the agency took custody of primary suspect, Sanjay Roy. They took him for a medical examination and began interrogating him at its CGO Complex office.Senior officials from New Delhi reached Kolkata Tuesday night and formed three teams. One team took custody of the accused, another visited RG Kar with forensic experts from CFSL Delhi, and the third team reviewed call records and other data from the victim’s mobile phone.Sources revealed that the CBI is investigating the victim’s activities in the hours leading up to her death, focusing on the people she interacted with or communicated. Kolkata Police has already provided related documents, case diary, CCTV footage from the hospital and items from the seizure list, including a Bluetooth earphone wire found at the crime scene.Initially, the accused was taken to Command Hospital, but they informed the team that they could not conduct the examination there. He was then transferred to BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah, where the medical process was completed. The CBI team, along with members of the Central Forensic Laboratory, arrived at RG Kar Hospital around 3.40 pm and proceeded directly to the seminar hall where the young doctor’s body was found on Friday.On Thursday, CBI officials visited the home of the doctor who was allegedly raped and murdered at a hospital in Kolkata. As part of their ongoing investigation, they spoke with her parents and gathered information about the timing of the call they received from the hospital, notifying them of their daughter's untimely death.The officers also inquired about the victim's friends and whether she had mentioned any issues or concerns at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital , where she was a postgraduate trainee doctor.In addition to speaking with the victim's parents, the CBI interrogated five doctors from the hospital, as well as the former medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal (MSVP), principal, and the head of the Chest Department where the victim's body was discovered. They also spoke with the officer-in-charge of the Tala police station, which has jurisdiction over the hospital.As part of their investigation, the CBI has requested detailed information about Civic Volunteer Sanjay Roy, who was arrested after the victim's body was found on Friday. This includes his call detail record and mobile tower location, among other relevant data.CBI officers on Friday questioned former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh at their office late into the night. The development came a while after Calcutta High Court posted Ghosh’s plea, seeking protection for him and his family, for hearing on Monday.Ghosh had resigned as principal on Monday, only to be put in charge of another state-run medical college and hospital around four hours later. A day later, the high court, expressing shock, had commented on Ghosh’s “power”, and ordered him to go on a long leave.On Friday, he was stopped by CBI officers near City Centre, Salt Lake, asked to get out of his car, and taken to the CBI office at the CGO Complex. At the time of going to press, more than 10 hours after he was taken in, he was still being questioned.RG Kar Medical College and Hospital former principal Sandip Ghosh’s questioning by CBI, which started Friday (August 16) afternoon, continued till 11.30pm on Saturday, with only a short break in the early hours, when he was allowed to go home. The marathon 24-hour interrogation over two days is the longest by the central agency in any case in Bengal in the recent past.The questioning began a day after a team of CBI officials, led by joint director V Chandrasekhar, spoke to the parents of the deceased 31-year-old postgraduate trainee doctor at their Sodepur residence. The parents have alleged that their daughter “was under mental pressure and was reluctant to go to work” and the hospital had tried to pass off the rape-murder as suicide.Ghosh was allowed to go home for a short break at 2.30am Saturday after 11 hours of grilling. However, at 10.30am, he was back at the central agency’s CGO complex office with several files.According to sources, the agency’s special crime unit bombarded Ghosh with a barrage of questions, including when he learnt of the PGT doctor’s death, who informed him and what steps he took on receiving the news. The former principal claimed he was in no way linked to the doctor’s death.","Civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the rape and murder of a second-year post-graduate doctor at Kar Hospital in Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform. He would be happy with being the number one-ranked batter in ODIs. Who gives these rankings? On what basis are Babar Azam and Shubman Gill there?"" Basit said.Basit pointed out that the batters, who were standout performers in the World Cup, are conspicuously absent from the top ranks.Basit emphasized that during the 2023 World Cup, players like Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand, Quinton de Kock of South Africa, and Australia’s Travis Head made significant contributions, each scoring multiple centuries.Even Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman managed to notch up a century each.""Babar's last ODI was at the last year's World Cup. We saw the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Quinton de Kock, Travis Head and Virat Kohli at the World Cup. They scored three-four hundreds in the tournament. For Pakistan, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman scored a century each.

Forced to look for alternative path after so much insult and contempt ... have 3 options: Ex-Jharkhand CM Champai Soren amid BJP switch buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forced-to-look-for-alternative-path-after-so-much-insult-and-contempt-have-3-options-ex-jharkhand-cm-champai-soren/articleshow/112608470.cms,"'Tried to control my tears'



Full text of Champai Soren's post on X:



NEW DELHI: In a strong indication that former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren may quit the party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader penned an emotional letter on X detailing the ""insults and contempt "" he has had to bear recently at the hands of his own partymen that eventually forced him to look for an "" alternative path "".Commenting on the recent media reports over a rift within the JMM and that Champai Soren may leave the party and join the BJP, the senior leader said: ""After so much insult and contempt, I was forced to look for an alternative path.With a heavy heart, I said in a meeting of the legislative party that - 'A new chapter of my life is going to start from today'. I had three options in this. First, to retire from politics, second, to form my own separate organisation and third, if I find a companion on this path, then to travel further with him. From that day till today, and till the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections, all options are open for me in this journey.""In another post, Champai reiterated that he had no intention of harming JMM: ""One more thing, this is my personal struggle, so I have no intention of involving any party member in it or causing any harm to the organisation. We can never even think of harming the party which we have nurtured with our blood and sweat.""Recalling how an ""unprecedented turn of events"" led him to being picked as the 12th Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Champai said: ""From the first day of my tenure to the last day (July 3), I discharged my duties towards the state with full devotion and dedication.""He also went into detail about how he was quickly shunted out of official duties once Hemant Soren got bail in a land scam case. Just days after walking out of jail on June 28, Hemant Soren took oath as the Jharkhand CM on July 4.""The day after Hul Diwas [June 30], I came to know that all my programs for the next two days have been postponed by the party leadership. One of these was a public program in Dumka, while the other was to distribute appointment letters to PGT teachers. On asking, I came to know that a meeting of the legislative party has been called by the coalition on July 3, till then you cannot attend any program as CM. Can there be anything more humiliating in a democracy than a Chief Minister's programs being cancelled by another person? Despite swallowing this bitter pill of insult, I said that the appointment letters would be distributed in the morning, while the legislative party meeting would be held in the afternoon, so I would attend it from there. But, I was flatly refused from there. For the first time in my spotless political journey of the last four decades, I was broken from within. I could not understand what to do. For two days, I sat quietly and introspected, kept searching for my mistake in the whole incident. I did not have the greed for power even a bit, but to whom could I show this blow to my self-respect? Where could I express the pain inflicted by my own people? When the party's central executive meeting has not been held for years, and one-sided orders are passed, then whom should I go to and tell my problems?""""Although the Chief Minister has the right to call a meeting of the legislative party, I was not even told the agenda of the meeting. During the meeting, I was asked to resign. I was surprised, but I had no greed for power, so I immediately resigned, but my heart was emotional due to the blow to my self-respect. I was so emotional due to the insulting behaviour I was facing for the last three days that I was trying to control my tears, but they were only interested in the chair ... many such insulting incidents happened, which I do not want to mention right now. After so much insult and contempt, I was forced to look for an alternative path.""Johar friends,After watching the news today, many questions must be arising in your mind. What happened that brought the son of a poor farmer living in a small village of Kolhan to this point. From raising the voice of workers against industrial houses at the beginning of my public life to the Jharkhand movement, I have always done politics of public concern. I have been trying to get the rights of the tribals, natives, poor, laborers, students and people of backward classes of the state. Whether I held any post or not, I was always available to the public, raising the issues of those people who had dreamt of a better future with the state of Jharkhand.Meanwhile, on January 31, after an unprecedented turn of events, the India Alliance chose me to serve the state as the 12th Chief Minister of Jharkhand. From the first day of my tenure to the last day (July 3), I discharged my duties towards the state with full devotion and dedication.During this period, we took many decisions in public interest and, as always, was always available for everyone. The people of the state will evaluate the decisions we took keeping in mind the elders, women, youth, students and every section of the society and every person of the state. When I got power, I paid homage to heroes like Baba Tilka Manjhi, Bhagwan Birsa Munda and Sido-Kanhu and pledged to serve the state.Every child in Jharkhand knows that during my tenure, I never did anything wrong to anyone, nor did I let anything wrong happen to anyone. Meanwhile, the day after Hul Diwas, I came to know that all my programs for the next two days have been postponed by the party leadership. One of these was a public program in Dumka, while the other was to distribute appointment letters to PGT teachers.On asking, I came to know that a meeting of the legislative party has been called by the coalition on July 3, till then you cannot attend any program as CM.

When the party's central executive meeting has not been held for years, and one-sided orders are passed, then whom should I go to and tell my problems? I am counted among the senior members in this party, the rest are juniors, and the supremo who is senior to me is no longer active in politics due to health, then what option did I have? If he had been active, perhaps the situation would have been different.Although the Chief Minister has the right to call a meeting of the legislative party, I was not even told the agenda of the meeting. During the meeting, I was asked to resign. I was surprised, but I had no greed for power, so I immediately resigned, but my heart was emotional due to the blow to my self-respect.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the August 9 rape-murder of a doctor at Kolkata's R G Kar hospital. This comes days after Calcutta HC had transferred to probe to CBI expressing reservations about Kolkata police's probe into the case.CJI D Y Chandrachud ordered registration of suo motu criminal writ petition. A bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra will initiate proceedings at 10.30 am on Tuesday.It is rare for SC to take suo motu cognisance of an issue that has already been taken serious note of by a jurisdictional high court.The very fact that the apex court has taken note of the incident indicates its intention to examine long-neglected systemic loopholes resulting in such incidents.While high court may still be permitted to carry on with the monitoring of the ongoing CBI investigations, SC is expected to take a pan-India call on the lack of safety of doctors and healthcare professionals, especially women, in hospitals. The bench headed by CJI is likely to seek responses from West Bengal and Union governments about addressing this issue.It may also decide to implead all states and Union Territories as parties to the case if it were to lay down a pan-India safety guideline.Another factor which may have forced SC to take up the case was the Aug 14 midnight vandalism at the Kolkata hospital that was allegedly aimed at foiling a planned rally by doctors and students in solidarity with simultaneous “reclaim the night” marches across the city. The mob targeted patients, staff, medical equipment and hospital property. Nurses, security guards, and even visitors were traumatised by threats given by the mob. Subsequently, high court rapped state government for its inability to provide security to medical and healthcare professionals and staff at the hospital.Interestingly, an SC bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Karol and Sanjay Kumar had dismissed a writ petition filed by Delhi Medical Association and Dr Satyajit Borah last month seeking adequate security for medical and healthcare professionals citing numerous incidents of violent attacks on doctors by irate relatives of patients.Justice Khanna-led bench told senior advocate Vijay Hansaria that the SC cannot direct the government to bring in a legislation in this regard. Observing that anybody who indulges in violence can be dealt with under the penal code, the bench had said that the only question is the implementation of the law.",CJI D Y Chandrachud ordered registration of suo motu criminal writ petition.

Severe heatwave in Terai region impacts dragon fruit production,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/severe-heatwave-in-terai-region-impacts-dragon-fruit-production/articleshow/112611513.cms,"RUDRAPUR: The unusually high temperatures in the Terai region this year have severely affected dragon fruit cultivation , resulting in substantial losses to farmers. The intense heatwave, exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon, caused temperatures to soar to 44°C in May and June, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit weight, according to officials of the horticulture department , Udham Singh Nagar .Dragon fruit, a perennial cactus known for its medicinal properties, requires a warm climate with an annual rainfall of at least 50 cm, and temperatures ranging from 20-36°C for optimal growth. However, farmers said that excessive heat this year resulted in a significant decrease in fruit size, with most dragon fruits weighing between just 6-150 grams, much lower than the expected 250-600 grams. Consequently, they have been unable to generate profits from their crops.Yatin Singhal, a farmer from Kashipur who has been cultivating dragon fruit for the past four years and encountered similar challenges with his crop, said, “This season, about 80% of the fruits weighed only 6-150 grams. Only 20% managed to reach 200-250 grams.”Prabhakar Singh, chief horticulture officer of Udham Singh Nagar, said, “The extreme heat during El Nino affected the production of dragon fruit, leading to insufficient growth and reduced weight. Despite setbacks, there is hope for improved production post-monsoon and more favourable growing conditions.”","The intense heatwave, exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon, caused temperatures to soar to 44°C in May and June.
