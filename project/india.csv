New NPS Budget 2024 Benefits Explained: In the Budget 2024, the government has announced significant changes to the National Pension System (NPS) contributions, allowing for greater tax savings. The contribution limit for employers in the private sector has been raised from 10% to 14% of the employee's basic salary. This new limit applies to both private and public sector employees, exclusively under the new tax regime.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, emphasises that this increase will enable employees opting for the new tax regime to save more taxes and build a larger pension pool for social security.According to an ET report, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighted in her Budget 2024 speech that the deduction for employers' contributions towards NPS will be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary. This deduction applies to employees in the private sector, public sector banks, and undertakings who opt for the new tax regime.The tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year. Under the current income tax laws, the old tax regime allows for three deductions under the Income-tax Act, 1961, while the new tax regime allows only one deduction.Under the old tax regime, an individual can claim up to Rs 9.5 lakh in deductions through three routes:Under the new tax regime, an individual can claim a deduction of up to Rs 7.5 lakh under Section 80CCD (2).Upon withdrawal, an individual must use at least 40% of the NPS corpus to purchase an annuity plan from an insurance company. The remaining 60% can be withdrawn as a lump sum.On October 27, 2023, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) announced that NPS subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of their pension corpus via a systematic lump sum withdrawal (SLW) method. Subscribers can withdraw the lump sum in a phased manner (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually) up to the age of 75 years.However, there is still a lack of clarity among tax experts regarding the tax-free status of money withdrawn via the SLW method.On January 12, 2024, the PFRDA issued a master circular on partial withdrawals from the NPS Tier-I account. Partial withdrawals are allowed for specific reasons such as:Other conditions for partial withdrawal include:","Tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year.

Budget 2024: How TCS is set to become less TDS for salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-how-tcs-is-set-to-become-less-tds-for-salaried-class/articleshow/111970089.cms,"Top Picks For You Budget 2024: Out with old, new makes news

Individuals miffed at tax collection at source ( TCS ) proposals have now been offered a small relief - provided they have salary income .At present, a salaried employee may declare income, such as bank interest and rent, to their employer, who factors this and, accordingly, deducts a higher tax against the monthly salary. The employee then does not have to worry about paying advance tax as adequate tax has already been withheld.A similar norm comes into effect from Oct 1.The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income. Thus, it will avoid cash-flow issues. Further, if a refund was due, owing to TCS, the individual taxpayer will no longer have to wait for it as it is adjusted against TDS on salary income.TCS applies to a wide range of remittances made under Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of Reserve Bank of India. It permits an individual to remit up to $2.5 lakh per year, without seeking prior approval.Thus far, purchase of an overseas tour package pinched the pocket - it meant a 5% TCS for a remittance of up to Rs 7 lakh; if the expenditure was higher, TCS was 20%. Or for that matter, sending a child overseas meant that TCS at 5% was deducted for any remittance above Rs 7 lakh (the rate was lower for remittances via education loans).In short, the Budget has added a sweetener to TCS provisions for salaried individuals.","The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income.

NEW DELHI: With a looming international debt crisis fueled by instable political situation and Gulf crisis at the time, India had foreign exchange reserves that could ""suffice to finance imports for a mere fortnight.""

"India tests ballistic missile defence system to intercept 5,000-km class enemy missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-ballistic-missile-defence-system-to-intercept-5000-km-class-enemy-missiles/articleshow/111996217.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of its two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system, with the defence ministry promptly proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.In the test, the “target missile” mimicking an enemy’s long-range ballistic missile was first launched from the Dhamra missile launch complex in Odisha at 4.20 pm.Swiftly “detected” by radars deployed on land and sea, the BMD system then kicked into action to launch the “AD (advanced area defence) endo-atmospheric interceptor missile” from the integrated test at Chandipur at 4.24 pm.“The interceptor destroyed the target. The flight-test fully met all the trial objectives, validating the complete network-centric warfare weapon system consisting of long-range sensors, low latency communication system and advanced interceptor missiles,” a DRDO official said.The solid-fuelled, two-stage interceptor missile system is meant for “neutralising many types of enemy ballistic missile threats in the altitude bracket of endo to low exo-atmospheric regions”, he added. Congratulating the DRDO for the successful flight test, defence minister Rajnath Singh said it has again demonstrated the country’s BMD capability.India, unlike countries like the US, Russia, China and Israel, however still has a long way to go before it can operationally deploy an effective BMD system, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.The DRDO has successfully completed a series of tests for the Phase-1 of the BMD system, which is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”, as was earlier reported by TOI.Even as the Phase-I of the BMD system, with the interceptor missiles flying at Mach 4.5 supersonic speeds, is yet to be deployed, DRDO had tested a new long-range flexible interceptor missile called AD-1under the Phase-II in November 2022.Then, DRDO also conducted the maiden flight trial of a sea-based endo-atmospheric interceptor missile from a warship in April last year. Apart from a land-based BMD system, a mobile sea-based version is also required to build an operationally effective missile shield. “Sea-based version gives you distributive capability,” an officer said.The US, incidentally, has around 50 ship-borne Aegis BMD systems that provide layered air and missile defence against all sorts of missiles, from short-range ones to ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles).India till now has refrained from sanctioning the full-scale operational deployment of the Phase-1 of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the high costs involved, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.India’s BMD programme has been in the works since the late-1990s, with its first interceptor missile being tested in November 2006. Having conducted over a dozen tests of the BMD system since then, a few of which have failed, DRDO in the past has said that it has a “kill probability of 99.8%” with the mix of exo and endo-interceptor missiles.The IAF, of course, has inducted the Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems that can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km.",India on Wednesday successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of its two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system.

MUMBAI: In his police statement, actor Salman Khan (58) has alleged that he believes gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his gang members were behind the firing incident outside his Bandra residence on April 14. Khan said he believes the attack was carried out with the intention of killing him and his family members.Observing that there is ample prima facie evidence on record to proceed against the accused, a special MCOCA court on Monday took cognisance of the chargesheet filed in the case earlier this month.On April 14, a biker and a pillion rider discharged several rounds at the balcony of Khan's Bandra home and absconded.In his statement made in June, which is part of the chargesheet, the actor said, ""There had been attempts to hurt me and my family prior to this as well. I have learned from social media that Bishnoi and gang have taken responsibility for the attack. So, I believe that it is the Bishnoi gang who have carried out the firing at my balcony."" As a result, Khan always advises his family members and those around him to stay alert. Khan has been provided with Y-Plus security from Mumbai police. He has weapon-trained policemen, bodyguards and private security for protection too.Recalling the events of April 14, Khan said he heard a cracker-like sound while asleep. Later, at 4.55am, his police bodyguard informed him that two people on a bike had fired at the first-floor balcony of his home in Galaxy Apartment.The chargesheet also includes transcripts of a conversation over Signal app between wanted accused Anmol Bishnoi and shooter Vikas Gupta.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken the lead in preparations for upcoming byelections to 10 assembly seats, expected to be held later this year. He has formed a team of ministers to look after preparations even before the BJP organisation has started its own groundwork.This proactive approach has surprised many but analysts believe the outcome of the bypolls , after the party's lacklustre showing in the Lok Sabha elections, will have a direct impact on Yogi's image, and hence he is leading from the front.At the first meeting of 16 ministers, he tasked them with winning all 10 seats.Although the appointments have been made in consultation with the UP BJP leadership, including its chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and general secretary (organisation) Dharampal Singh, insiders emphasise that Yogi's decision to form the team should be seen as a proactive approach to improve BJP's tally. A couple of days after Yogi put the ministers in charge, BJP held a meeting and appointed its own in-charges. Analysts believe the bypolls will be a litmus test for Yogi's governance and UP BJP's organisational strength. It will also provide an opportunity to quell rumours of differences between the govt and organisation in UP before central leadership takes action in view of the LS poll debacle.Yogi's proactiveness is evident as he has not only appointed the ministers in charge but has also taken stock of the situation in these seats after receiving feedback from ministers. BJP is not in a comfortable position in the 10 seats where bypolls are to be held if one goes by its performance in the 2022 assembly polls. Of the 10 seats, Samajwadi Party had 5, BJP had 3, and its alliance partners NISHAD Party and RLD had one each.",Yogi Adityanath has taken the lead in preparations for upcoming byelections to 10 assembly seats.

'Judicial impropriety': 2 Supreme Court benches hearing same tree felling issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judicial-impropriety-2-supreme-court-benches-hearing-same-tree-felling-issue/articleshow/111997199.cms,"NEW DELHI: A case of illegal felling of hundreds of trees in south Delhi’s Ridge area , in which the CM and LG had been pulled up for their allegedly unlawful acts, took a sudden twist on Wednesday. A Supreme Court bench, which had passed a slew of stinging orders over the issue, faced charges of “judicial impropriety” for taking up the case while it was already pending before another bench.The two SC benches —one headed by Justice B R Gavai and the other by Justice Abhay S Oka — have been dealing with a case pertaining to widening of a road in the Ridge.On Wednesday, Gavai, after discovering that the matter had also been heard by Oka, said his bench had first initiated contempt proceedings against DDA in the case and Oka should’ve sought clarification from CJI before going ahead with the hearing. “The other bench has not adhered to judicial propriety,” Gavai said, put the proceedings before his bench on hold and referred the matter to “master of roster” CJI.Perhaps the case landed up before the two benches because of the overlap of their briefs — the bench headed by Justice Gavai deals in forest matters, while the one headed by Justice Oka adjudicates issues pertaining to environment, including the pollution crisis in NCR and protection of green cover around Taj Mahal and Taj Trapezium Zone. Going by the domain, permission for cutting of trees has to be sought from the Justice Oka-led bench.The bench headed by Justice Gavai had passed an order restraining DDA from allotting land in the Ridge area to anyone without the court's permission and issued a contempt notice to the DDA vice-chairman in April when it was brought to its notice that certain parcels had been given for widening of a road in violation of its order.In the meantime, another petition was filed in the SC highlighting that hundreds of trees were cut in violation of the law for widening of roads, and was listed before a bench headed by Justice Oka, which too issued a contempt notice to the DDA vice-chairman on illegal cutting of trees. Hearing in the case has reached an advanced stage in the last one month and the court, after examining the records, found that there was violation of law on behalf of all authorities concerned.As the case came up for hearing on Wednesday before Justices Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan, they noted that another bench was also hearing the matter and said it was not proper that parallel proceedings be conducted in the case.Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the petitioner who had brought to the court's notice the felling of trees, said it was not a case of impropriety by the Justice Oka bench as separate applications were filed. Opposing the submission made by senior advocate Vikas Singh on behalf of DDA seeking the court's permission for widening of roads, he said DDA had assured the other bench that it would withdraw the notification and it could not be allowed to do a U-turn. He further said it did not make any difference to him which bench heard the case but he was concerned about the court’s order.Advocate K Parameshwar, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that the contempt proceedings initiated by the Justice Oka-led bench have ""substantially travelled"".The court, after a brief hearing, passed an order referring the case to the CJI. ""In order to avoid conflicting orders, it is appropriate that matters of Ridge area be heard by the same bench. We direct the registrar judicial to place it before the CJI to obtain necessary instructions and clarifications,"" it said.On the last hearing in the case before a bench of Justices Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan, the court found fault with all authorities — DDA, Delhi govt, CM, LG — for allowing felling of trees and had said they should have accepted their mistake on day one instead of trying to “cover up”.It had said Delhi govt had permitted felling of trees when it did not have the power to do so and there was complete non-application of mind by LG V K Saxena in approving the Delhi govt’s proposal.",A Supreme Court bench faced charges of “judicial impropriety’ for taking up the case while it was already pending before another bench.

The opposition offensive against the Budget seeks to paint the governing party as beholden to its demanding allies TDP and JDU from Andhra and Bihar at the cost of others.

Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time. The choice of Haryana veteran Kumari Selja as the lead speaker and then Praniti Shinde of Maharashtra was to showcase the election states.

The court directed them to come back in a week with recommended names.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Haryana, submitted that over 500-600 large vehicles, which have been modified as ""armoured tanks"", are stationed at the site and if they are allowed to move into Delhi, the capital's law and order situations may be severely jeopardised.""You have to take some steps to reach out to farmers.

Supreme Court stays Madras HC order for valuation of LVB equity shares,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-madras-hc-order-for-valuation-of-lvb-equity-shares/articleshow/111997241.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed a Madras high court order directing Reserve Bank of India to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of shares and bonds of the distressed Laxmi Vilas Bank ( LVB ), prior to its amalgamation with Singapore's DBS Bank India in 2020. RBI and DBS Bank had questioned the legality of the HC's April 26 order.Appearing for RBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that to revive LVB, RBI had persuaded Singapore's DBS Bank to take it over to protect small depositors' interest.He said the HC decision off-tracks the entire scheme which was based on an agreement between RBI and DBS for taking over of LVB. For DBS, senior advocate Shyam Divan said writing off the equities and bonds was part of DBS's pre-condition to take over LVB and any variation would adversely impact the amalgamation that took place in Nov 2020.Countering their contention, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Arvind Datar said that the scheme for amalgamation can go on, but surely 92,000 ordinary equity holders could not be told one fine day that the value of their shares in LVB was zero even without a valuation being carried out. Both said they do not advocate the case of LVB bond holders.When the bench during the hearing mulled allowing valuation of equities, the SG said it would lead to unscrambling of the egg as the scheme was based on certain pre-conditions put by DBS. Divan said when the bank had negative value in 2020, the equities could not be said to carry any value and that was the reason the DBS had put a pre-condition that the equities and bonds are required to be written off.Brushing aside protests of Singhvi and Datar, the SC stayed the evaluation of equities and said, ""Valuation of shares four years down the line completely vitiates the scheme of amalgamation. The HC order is at complete variance of the scheme. If the HC order is upheld, then investors' confidence in the regulatory mechanism would be shaken affecting investments.""""We are in a completely different economy... Courts must be very very careful in interfering with such matters,"" the bench said, but agreed to adjudicate the issue raised by equity holdersThe HC had noted that a review of RBI's decision should consider the grievances of shareholders and bondholders and seek to mitigate any hardships caused by the compulsory amalgamation. Cases relating to this issue were transferred to Madras HC from various HCs by SC in 2022.",Supreme Court stayed a Madras high court order directing Reserve Bank of India to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of shares and bonds of the distressed Laxmi Vilas Bank.

Another test of nerves for students: CUET exam held in May but results not out yet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-test-of-nerves-for-students-cuet-exam-held-in-may-but-results-not-out-yet/articleshow/111997234.cms,"TOI

Another NTA-administered exam . Another lot of students who don’t know what’s happening. Even as NEET grabs headlines for all the wrong reasons, CUET — NTA’s test for college/university admissions — seems headed for bad news as well.A Mumbai-based private university, Somaiya Vidyavihar, that signed up for taking students basis their undergraduate CUET scores is holding induction programmes for freshmen.The university’s seats are all filled, and admissions have closed.Just one problem —CUET UG exams happened in May, results aren’t out yet. For universities and students, this is déjà vu. Last year, too, CUET results were delayed. Some universities pulled out of CUET as a result.This time, 1.4 million students took UG CUET, and, again, they don’t know what’s happening. Naturally, there are multiple anxieties.Anxiety No. 1: Most private universities accept CUET scores and hold their own entrance exams. Should everyone wait for CUET results and postpone the academic calendar? This will have knock on effects. Not just delayed start, but extra classes to finish the first part of the curriculum, shortening university holidays.Anxiety No. 2: Students are worried how long universities will wait for CUET scores. So, those who can, are arranging fallbacks. Ekta Jain, who wants to study psychology and is waiting for her CUET score, has secured a spot in another college as back-up.Anxiety No. 3: Will students lose money? UGC had said tuition paid by students should be refunded by September if admission is cancelled. But many students stand to lose what they paid as hostel fee. There’s also the additional spend from securing a backup admission. Nyasa Gautam, from Indore, says the backup admission has been an extra cost, which has added to the stress.Universities have started accepting students basis their own admission exams or other test scores, without waiting for CUET. Neelakanttan T A, from Thiruvananthapuram, says his preferred option was a central university, not a private one. But since Azim Premji university admissions are open, he’s decided to enrol there.Some institutions are resigned to the fact that the academic calendar will be messed up. All universities in Hyderabad are waiting for CUET results. “We are hoping that the results will be declared in a day or two so that we won’t lose much,” said Ishtiaque Ahmed, registrar, Maulana Azad National Urdu University.Visva Bharati’s acting public relations officer Atig Ghosh said extra classes or curtailing vacations will have to be considered. Other universities that have not started admissions expressed similar sentiments.Kanhaiya Ahuja, CUET admissions coordinator at Indore’s DAVV, said, “The delay leaves us with only three and a half months to complete the syllabus for the first semester, which needs to be over by Dec.”The CUET delay has pushed back the calendar by at least a fortnight for Central University of Gujarat (CUG), the only university in the state admitting students through the central test.Darshan Maru, controller of examination at CUG, toldthat the PG admissions are already done for 300-odd students, whereas admissions are pending for UG courses. “We have 100-odd seats in three disciplines where admissions take place through CUET. Last year too, these admissions had started in August,” he said."," CUET UG exams happened in May, results aren’t out yet. For universities and students, this is déjà vu.

The party has 11 Rajya Sabha members and four Lok Sabha MPs at present.Given the situation, the INDIA bloc of parties did not waste an opportunity on Wednesday to reach out to YSRCP, which can be seen as an attempt to increase numbers in the opposition benches, instead the treasury benches gaining from it.That the ruling NDA stands short of majority in Rajya Sabha at present, makes it inevitable for BJP to try for the extra numbers from the unaligned parties, to pass Bills and motions in the House.While Naveen Patnaik’s BJD like YSRCP, had remained unattached from ruling or opposition coalitions earlier, and voted with the BJP government, after the June 4 defeat, for both parties in their respective states, BJD has announced going with the opposition parties.With the recent trend of MPs jumping ship from opposition to ruling sides, YSRCP is also alert on keeping its flock together, and not lose them to TDP or BJP, who would want to increase its strength in the House.Speaking at the dharna, Yadav said, ""I would not have known the truth had I not seen the photographs and videos. Those in power should maintain simplicity, listen to others, and not take their lives."" Raut called for an “independent investigation” and several leaders, including Haq and Chaturvedi, urged the governor of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court to take note of the matter.In response, TDP MPs held a press conference and accused Reddy of ""diversion politics"".

The district horticulture department of Gorakhpur is also contributing to the efforts.T Damodaran, Director, CISH, said that the institute aims to enhance the yield and quality of Paniyala.Additionally, gardeners will receive canopy management training, facilitating orchard maintenance.Paniyala has grown abundantly in Purvanchal till six decades ago. However, today, it is found only in Gorakhpur, Deoria, and Maharajganj districts. The fruit is known for its unique flavour, which is sour, sweet, and slightly astringent. Besides its distinctive flavor, Paniyala is valued for its medicinal properties.In order to enhance the production and quality of Paniyala, scientists from CISH surveyed Paniyala-dominant areas of Gorakhpur and nearby districts last year.The fruits will undergo physical and chemical analysis in the institute's laboratory to assess their diversity. The best trees will be selected for preservation, and new plants will be produced through grafting to make them available to farmers and gardeners.This year, around Dussehra, when Paniyala is in peak season, the team will return to collect high-quality fruits for evaluation. The best specimens will be used to establish nurseries, which will then be supplied to farmers.""The organization will assist farmers with technology and market access,"" said the director.Paniyala is known for its antibacterial properties, which are found in its leaves, bark, roots, and fruits. These properties make it beneficial for various stomach ailments, dental issues, bleeding gums, coughs, pneumonia, and itching. Additionally, the fruit is helpful for liver diseases and contains several antioxidants.During the Chhath festival in eastern UP, the fruit is sold at a high price of up to Rs 400 per kg. In recognition of its value, the centre is working to designate it as a geographical indicator of Gorakhpur. Paniyala can also be preserved as jam, jelly, or juice, extending its shelf life. It is valuable for wood, fuel, and agricultural uses.GI tagging is poised to be a game-changer for Paniyala, a fruit that is a treasure trove of medicinal properties. This designation is expected to ignite a surge in its demand, potentially catapulting it to the status of a distinguished product of Gorakhpur, akin to the revered Terracotta.SP Singh, senior horticulture scientist at Krishi Vigyan Kendra Belipar (Gorakhpur), said that the benefits of GI tagging would extend beyond Gorakhpur and benefit farmers from Deoria, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Bahraich, Gonda, and Shravasti, the districts which share the same agroclimatic zone, resulting in similar agricultural product qualities.The GI tag legally protects regional agricultural products, preventing unauthorized use and enhancing their significance. It also acts as a trademark on the international stage, boosting exports and increasing local income.Paniyala farming yields higher profits compared to traditional crops. The trees grow to about nine meters in height, making them relatively easy to maintain.","Paniyala has grown abundantly in Purvanchal till six decades ago.

A delegation comprising 12 members (6 each from SKM NP and KMM) met Rahul Gandhi accompanied by Jairam Ramesh, KC Venugopal and Congress MPs from Punjab for over half an hour in parliament on Wednesday.The farmers apprised about their demands which included apart from MSP and debt waiver, no inquiry into the killing of protester Shubhkaran Singh by SIT headed by a police official from Haryana, action against Haryana cops for lobbing tear gas shells on protesting farmers and to withdraw the orders of Haryana government to honour six police officials who stopped farmers at Punjab-Haryana borders.“We explained every detail about their demand about legal right of MSP and debt waiver to Rahul Gandhi, who listened attentively.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming that he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child. In a recent interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk described the experience as a ""trick"" and blamed the ""woke mind virus"" for his son's transition.Musk's child, Xavier, who now identifies as Vivian Jenna Wilson, underwent a name and gender change in 2022.Musk asserts that he was pressured into approving puberty blockers for Xavier under false pretenses, claiming that he was told the child was at risk of suicide.""I lost my son, essentially. They call it deadnaming for a reason,"" Musk said. ""The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.""After an extended pause, Musk added, ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.""Musk's comments have sparked intense debate over parental rights, transgender healthcare, and the influence of cultural and political ideologies on personal decisions. Critics argue that Musk's statements are harmful and stigmatizing to transgender individuals, while supporters contend that he is raising legitimate concerns about the medical treatment of minors.The controversy comes amid broader cultural tensions over issues of gender identity and parental rights. Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that will bar school districts from notifying parents if their child uses different pronouns or identifies as a gender that's different from what’s on school records.""This is the final straw,"" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, in explaining his decision. ""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child.
