SC: Negligence of even 0.001% in NEET must be examined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-negligence-of-even-0-001-in-neet-must-be-examined/articleshow/111094613.cms,"New Delhi: Observing that even 0.001% negligence in conducting NEET-UG must be examined thoroughly, Supreme Court on Tuesday said Centre and National Testing Agency ( NTA ) should admit if there had been any mistake in organising the test and rectify it, instead of denying it.As allegations of mismanagement and question paper leak marred the medical entrance examination taken by over 24 lakh candidates and against which students in different parts of the country are holding protests, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and SVN Bhatti expressed concern over students indulging in illegal and corrupt means to get admission in MBBS courses and said this was ""deleterious to society"".The bench said timely action should be taken by authorities in such cases as children put a lot of hard work for the exam and their interests should be protected. ""Even if there is 0.001% negligence on the part of anyone, it should be thoroughly dealt with. All these matters ought not to be treated as adversarial litigation,"" the bench said.""You must stand firm. If there is a mistake then admit there is a mistake and say this is the action we will take. At least that inspires confidence in your performance. One can easily find out what has gone wrong,"" it added.Advocate Kanu Aggarwal, appearing for the Centre, said the govt was alive to the problem and that was why the decision to award grace marks to 1,563 students was withdrawn and a retest was ordered. He further said the Centre was not taking the litigation initiated by students as adversarial but cautioned against drawing any conclusion until the govt and the NTA had filed their response.Appearing for a group of 32 medical aspirants from different parts of the country who took the test on May 5, advocate Kunal Cheema urged the bench to seek a status report from Bihar police which is investigating the paper leak case. He said the report would be very helpful in deciding the case.However, the bench said all aspects of the case would be heard along with a batch of other petitions on July 8, including on seeking a status report. The court issued fresh notices to Centre and NTA asking them to file their response within two weeks.Praying for re-examination, the petition additionally said to the court, ""The petitioners and their family members have put in years of preparation for the examination, with the hopes that they would get into a good govt college on a free seat. However, the question paper leak as reported in the media and upon perusal of the contents of the press release, it has become amply clear that the question paper leak has spread its tentacles all over the country and has resulted in grave injustice being caused to the petitioners.""Earlier, Centre and NTA admitted before the SC that it was a mistake to award grace marks to students. They reversed the decision and decided to conduct a fresh test for 1,563 students. NTA had awarded them compensatory marks.The aggrieved students did not get the full 3 hours and 20 minutes time and NTA had awarded them compensatory marks based on the recommendations of the grievance redressal committee.",Justices Vikram Nath and SVN Bhatti expressed concern over students indulging in illegal and corrupt means to get admission in MBBS courses. The bench said timely action should be taken by authorities as children put a lot of hard work for the exam and their interests should be protected.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111094626,imgsize-2088031,width-400,resizemode-4/111094626.jpg"

Bureau of Civil Aviation Security ( BCAS ) DG Zulfiquar Hasan Tuesday said the rising number of such incidents had prompted the agency to propose the action against those found guilty on this count. On Tuesday, too, a large number of airports got threat messages about explosives being hidden. However, the messages turned out to be hoax as thorough checks at these airports yielded nothing. ""Six people have already been arrested from across India so far for issuing these hoax threats. Investigations are on and we expect more arrests soon,"" Hasan said. Hoax messages cause major disruptions in flight schedules as aircraft, flyers & baggage have to be checked thoroughly.

Puri takes a ‘khata-khat’ jab at Rahul over Karnataka fuel price hike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/puri-takes-a-khata-khat-jab-at-rahul-over-karnataka-fuel-price-hike/articleshow/111065674.cms,"NEW DELHI: Oil minister Hardeep Puri on Monday hit out at the Congress government in Karnataka for raising fuel prices by Rs 3 a litre, saying the people are being made to pay for the freebie follies of the party’s “young leader” — an indirect reference to Rahul Gandhi ’s campaign promise of annual dole for women if the party was voted to power at the Centre.“It was a question of credibility before the Karnataka government . They made bus ride free and given free this and free that. Now they needed money to fulfil the khata-khat, khata-khat promise made by their young leader during (LS) poll campaign. So they decided to raise fuel prices, making people pay for the scheme,” Puri said without naming Rahul.The Congress had promised to launch annual social security dole of Rs 1 lakh if voted to power at the Centre. Rahul’s use of ‘khata-khat’, a colloquial expression for quick or immediately, caught the fancy of voters during the campaign. Thermal Congress had also promised a Rs 2,000 monthly payout for women during the May 2023 assembly election.Puri said the party had distributed pamphlets looking like some guarantee document during the (LS) poll campaign. “Women are landing up to claim their first instalment of Rs 8,500,” he said.On fuel prices being still higher in several states where BJP and/or its allies are in power, Puri said the hikes were affected by previous dispensations. On why the BJP and its allies are not bringing down the prices by paring state levies, he said many BJP-ruled states had done so in the past, matching the Centre’s excise duty reduction.Petrol, for example costs Rs 106.45 a litre in Bhopal, Rs 105.16 in Patna (BJP in coalition with JD-U), Rs 104.86 in Jaipur and Rs 104.19 in Mumbai. Even after the June 15 increase in state levies from 25.92% to 29.84% on petrol and from 14.3% to 18.4% on diesel, fuel in Karnataka is still cheaper than neighbouring states.",Oil minister Hardeep Puri hit out at the Congress government in Karnataka for raising fuel prices by Rs 3 a litre.

For the remaining nine, we have got details from NTA on the basis of their roll code and have sent notices to these candidates to join our investigation from next week. Of these nine candidates, one each is from UP and Maharashtra, and seven from different districts of Bihar,” Dhillon said.Dhillon claimed that four arrested candidates had “confessed” during interrogation that the examination questions were identical to those they had received at the “safe house” on May 4.“After the results were out, we found that all four had passed,” one investigator said. After the 13 candidates entered the rented flat, their phones were taken away to stop them from contacting anyone or telling their friends about the questions. The mafia also dropped the students at their respective centres in their vehicles.“The aspirants disclosed their parents had given Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh each to the mafia for the question papers.","Bihar Police sent notices on Saturday to students in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar to join the investigation into alleged malpractice in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-Undergraduate) Police said they had evidence that the exam papers were leaked.

Acknowledging that the location of the station - in the middle of two rural rail stations and at least a kilometre's trek along tea plantations and agricultural fields from Phansidewa Road - was a constraint, they said they had reached the spot as early as they could. The locals of Nirmal Jote, where the incident occurred, insisted the rescue team arrived late and pointed out that many of the injured were taken to hospitals in e-rickshaws, as ambulances had arrived much later.Md Hasim, one of the locals who had rushed to the spot along with his friends, said they used chisels and hammers to pry open doors and evacuate passengers stuck inside. Also, because it had been raining, most coach windows were shut. ""We used kitchen utensils like tongs to open the windows and take out the wounded,"" he said.""I cut my hand while rescuing a passenger who was stuck. There were no ambulances. Local youths hired private vehicles and sent the injured to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital,"" said Md Rahul.An NDRF officer said they were alerted about the accident at 10.05am.

""There were three bodies - that of the loco pilot and co-pilot of the goods carriage and that of the guard of Kanchenjunga Express - that were caught in a mangled mess.

"'Under the glare of cameras ... ': Kharge takes dig at Modi govt's railway minister; BJP hits back with statistics, says 'stop lecturing'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-the-glare-of-cameras-kharge-takes-dig-at-modi-govts-railway-minister-bjp-hits-back-with-statistics-says-stop-lecturing/articleshow/111089360.cms,"Kharge's 7 questions to Modi government:

Why was not even one km of ""Kavach protection"", the anti-train collision system, added after a major train accident like Balasore?

Why are 3 lakh posts empty in railways and nothing has been done to fill them up in the last 10 years?

NCRB report of 2022 states that 1 lakh people have died in train accidents between 2017 and 2021. Who is responsible for these deaths? Railway Board has admitted that lack of manpower has forced loco pilots to work long hours and this is the reason for increased train accidents. Why have the vacant posts not been filled?

Why was the Commission on Railway Safety (CRS) not empowered? The Parliamentary Standing Committee had in its 323rd report criticised the railway board for ignoring the recommendations of CRS. It was underlined that the CRS investigates only 8%-10% of accidents.

According to the CAG, 75% of funding was reduced in 'Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh' (RRSK) whereas the mandate was to provide Rs 20,000 crore every year. Why are railway officials using this fund for needless expenditure and other amenities on comfort of passengers?

Why travelling in sleeper class has become so costly? Why have the number of sleeper coaches in trains reduced? Last year 2.7 crore people had to cancel their tickets due to unavailability of seats - which was a direct consequence of Modi government's decision to reduce sleeper coaches.

Did Modi government integrate railways budget with the general Budget in 2017-2018 to escape accountability?

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday claimed that there was significant reduction in the number of train accidents in the last 10 years even as the Congress alleged neglect of safety by railways and sought resignation of Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw after the Kanchanjunga train accident which left 10 people dead and several injured.The Kanchanjunga Express was hit by a goods train at Rangapani near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal on Monday morning. At least four rear coaches of the train were severely damaged in the collision.Senior BJP leader Amit Malviya, in a post on X, claimed that the number of train accidents under NDA rule was one-third of the accidents that happened under the Congress-led UPA. The BJP leader shared a graphic titled ""Congress should stop lecturing on rail accidents' which claimed that there were 1711 rail accidents between 2004 and 2014 when UPA was in power compared to 678 accidents from 2014 to 2024 under the BJP-ruled NDA government.Amit Malviya also compared the amount spent on railway safety in the same period by the two governments. He said UPA had spent Rs 1.64 lakh crore from 2004 to 2014 while NDA had spent Rs 8.26 lakh crore between 2014 and 2024 on safety.The BJP leader, in another post, targeted the Congress chief and listed 9 rail accidents that happened in 2013-2014 when Kharge was the railways minister in UPA government.Malviya's retort came after Kharge accused the Modi government of ""destroying""Indian Railways and posed seven questions. Kharge said Vaishnaw has no moral right to continue as a minister. ""Whenever there is a train accident, Modi government's railway minister reaches the spot under the glare of cameras and behaves as if everything is fine. Narendra Modi ji, tell us who should be held accountable, the Railway Minister or you?"" the Congress chief asked.Kharge, in his post, said ""Self-glorification will not undo the criminal negligence perpetrated by the Modi government on the Indian Railways! Accountability needs to be fixed at the top.""",The BJP claimed that there was significant reduction in the number of train accidents in the last 10 years.

'A hill palace of Rs 500 crore': TDP accuses former CM Jagan Reddy of misusing public money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-hill-palace-of-rs-500-crore-tdp-accusses-former-cm-jagan-reddy-of-misusing-people-money/articleshow/111089643.cms,"Bathtub alone costs Rs 26 lakhs: TDP

Attempts to portray it as Jagan Reddy's house: YSRCP

Emblem of luxury rather than a conventional tourism hub

NEW DELHI: N Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) accused the ousted YS Jagan Mohan Reddy 's YSRCP government of building a hilltop palace in Vishakhapatnam , also known as Vizag, in secrecy behind large barricades.TDP claimed the luxurious property, located on Rushikonda Hill, was meant to serve as a camp office for Jagan Reddy , who had previously declared Vizag as the capital of Andhra Pradesh."" Rushikonda Palace is the most luxurious palace in the country. Jagan built this palace with Rs 500 crore people's money with whose permission? People of AP say that a deep investigation should be done on this,"" TDP wrote on X.""Rushikonda Palace incident alone is enough to know how much good people have done to the state by defeating Jagan. Look at how much effort he had to occupy a hill in Visakha and built a palace with Rs.500 crores of public money!""TDP claimed that the bathtub installed at the property alone costs Rs 26 lakhs. ""For the wife's wish, a palace worth Rs 500 crores, with a view of the beach and the sea in the north-east. The bathtub alone costs Rs.26 lakhs. Again he made jokes about the poor and beggars and deprived the poor of their homes.""""When his wife asked him to buy the Beach View Palace, he broke all the rules, wasted hundreds of crores of public money, and now come and tell stories? But what are the pictures of that bathroom, is it so big? What did you actually plan? Who did you sketch for?,"" wrote TDP.""The Italian marble and tiles used in Rushikonda Palace are mind blowing. For the cost per foot of these Italian marbles, a middle-class person can afford a small-sized apartment. This is the beach view palace built by Jagan Reddy in Rushikonda with the materials used for royal prasadas built by heads of state,"" said TDP in another tweet, sharing pictures.YSRCP leader and former minister Gudivada Amarnath said that TDP is attempting to wrongly influence the people of the state. ""We have been seeing attempts to change the people of the state since yesterday. It does not make sense to stop looking at how to use it when the Governor, President and other dignitaries come in the coming days and still portray it as YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's house.""Those in Rushikonda are government buildings, asserted YSRCP. ""They are not private property. They do not belong to anyone. These buildings were constructed keeping in mind the priority given to Visakhapatnam by the previous government. It is up to the government how to use them. People are noticing the motives behind going into such government buildings and taking pictures and trying to smear them with distortions. Even since 1995, Chandrababu has been boasting that Visakhapatnam is the financial capital. He has become the chief minister four times so far. Realize that even if a Prime Minister comes to Visakhapatnam, a President comes, a chief minister goes, or people like the Governor go, there is no proper building to host them. Going inside the buildings of Rushikonda Resorts and taking pictures and displaying bile may give you emotional satisfaction, but the people of Visakhapatnam are not doing so!""In response, TDP asked why it was kept hidden from the public if they were government buildings. ""If they are buildings built for the President and Prime Minister, why did they put barbed wire fences these days? Why did you hide it away from people? Why did you hide the courts? Why are you saying that these are tourism buildings, but now that they have been found, it is the President's building and the Prime Minister's building? If the buildings were built for the President and the Prime Minister, why did the relatives of Jagan Reddy's wife go and pray there?"" When TOI visited the facility on Sunday , the first time the site has been opened to visitors, it seemed that the design and development of the buildings appeared to align with the idea of the CM potentially staying and managing affairs from there.Early reviews suggest the seven-block structure deviates from traditional tourist accommodations. The design features architectural splendor and a level of sophistication reminiscent of a high-end corporate office or a prestigious government building.The facility, built at nearly Rs 450 crore, might not be suitable as a star hotel in its current form. Specific modifications could be required to convert it into a tourist resort or a private luxury hotel.Though the complex was developed on a 9.9-acre site on Rushikonda, it now symbolizes luxury more than a typical tourism hub. The blocks feature banquet facilities, state-of-the-art conference halls, wide corridors, and impressive lighting.Sophistication is evident with premium electrical appliances, luxurious bathroom fittings, and several automated features, some operated by biometric technology. To build this new facility, the previous government demolished the existing structure, which was in excellent condition and generating significant revenue for the government.","YSRCP leader and former minister Gudivada Amarnath said that TDP is attempting to wrongly influence the people of the state.

""Congratulations to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his electoral victory. Canada stands ready to work with his government to advance the relationship between our nations' peoples—anchored to human rights, diversity, and the rule of law,"" Trudeau had said on social media.

Roads ministry eyes Cabinet nod to free up 700ha surplus land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/roads-ministry-eyes-cabinet-nod-to-free-up-700ha-surplus-land/articleshow/111094187.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its bid to free up two sets of surplus land totalling around 700 hectares , road transport ministry will soon seek cabinet approval to denotify land parcels where govt has not taken possession even after a long time since the acquisition process was initiated. In the second set, where excess land is available even after completion of highway projects , the ministry plans to use them for developing wayside amenities , including resting facilities for drivers.

Sources said the ministry is giving final touches to the policy. As per the proposed policy, after denotifying the first set of surplus land, it will allow owners to take them back. TOI has learned that the quantum of such land parcels is around 350 hectares. Officials said due to change in lane configuration or tweaking of alignment, govt ends up acquiring less land. But once govt issues a 3D notification to notify affected landowners about its intention to acquire land for a specific project, it is impossible for them to sell their land or monetise them.

The ministry will seek one-time relief for de-notification of such land parcels. Since the value of such land parcels would have gone up for their proximity to the highway network, govt expects landowners to take them back.

Armed forces formulate new doctrine for cyberspace operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms,"NEW DELHI: The armed forces have formulated a new joint doctrine for cyberspace operations , which have become critical in modern-day warfare, especially in the backdrop of China developing potent cyber-warfare and cyber-espionage capabilities.The doctrine, which was released by chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan in the presence of the three Service chiefs on Tuesday, is a ""keystone publication"" that will guide commanders in planning and conducting cyberspace operations in the current complex military operating environment, an officer said.China has built major capabilities in the cyberwarfare domain, including cyberweapons to degrade or destroy an adversary's military assets and strategic networks as well as energy, banking, transport and communication grids even before the actual kinetic war kicks off, as reported by TOI earlier.India has been lagging far behind in this arena, with the govt in 2019 only approving the creation of only a small tri-service Defence Cyber Agency instead of the full-fledged Cyber Command that the armed forces wanted.The officer said the new joint doctrine is ""a significant step"" to give impetus to the ongoing process of integration being actively pursued by the Army, IAF and Navy.""In addition to the traditional domains of land, sea and air, cyberspace has emerged as a crucial and challenging domain in modern warfare. Hostile actions in cyberspace can impact the nation's economy, cohesion, political decision-making, and the country's ability to defend itself,"" he said. ""Operations in cyberspace need to be dovetailed into the national security fabric, to evolve the 'Ends,' 'Ways' and 'Means' to create advantage and influence events in all other operational environments and across all instruments of power,"" he further added.The doctrine comes at a time when the Army is operationalising dedicated specialised units in each of its six operational or regional commands to handle the cyberspace domain.The Army says these Command Cyber Operations and Support Wings will help to safeguard its networks and increase the preparedness levels in this dimension of warfare. ""It will lead to overall strengthening of the Army's cyber-security posture for both conventional operations as well as grey zone warfare,"" an officer said.","The doctrine is a ""keystone publication"" that will guide commanders in planning and conducting cyberspace operations. China has built major capabilities in the cyberwarfare domain, including cyberweapons to degrade or destroy an adversary's military assets and strategic networks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111094186,imgsize-1456643,width-400,resizemode-4/111094186.jpg"

7 trains had passed that stretch before accident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-trains-had-passed-that-stretch-before-accident/articleshow/111094116.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid debate over whether loco pilot was at fault or signalling system was behind the fatal accident in West Bengal, officials said seven trains , including the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train which rammed it, were issued authority letters to pass the defective automatic signalling system. Barring the goods train, the other six had passed with the paper authority or T/A-912 following the speed restriction .Officials said the loco pilot and assistant loco pilot of the goods train had joined duty after more than 30 hours rest. Giving details of procedure followed in such cases where automatic signal fails and paper pass is issued, an official said a train is made to stop at the foot of each signal for 1 minute in the day and 2 minutes at night.""Thereafter, the train can proceed towards the next stop signal exercising great caution so as to stop short of any obstruction with a speed not exceeding 15 kmph in case of good visibility and 10 kmph when the visibility is not good,"" he added. Though a detailed inquiry will establish the exact cause of the accident, railway officials said it seemed the loco pilot of the goods train did not observe the condition of stopping for 2 minutes before the red signal and did not follow the 15 kmph speed restriction.An official said Kanchanjunga Express had stopped before red signal when the goods train rammed it. Officials said automatic signalling is installed on double or multiple line sections having high traffic density to be able to carry more trains with minimum detention.Signal failure occurred between Rangapani and Chetterhat stations at 5.50 am on Monday and this was communicated to the signal department. The signal department did not declare the failure as ""prolonged failure"" and hence automatic block system continued to be in force.","Seven trains, including the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train which rammed it, were issued authority letters to pass the defective automatic signalling system.
