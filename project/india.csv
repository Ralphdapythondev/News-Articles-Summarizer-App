"‘Daro mat,’ Modi taunts Rahul as he picks Rae Bareli",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daro-mat-modi-taunts-rahul-as-he-picks-rae-bareli/articleshow/109826271.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the past few days, Rahul Gandhi would consistently claim that PM Narendra Modi was running scared and was on the verge of breaking down. On Friday, it was the PM’s turn to tell the Congress leader that the taunt was on him. With Rahul choosing to vacate Amethi for the ""safer Rai Bareli"", Modi led BJP leaders in mocking him, spraying him with ""daro mat (don't be afraid), bhaago mat (don't run away) barbs that Rahul had hurled against him.“Today, I want to tell him (Rahul), daro mat, bhaago mat,” Modi said at a rally in Bardhaman in Bengal soon after Rahul gave in to relentless persuasion from his colleagues to contest from Rai Bareli.Modi quickly projected Rahul’s decision to vacate Amethi, which he had lost to Smriti Irani in 2019, as a pointer to BJP’s third consecutive landslide, while also saying that the decision to contest from Rai Bareli showed the Congress leader's jitters about his prospects in Wayanad in Kerala. “Many media personalities and experts continue to speculate about the election outcome. There is no longer any need for opinion polls or exit polls, the country's voice is clear. The only question that still remains unsettled is whether we are going to cross the 400 mark,"" he added.Modi asserted that Congress’s tally in the Lok Sabha polls would be an “all-time low”, and the party would struggle to cross even the “half century” mark. Congress’s lowest tally was in 2014 when it bagged 44 seats. In 2019, it managed 52.Taking a swipe at Sonia Gandhi for moving to the Rajya Sabha, the PM said he had mentioned earlier that the most prominent opposition leader would be too afraid to contest and she fled in fear. “She ran off to Rajasthan and entered Rajya Sabha from there,” he said. “I had already predicted that Congress's ‘shehzada’ would lose in Wayanad and, fearing defeat, he would immediately start looking for another seat once voting in Wayanad concluded,” he added.Continuing BJP’s onslaught, home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Chikkodi in Karnataka that Sonia’s bids to “launch” Rahul had failed in the past and would happen again. “Sonia Gandhi tried to launch Rahul 20 times but failed every time. This time around, he is going to be launched for the 21st time. He is contesting from Rae Bareli instead of Amethi out of fear of loss. I am going to predict the mandate here. Rahul Gandhi is going to face a crushing defeat in Rae Bareli,” he said.BJP also took a dig at Congress for not fielding Priyanka Gandhi from Amethi. “It is clear as daylight that Rahul Gandhi’s camp doesn’t want his sister to rise, lest she outshine him. How this sibling struggle for power within Congress plays out remains to be seen. But for now, Priyanka has lost out again,” BJP IT department chief Amit Malviya said.","Rahul Gandhi claimed that PM Narendra Modi was running scared and was on the verge of breaking down.

Lok Sabha elections: Why Rahul Gandhi opted for Rae Bareli and not Amethi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-why-rahul-gandhi-opted-for-rae-bareli-and-not-amethi/articleshow/109824406.cms,"'No prestige battle'

'Safe seat for Congress'

Alliance with Samajwadi Party

NEW DELHI: The suspense around Congress’s picks for Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats finally ended on Friday. And yes, one of the Gandhis is in the fray in politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, as a senior party leader A K Antony had stated almost a month back. But there are some twists to the tale. As was widely expected, Rahul Gandhi has decided not to return to Amethi and Priyanka Gandhi will not be making her poll debut from Rae Bareli.Instead, the Congress has fielded Rahul from Rae Bareli, a seat vacated by his mother Sonia Gandhi , who opted out of electoral politics and is now a member of Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan. There was anticipation that a member of the Gandhi family would be fielded to take forward Sonia’s legacy in Rae Bareli, which she represented for 20 long years.So, why did Rahul opt for Rae Bareli and not Amethi?Rahul Gandhi is already in the middle of tackling perhaps what can be called his toughest political challenge. After leading the grand old party to two humiliating successive Lok Sabha defeats, the former Congress chief faces a daunting task of ensuring that the party rebounds in these elections and increases its seat tally to a respectable level. In 2014, the Congress won 44 Lok Sabha seats – the lowest ever by the party and in 2019 the party could manage only 52 seats.Amethi, which for long was a Gandhi bastion, is no more a cakewalk for the Congress. In 2019, Smriti Irani defeated Rahul Gandhi to bring to an end his 15-year stint in the constituency. The BJP has fielded Smriti again, and in her, Rahul and the Congress would have had a tough challenger. If Rahul had decided to contest from Amethi, it would have turned into a ""prestige battle"" and the Congress leader would have had to focus all his energy and resources on the seat. A second successive defeat in Amethi would have meant a great loss of face for the leader and the party.Rae Bareli has been represented by Sonia Gandhi for 20 long years. It was the only seat that the Congress had won in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 Lok Sabha elections . In fact, after Independence, barring three occasions, the Congress has been continuously winning the seat. Rahul would hope that the voters of Rae Bareli continue with their support for the party. He has already called Rae Bareli the ""karmabhoomi of the family"" and has sought the love and blessings of voters.Uttar Pradesh is one of the few states where the Congress could manage a tie-up well in advance and without much of trouble. The party is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state in alliance with Samajwadi Party. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress would hope that tie-up with Akhilesh Yadav helps the grand old party in this important seat. Of the five assembly seats that come under Rae Bareli, four -- Bachhrawan (SC), Harchandpur, Sareni and Unchahar -- are held by the Samajwadi Party.It remains to be seen if Rahul Gandhi's strategy of opting for Rae Bareli proves to be successful. For now, he is under intense opposition fire for dumping Amethi for Rae Bareli.","The suspense around Congress’s picks for Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats finally ended on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Following weeks of speculation, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday submitted his nomination for the Lok Sabha elections from Rae Bareli.

We must be open to you, because neither side should be taken by surprise. Do not assume anything, do not read anything into it,” the bench said and asked both sides to come prepared on May 7.It asked additional solicitor general S V Raju to seek instructions from ED regarding the conditions which should be imposed if interim bail is granted. “This case may take time… we may consider the question of interim bail, because of the elections,” the bench told the ASG. The court is left with only two weeks before going into summer recess. Opposing the proposition of interim bail, Raju told the bench that AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who was earlier granted bail in the excise case, was making all sorts of statements after coming out of jail.The court said it would hear the ASG before grant of any relief and asked senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi whether Kejriwal would be signing any files as he’s Delhi CM.Voting for the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for May 25, while polling in Punjab is in the last phase on June 1.

"Furnish data on GST notices & arrests, SC directs Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/furnish-data-on-gst-notices-arrests-sc-directs-centre/articleshow/109825924.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked Centre to furnish details of issuance of notices and arrests done under the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax, saying it may interpret the law and lay down appro-priate guidelines to avoid any har-assment of citizens by depriving their liberty.A special bench of justices Sanjeev Khanna, MM Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi, which is hearing a batch of 281 petitions challenging various provisions of the GST Act, Customs Act and provisions of PMLA, voiced concern over the ambiguity in section 69 of the GST Act that deals with the powers of arrest.The bench said it would interpret the law to “strengthen” the liberty, if need be, but not allow citizens to be harassed.“You furnish the data on notices issued and arrests made under the GST Act for alleged defaults of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore respectively for the past three years. There can be harassment of people and we won’t permit that. If we find there is ambiguity in the provision, we will set it right. Second, people can’t be sent behind bars in all the cases,” the bench told additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for Centre.The bench sought the data after senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for some of the petitioners flagged the alleged misuse of the powers of the authorities under the GST regime, saying it is curtailing the liberty of individuals.During the hearing on Thursday, Luthra pointed out that sometimes arrests are not made, but people are “harassed” by issuing notices to them, threatening arrest. He highlighted that arrest under the GST Act is to be preceded by adjudication of the amount considered due and payable on the part of a taxpayer.Luthra said the question which needs to be considered is whether the liberty of an individual can be curtailed under section 69 until the assessment is made and amount is quantified.Raju said he will gather data regarding notices and arrests made under the central GST Act but such information relating to states would be difficult to collate. The bench said, “We want all the data. The GST Council will have those data. If the data is available, we want it before us,” the bench told Raju, adding there has to be a distinction between cases of fraud and inadvertent lapses.","The Supreme Court has asked Centre to furnish details of issuance of notices and arrests done under the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax.

Jingle vs jungle jibe: Tejashwi Yadav’s musical counter to PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jingle-vs-jungle-jibe-tejashwis-musical-counter-to-modi/articleshow/109825922.cms,"PATNA: During the 2019 poll campaign, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had gone to voters with the “Chowkidar **** ***” slogan, which ultimately proved counterproductive for the opposition alliance. This time round, his ally and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a 1990s’ Bollywood number, “Tum to dhokebaaz ho, wada karke bhool jaate ho.”And, he appears to be striking a chord with voters.Dressed in his trademark white kurta-pyjama with a big RJD election symbol (lantern) embossed on it, Tejashwi has been singing this popular number from the GovindaKarisma starrer, ‘Saajan Chale Sasural’, at almost every election rally. Not only this, he has been playing audio clips of the PM’s past speeches promising to “grant special attention to Bihar, giving two crore jobs to youths every year, bringing back black money allegedly stashed in foreign banks and taming surging inflation” to drive home his point.Unlike Rahul’s ‘chowkidar’ jibe, Tejashwi has been successful in attacking Modi without getting too personal. Such has been its impact that people are attending his rallies in large numbers, braving the scorching sun. At the moment, Tejashwi, 35, seems to be waging a lone electoral battle against the army of mighty NDA leaders like PM Modi, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, J P Nadda, Yogi Adityanath and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar , who went to the NDA fold after breaking with the Grand Alliance barely three months ago.Only two top Congress leaders — Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi — have come here since the elections started, leaving the responsibility of opposition poll campaign solely on the shoulders of Tejashwi. Although RJD president Lalu Prasad figures among the list of the party’s 40 star campaigners, he was seen sharing stage only with his daughter, Rohini Acharya, who is making a poll debut from Saran Lok Sabha seat this time. In fact, Lalu’s multiple health complications do not permit him to walk freely and address rallies in this hot and humid weather, with the temperature rising to 45 degrees Celsius.On the other hand, Nitish has been unsparing in his attacks on Lalu, questioning his move to bear so many children, promoting his family in politics and indulging in corruption. However, Tejashwi has preferred not to hit back. “Nitish ji mere liye adarniya hain, abhibhawak hain. Wo kuchh bhi kah sakte hain. Wo jo bhi kahenge, mere liye ashirwad hoga (Nitish is like a guardian. I consider his words a blessing),” is all that Tejashwi says when asked about Nitish’s comments about his family. Apparently, Tejashwi’s focus on granting government jobs during his 17-month tenure in the second Nitish-led Grand Alliance govt, where he was deputy CM, has made him the darling of young voters.However, Nitish says the jobs were given because of him. Such is Tejashwi’s popularity that every Grand Alliance candidate wants him to campaign for them. According to RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav, Tejashwi has so far addressed 92 election rallies in the state. At his rallies, Tejashwi has been focusing on three key issues giving jobs to youths, taming inflation and putting a check on migration. Although there is no official data available about people working outside the state, Bihar govt had transferred Rs 1,000 each to the bank accounts of around 35 lakh migrant labourers during the nationwide lockdown due to Covid in April 2020. The figure amply explains the pangs of migration.Analysts say Tejashwi became the party’s star campaigner due to certain political compulsions. First, he had to lead the poll campaigns single-handedly in 2019 as his father was in jail after his conviction in the multi-crore fodder scam cases. Tejashwi shone during the 2020 Bihar assembly elections when he launched intensive poll campaigns and took on the mighty Nitish and his NDA colleagues then, addressing as many as 16-19 election rallies in a single day.The end result was startling as RJD emerged as the single-largest party in the 243-member Bihar assembly, while Nitish’s JD(U) was relegated to a distant third, marking the beginning of JD(U)’s downfall that still continues. Tejashwi was first seen sharing stage with party leaders during the 2009 LS polls when Lalu was facing the toughest battle of his political career from Saran LS seat and his wife Rabri Devi, former Bihar CM, joined the poll campaign in his support.Saran was earlier known as Chhapra before delimitation in 2009. It was then that Tejashwi started following his mother at election rallies. At that time, Tejashwi was often spotted following his mother on the stage and standing silently behind her.He graduated into politics after the party fielded him from Raghopur in the 2015 assembly elections. He won and became deputy CM in the first Nitish-led Grand Alliance govt formed in the state in Nov 2015. But the govt fell barely 20 months later as Nitish went back to NDA camp. The setback sharpened Tejashwi, and the change was palpable in his speech during the trust motion. The rest is history","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a 1990s’ Bollywood number, ‘Tum to dhokebaaz ho, wada karke bhool jaate ho’ He appears to be striking a chord with voters and people are attending his rallies in large numbers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109825916,imgsize-1452677,width-400,resizemode-4/109825916.jpg"

Four months after filing a petition and SC issuing notice on his bail plea in Elgar Parishad case, former DU professorFriday sought to withdraw his petition which was allowed by the court .Appearing before a bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal, Babu’s lawyer said that she wanted to withdraw the petition as there had been a change in circumstances as five co-accused have been granted bail.Allowing the plea, the court passed a brief order and said, “The counsel for the petitioner states that there is a change in the circumstance and she would not like to press the present petition and approach the high court… In view of the above, the petition is dismissed as not pressed”.Interestingly just a month back on April 5, a bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Augustine George Masih granted bail to 66-year old former Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen in the Elgar Parishad case, saying that all the allegations against her for indulging in terrorist activity and working for banned naxal outfit are prima facie not true.The apex court had on Jan 4 sought response from National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on bail plea of Babu who has been in custody since 2020 in the case.He approached the court after his bail plea was rejected by Bombay High Court in September last year.

will cross 400 by 1pm on June 4, Amit Shah says

NEW DELHI: Seeking to turn the tables on the opposition alliance over the Prajwal Revanna case, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday accused Karnataka deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar of allowing the JD(S) MP to leave the country as he reckoned that taking immediate action could cost Congress .“We have taken a clear stand. We must take the strictest steps and if Karnataka govt cannot, then let it be.We will take action. Until the vokkaliga voting was done, they suppressed the whole thing. And as soon as voting was over, they brought it out, and by then he had fled. I am telling you, if they had taken steps in time, he wouldn’t have been able to flee and would have been arrested,” Shah said.He pointed out that Shivakumar, the deputy CM, was a vokkaliga like Revanna. “The agency actually belongs to whom, in Karnataka it’s with Congress. They were supposed to investigate and would have known. I am clearly accusing. They suppressed it until the Vokkaliga voting was over,” he added.In an interview with Times Now Navbharat, Amit Shah justified the police investigation against those accused of circulating a video which was doctored to make it appear that he had called for scrapping Dalit quota, saying those who edit and distort videos to influence elections must be ready to face the consequences. “Police will investigate, and everyone should cooperate with the investigation. And then they will say no, no, no, the agencies have come upon us, and they start crying, so brother why did you edit? You cooperate now,” he said.Shah mocked the opposition for its allegations about EVMs being faulty, and said the voting machines were highly secure and could not be tampered with by any external force.“If they lose, they blame EVMs and if they win, they accept it wholeheartedly. Don’t take the oath after winning. After all, it is the same EVM? The faulty EVM . Should they be taking oath after winning with faulty EVMs? Rahul Gandhi should say whether he will take oath as the winner from Wayanad?” he added.To a question about BJP “playing politics” on alleged sexual oppression of women in Sandeshkhali in Bengal by TMC functionaries, Shah emphasised HC had ordered a CBI probe into the incident. “Is HC playing politics?” he asked, adding that it was the “height of appeasement” that the culprit accused of exploiting hundreds of women right under the nose of a woman CM was not arrested until the court order.He also justified former Calcutta HC judge Abhijit Gangopadhyay contesting the poll as a BJP candidate. He said hundreds of people, ministers in Indira Gandhi’s ministry had done this. “Any judicial officer, after leaving their job, can join any party. This is not the first time this has happened. But if we do it, the question only arises then,” he said.Asked about NDA’s ambitious aim of winning 400 seats, Shah said the alliance would definitely win 400 seats. “By 1pm on 4th June, the people will bless Narendra Modi for the third time as PM with a majority of over 400 seats,” he added.On the opposition’s allegations of foul play after BJP candidates got elected unopposed, he said so far 37 people had been elected unopposed, most of them from Congress. “What about when Yashwantrao Chavan won, when Farooq Abdullah won, when Dimple Yadav (SP boss Akhilesh Yadav’s wife), was elected unopposed. They cannot handle even people in their own parties and describe every defeat as an attack on democracy,” he said.About the party’s explorations in the south, Shah said BJP would be a bigger party than Congress. “In Tamil Nadu, BJP will open its account. We will also be elected in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka,” he said.","Amit Shah accuses Karnataka deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar of allowing the JD(S) MP to leave the country. “We have taken a clear stand.

A tale of ‘nowhere people’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-tale-of-nowhere-people/articleshow/109825188.cms,"Out of sight is out of mind. That’s precisely the tragic story of a Purvanchal

village

lost in its odd

location

between two districts.

Healthcare is scarce too

There is no piped water here

The oddity of its location makes Siura Gopalpur locus classicus – a classic place. It’s barely five kilometres from the Mau district border and 20 from Mau town. But the village of 1,600 voters presses the button for the Salempur Lok Sabha constituency, which is 50 km away in Deoria district.The fast-flowing Ghaghara, the second largest tributary of the Ganga, has long kept the electors from the elected. Few here remember which MP or MLA visited them the last. To exacerbate matters, the village doesn’t officially belong to either Mau or Deoria district – it is part of the Ballia district.The connection to three districts – through proximity, Lok Sabha and district administration – has been a bane. Village head Manoj Kumar said, “This is our dilemma. We are the ‘nowhere people ’.” Life for the residents of nearly 300 houses is challenging.The village has power cables, but no power. “Connections were provided on paper to people under Saubhagya Ujjwala on the basis of their Aadhaar cards in 2018. But many had no idea such a thing had been done. Mayhem followed when people later received power bills up to Rs 40,000. Villagers have stayed away from using power since then. And most people can’t even afford it,” said Kumar.Batteries are used to charge a few mobile phones people have here.The village has a road that was laid in 2007 under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and has since vanished. In the rainy season, villagers are cut off from the rest of the civilization for days in the absence of a metalled road.There is a primary health centre, five km away in Kasaundar, but no doctor. “A compounder administers medical advice at the PHC when any patient is brought in. In case of serious illness, patients need to be taken to the district govt hospital, which is in Ballia town. There is no good private hospital either in a radius of 30-40 km,” said Rohan Singh who lost his father a decade ago to complications arising out of typhoid and hepatitis that went undetected for days.There is no employment here and agriculture is mostly unreliable.Many years ago, a villager had gone to work in a factory in Chennai. Many have followed him since. A few other youngsters have also gone to the Middle East as skilled labourers.“For ages, we have not seen any MP or MLA visiting our village, not even for election campaigns. We don’t exist, we don’t matter,” said Bahadur Singh (71), grandfather of six. His two sons, Ram Milan and Raju, are semi-skilled labourers working in Saudi Arabia for a couple of years now. His third son is waiting for his elder brothers to arrange for a visa and help him land a job there.Vishal Chauhan (28), who is preparing to become a teacher, said, “The groundwater in the village has heavy metals, like iron, and arsenic. But villagers do not have a choice. We stop using water from hand pumps that give out coloured water and instead use water that appears relatively cleaner. Nobody from the district administration has ever come to the village to inspect which hand pumps are providing drinkable water.”Ironically, the former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar’s village Ibrahimpatti is just 18 km from Siura Gopalpur, and his son Neeraj Shekhar is Rajya Sabha member from BJP. Before that, he twice made it into Lok Sabha from Ballia constituency on the Samajwadi Party ticket after Chandra Shekhar’s death in 2007. He is now the BJP candidate from Ballia constituency this time. But that’s irrelevant in Siura Gopalpur – pretty much like the village itself that plunges into darkness soon after dawn. Nights here are longer.","Siura Gopalpur is barely five kilometres from the Mau district border and 20 from Mau town.

The deceased was identified as S Kasthuri, 22, a nursing graduate from Chennai, wife of Suresh Kumar from Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district.Relatives blamed the emergency chain that failed to work for the delay in rescuing and providing medical treatment to the woman and her subsequent death.Railway police while quoting her relatives said Kasthuri along with her husband and relatives left Chennai for Sankarankoil in Kollam Express on Thursday. The pregnant woman's baby shower ceremony was scheduled on Sunday at Sankarankoil. When the speeding express train crossed Ulundurpet railway station, Kasthuri complained of nausea and vomiting. She was assisted by one of her relatives to the door when she lost control and fell from the speeding train.Her relatives attempted to stop the train by pulling the emergency chain. They said the emergency chain in the compartment did not work, and they could not stop the train immediately. They rushed to the next compartment and pulled the emergency chain to stop the train. By then the train travelled almost 10km from where the pregnant woman fell. They got down and tried to trace Kasthuri. Their 20-minute search turned futile, and the train departed and reached Vridhachalam railway station.Her relatives went to Vridhachalam railway station and lodged a complaint with the railway police. A police team found her body along the tracks about 1km from Ulundurpet railway station after a three-hour search. Her relatives said Kasthuri could have been saved if the emergency chain in the compartment had worked and they could have rescued the injured woman and rushed her for immediate medical treatment. They pointed out that it took almost three hours to locate her after she fell from the train.Meanwhile, the district administration has ordered an inquiry by the RDO as the woman died within eight months of marriage to rule out any foul play in the tragic death of the woman.","The deceased was identified as S Kasthuri, 22, a nursing graduate from Chennai, wife of Suresh Kumar from Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district.

Pointing out the key reason for a common practice of people to throw plastic waste like packing material of pasteurised milk, chips, and edible oils, etc., Col Bindra said that, unlike old newspapers and cardboard sheets, polythene is generally not procured by junk dealers.“I will engage my social group, ‘Parivartan’, to set up a smooth network for selling waste polythene and plastic to let people earn money from other junk material. This will drastically reduce the scattering of polythene and plastic bottles on the city streets and the litter dumps,” he said.Inspired by the drive, chief priest of the temple, Vineet Bajpayi, said, “I will ensure that devotees do not litter in temple campus and rather contribute to maintaining sanitation.”","Several police personnel, including SP Avinash Pandey, ASP Vikram Dahiya, CO Deepak Chaturvedi, and over 150 constables participated in the drive along with 115 students from Goswami’s Moms Pride School.
