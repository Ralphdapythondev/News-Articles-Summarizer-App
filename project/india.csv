National Conference (NC) Vice President Omar Abdullah expressed optimism on Tuesday and hoped for a positive outcome as the election results were awaited.The NC leader also extended his best wishes to colleagues and allies, saying, “We fought the good fight & now, InshaAllah, the results will reflect that."" His remarks came at a critical juncture as the region awaits the final tally of votes following the recently concluded Assembly elections .A day earlier, Omar Abdullah had sought to deny rumours about the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) offering support to the National Conference.He emphasised the need to wait for the official results before jumping to conclusions and termed the speculations as premature. His comments were in response to his father, Farooq Abdullah ’s statement that the NC-Congress alliance might accept support from the PDP, even if it wasn’t required, as they should ""go ahead together.""He took the matter to social media platform X and wrote, “They haven’t extended support, they haven’t offered support and we don’t know what the voters have decided yet, so I really wish we could put a lid on all this premature speculation for the next 24 hours.”In the recently concluded Assembly elections, the Election Commission of India reported an overall voter turnout of 63.88 per cent across three phases. The final phase, held on October 1, saw a voter turnout of 69.69 per cent. This was the first Assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370, marking a significant moment in the Union Territory’s political landscape.The NC and Congress, as part of the INDIA-bloc , contested the elections jointly, while the PDP and BJP ran independently.Remarkably, the elections saw a notable rise in voter participation in regions previously marked by militancy and electoral boycotts.",National Conference (NC) Vice President Omar Abdullah expressed optimism on Tuesday and hoped for a positive outcome as the election results were awaited.

NGLV

NGLV Recovery & Reusability

BENGALURU: With India’s space mission expanding both in size and vision, the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is all geared up for the establishment of the third launch pad at its spaceport in Sriharikota.In an exclusive interview with TOI, Isro chairman S Somanath said: “We only have the second launch pad now. The first one was created for PSLV, but it can’t be used for GSLV as it cannot handle the cryogenic stage .When LVM-3 came, we re-engineered the second launch pad. Now, LVM-3 will also have a semi-cryo stage, and the human spaceflight initially has to happen there.”Pointing out that the second launch pad has been undergoing several improvements in the past two decades, Somanath said in case something happens to the second launch pad — an explosion, for instance — there won’t be a launch pad available for GSLV, and every programme will come to a standstill.“The primary objective of the third launch pad is to serve as a redundancy. Next is that we are moving to a new philosophy with the NGLV (New Generation Launch Vehicle); it is going to be integrated horizontally and tilted, not vertically. The launch pad must support this aspect. NGLV will be more liquid engine booster-based than solid engine, so the entire launch pad jet deflector design will change. Also, the entire stage testing will happen here and not at Mahendragiri. The launch pad will cater to all of this,” Somanath said.According to S Sivakumar, project director, NGLV, the need for the new rocket — a three-stage vehicle with a reusable first stage — comes in the wake of emerging technologies and the need to reduce launch costs, aside from the realisation that existing launch vehicles cannot meet future demands.“Current operational vehicles cannot meet future requirements because we are targeting a 20-tonne payload capacity to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) from LVM-3’s capacity of 9.2 tonnes. The target for Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) is 9 tonnes compared to the current 4.3 tonnes,” he said.“Both are possible, but both have penalties. For example, the vehicle already has a velocity to move away from land, and you have to kill all the velocity and bring it back to the launch site; you will need a lot of fuel, which means you’ll have lower payload capability,” Somanath said.He added: “Initially, you need to do that on land only because sea-based recovery is costly, and you won’t have such a platform available readily. Later, once you have confidence, you move to the sea and land it there. Both capabilities are there. When you do it at sea, you will get a higher payload.”On the NGLV’s reusability, Sivakumar said that while both vertical and horizontal landing options are available, the first stage needs to have a horizontal landing or a wing-body supported vertical landing. “Otherwise, the structural mass will be enormous,” he said in his talk on transportation vehicles on Oct 6.While the establishment of the launch pad got the National Space Commission nod at the 153rd meeting of the panel ahead of the Sept 18 Cabinet meeting, which cleared four big-ticket space projects — Chandrayaan-4, NGLV, Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM), and the establishment of the first module of India’s own space station — it will be put up before the govt by Isro for final approval.","The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is all geared up for the establishment of the third launch pad at its spaceport in Sriharikota.

NEW DELHI: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ), which conducts ICSE and ISC board exams, is gearing up for sweeping reforms with introduction of robotics and artificial intelligence as subjects for students of Classes XI and XII from 2025-26.At elementary level, these subjects will be offered in an integrated approach, where computer science will also include AI and coding.Another notable introduction will be a holistic progress card, which will provide a 360-degree assessment of students' progress in achieving learning outcomes. The changes will include increasing competency-based questions for Board exams starting with 25% in 2025 to 50% in 2027, and curriculum revision based on NCERT's National Curriculum Framework, among others.The changes targeted at bringing CISCE's academic and administrative practices in line with National Education Policy 2020, will impact over 30 lakh school students across country. One of the key initiatives is introduction of three-stage non-retaining digital assessments for Classes III, V, and VIII, starting from 2025-26 academic session. Envisioned in NE, these assessments will serve as diagnostic tools for remediation and identifying gifted students.Joseph Emmanuel, CEO & secretary of CISCE, said, ""This approach, integrating humanities, arts, and STEM subjects, has shown positive outcomes, including increased creativity, innovation, critical thinking, & higher-order thinking capacities.""A major shift will be seen in assessment, with the initiation of competency-based education from 2025. In Board exams, 25% questions will be competency-based in 2025, increasing to 40% in 2026 and 50% in 2027. The aim is to test core competencies rather than memorised facts, making Classes X and XII Board exams ""easier"".CISCE will also roll out a school improvement plan from next year . Emmanuel further added, ""The larger vision is for high-performing schools to voluntarily work with state govts to improve quality of govt schools.""","The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE) is gearing up for sweeping reforms.

HIV prevention therapy likely to become cheaper but accessibility concerns remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-prevention-therapy-likely-to-become-cheaper-but-accessibility-concerns-remain/articleshow/114024882.cms,"US pharma giant Gilead Sciences' partnership with domestic companies to produce generic versions of its groundbreaking HIV prevention therapy, lenacapavir , is expected to make treatment significantly more affordable, with prices likely to drop to a fraction of those charged in the US. However, despite this potential for reduced costs, concerns persist regarding accessibility in high-incidence developing countries and those experiencing rising HIV infections.On Oct 2, Gilead announced it will allow generic manufacturers including Dr Reddy's, Emcure, Hetero and Mylan - to produce a generic version of the twice-yearly HIV injection in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries. The pathbreaking AIDS therapy which costs around $44,000 for twice-yearly injections in the US, has garnered attention for its potential in HIV prevention globally. ""Given the transformative potential of lenacapavir for prevention, our focus is on making it available as quickly and broadly as possible where the need is greatest,"" said Daniel O'Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead.The entry of generics is projected to drastically reduce prices in India from the exorbitant $40,000 per patient per year to around $200-300 within next couple of years, following necessary regulatory approvals. A study by Liverpool University estimated that prices for generic lenacapavir could initially fall to $100 per person per year and eventually reach $40 per person per year as production volumes increase. ""We are not able to comment on pricing at this point. However, the aim of this collaboration is to increase access so we will price it affordably,"" a Dr Reddy's spokesperson said.Patent and public health experts argue that voluntary license (VL) granted by Gilead is ""restrictive,"" limiting the ability of generics to significantly contribute to ending the decades-long HIV pandemic. ""The VL appears good on paper. However, it seeks to control production of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), key to production of affordable versions, while failing to fully utilise the capabilities of large API manufacturers like Natco, Lupin, Aurobindo and Laurus Labs. And for finished formulation - Lupin, Strides and Aurobindo. If overall supply of API is restricted, a reduction in the prices could take longer,"" Leena Menghaney, India Head of Medecins Sans Frontieres Access Campaign told TOI.A faster regulatory approval for patients here hinges on waiver of local clinical trials, she added.Gilead has filed patents widely on the drug, and the VL meant to overcome patent barriers will not make lenacapavir accessible in key countries, KM Gopa Kumar a senior researcher with Third World Network said.","US pharma giant Gilead Sciences' partnership with domestic companies to produce generic versions of its groundbreaking HIV prevention therapy, lenacapavir.

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's experience helped secure a six-wicket victory for India against Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup, keeping their semi-final hopes alive on Sunday. Chasing a modest target of 106 runs, India struggled but managed to clinch the win thanks to Harmanpreet's 24-ball 29-run innings. She retired hurt with two runs needed to win, and Sajana Sajeevan, on her debut, sealed the victory with a boundary.Opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) adopted a cautious approach, affecting India's Net Run Rate (NRR) negatively.India's current NRR stands at -1.217, below Pakistan's -0.555. To keep semi-final hopes alive, India must win against Australia and Sri Lanka by significant margins.The Indian innings included only five boundaries, and the top three batters struggled to accelerate. With Smriti Mandhana out early, Shafali and Jemimah focused on singles.The heat impacted the running between the wickets, with easy doubles and triples left unattempted. Shafali's fitness issues and Jemimah's reliance on timing over power added pressure on the batting unit.Harmanpreet took charge after the dismissal of Jemimah and Richa Ghosh off consecutive deliveries by Fatima.Earlier, Indian bowlers contained Pakistan to 105 for 8. Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) maintained discipline in their line and length. Off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) focused on varying their pace.Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) took the wicket of Pakistan skipper Fatima, thanks to a sharp catch by Richa Ghosh.India restricted Pakistan to 29 for 2 in the powerplay. Nida Dar's 28 runs provided some resistance but were insufficient to post a challenging total. Indian bowlers delivered 58 dot balls, reflecting their control over the game.India now needs to capitalize on this win and maintain momentum in their upcoming matches to advance to the semi-finals.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets to keep semi-final hopes alive.

At least three spectators who went to watch the Indian Air Force 's air show in Chennai died on Sunday after the event. They were admitted to hospitals due to dehydration and other issues, but doctors said that the actual cause of death can only be determined after postmortem test results are available.Though the air show on the sandy Marina Beach was a big draw, several thousand of people who converged on the idyllic shore found it extremely arduous to return home after the event.At least three persons took ill and died, police said.The Lighthouse metro station nearby and the Chennai MRTS railway station at Velachery, which serves as the closest junction connecting Chintadripet near the Marina, were swarmed by several hundreds of people and many found it difficult to even get a foothold to stand on the platform.The bus stop at Anna Square, in close proximity to the aerial display venue, overflowed with people. ""Nearly a dozen people swooned on the Marina due to a near stampede-like situation and also because of the hot weather, and they were treated at a government facility,"" a senior police official said.According to media reports, a 56-year-old man named John was brought dead to Omandurar government hospital after attending the event in the afternoon.Omandurar Hospital dean Arvind said that the exact reason for the death, whether it was due to the heat, can only be determined after the post-mortem report is available. Around 30 people were admitted to the hospital in the evening following the air force show due to the impact of the heat.Most of them were discharged and sent back to their homes.Several other hospitals also reported numerous dehydration cases.Massive crowd had gathered at Marina Beach to witness the aerobatics but faced severe difficulties after the event concluded at 1 pm.The spectators attempted to exit simultaneously, resulting in chaos on roads and at metro and suburban stations. Trains at railway stations were overcrowded, with passengers crammed up to the gates of the boggies.Traffic near the Marina beach was restored nearly three hours after the air show by IAF aircraft concluded at 1 pm, a police official said.",At least three spectators who went to watch the Indian Air Force's air show in Chennai died on Sunday after the event.

Sanjay Roy raped and murdered RG Kar doctor: CBI chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-roy-raped-and-murdered-rg-kar-doctor-cbi-chargesheet/articleshow/114023967.cms,"Accused Sanjay Roy (File photo)

KOLKATA: CBI on Monday filed a 45-page chargesheet, naming Kolkata Police volunteer Sanjay Roy as the sole accused in the Aug 9 rape-murder of a doctor inside RG Kar hospital. Cops had arrested Roy within 24 hours of the crime.CBI's first chargesheet in the case, submitted in a special court, requests Roy's trial in custody and leaves room for a supplementary chargesheet.Sources said Roy has been charged under BNS Sections 64(1) (punishment for rape), 66 (causing injury leading to death or vegetative state), and 103(1) (punishment for murder) - the latter two being punishable by death.Sanjay Roy, who is currently in solitary confinement at Presidency Correctional Home in Kolkata, is expected to appear in court on Oct 18.According to sources, CBI officers cited a total of 128 witnesses, with 51 tied directly to the rape-murder, and the rest related to charges of evidence-tampering and conspiracy. No one else has been formally charged in the document, though the agency is continuing to investigate possible complicity by others, including RG Kar college’s ex-principal Sandip Ghosh and Tala police station’s former officer-in-charge Abhijit Mandal. CBI arrested them on Sept 15.CBI’s chargesheet was filed on the third day of the fast-unto-death protest by West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front , seeking a faster probe among other demands. “This is progress, but it’s been slow. We believe more people are involved,” said a junior doctor. Senior doctors questioned evidence-tampering efforts and expect the supplementary chargesheet to reveal more culprits.The victim’s father expressed faith in the legal process: “We don’t know about chargesheet, so I can’t comment on it. But we trust the law andCBI investigation.”Earlier, her parents had planned a five-day sit-in outside their home during Durga Puja but clarified Monday they would not be holding a formal protest. “My daughter used to organise the Durga Puja pandal at our house. This year, there will be no puja. Instead, we’ve asked for a stage to meet people during the puja days,” said the father.The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) on Monday announced a nationwide hunger strike from Wednesday, which will be two months from the day the alleged rape-murder of a trainee doctor happened.","CBI's first chargesheet in the case, submitted in a special court, requests Roy's trial in custody.

J&K and Haryana assembly election result 2024: Congress eyes comeback in Haryana; BJP banks on 'Naya Kashmir',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-result-2024-haryana-jammu-kashmir-vidhan-sabha-assembly-election-results-bjp-congress-vote-counting-date-time/articleshow/114020810.cms,"J&K and Haryana Assembly election result 2024

Check Result

High-stakes J&K election: Congress-NC, PDP, BJP in pitched battle

Three-tier security in place for J&K vote counting

Top political leaders in J&K race

Two-way fight in Haryana

First major BJP vs Congress faceoff since LS polls

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the results of the 2024 assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir, which will mark the first major electoral outcome following the recent Lok Sabha elections. The counting of votes will begin at 8am on October 8. The postal ballots will be counted first, followed by electronic voting machine (EVM) votes.As political parties await the outcome with bated breath, all eyes will be on the pollsters whose exit poll predictions would be tested with the actual results.The results are likely to reflect broader political sentiments as parties gear up for upcoming electoral battles in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi.Election to the 90-seat J&K assembly is particularly historic as it is the first since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which altered the region's political landscape significantly.Exit polls indicate a competitive race between the Congress-National Conference (NC) alliance and the BJP, with predictions suggesting that the alliance may secure around 43 seats, still 3 seats short of a majority of 46.The BJP, on the other hand, is expected to win 27 seats, while the PDP and other parties are predicted to win 7 and 13 seats, respectively.The BJP's performance will be closely scrutinised as it seeks to establish itself further in the region after previously forming a coalition government with the People's Democratic Party (PDP)The first assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir since 2014 was conducted in three phases, with 24 seats voting in the first phase, 26 in the second, and 40 in the third. The fate of 873 candidates, competing for a seat in the 90-member house, has been sealed and will be revealed by Tuesday evening. The turnout was 63.45%, slightly lower than the 65.52% recorded in the 2014 assembly elections.As political parties evaluated their prospects, the administration was occupied with finalising arrangements, including security measures, at designated centres across all 20 district headquarters.Election commission officials have said that a three-tier security arrangement has been established at all counting centres to ensure smooth proceedings in the restive border union territory, which has long been a point of tension and has witnessed repeated instances of terrorism, insurgency, and infiltration from across the border.Prominent candidates in the fray include NC leader Omar Abdullah, Sajad Gani Lone of People's Conference, Pradesh Congress Committee president Tariq Hamid Karra, and BJP state president Ravindra Raina.Other notable contestants are AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir, PDP leaders Waheed Para and Iltija Mufti, Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari, CPI(M) veteran Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, and former deputy chief ministers Muzaffar Hussain Baig and Tara Chand.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is aiming for a third consecutive term despite facing anti-incumbency sentiments in Haryana. Meanwhile, the Congress, buoyed by exit polls suggesting a potential comeback, is eager to reclaim power after a decade in opposition.Other regional players like the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) could play spoiler roles in this tightly contested election.Chief electoral officer, Pankaj Agarwal, has confirmed that all necessary preparations, including security arrangements, have been made for the counting process, which is set to begin at 8am.Polling in Haryana was held on October 5. The electorate, consisting of more than 2 crore registered voters, cast their ballots across all 90 constituencies in the state. Initially, the polls were planned to take place on October 1, but the election commission later decided to postpone the date to October 5.The elections witnessed a voter turnout of 67.9%.The Haryana elections saw the first major direct contest between the BJP and the Congress since the Lok Sabha polls, and the outcome will be used by the winning party to build a narrative in their favour for upcoming polls in other states.Jammu and Kashmir also held elections alongside Haryana, but most seats there have seen multi-corner contests rather than a direct Congress-BJP fight.According to exit polls, the Congress is set to make a triumphant return to power in Haryana after a decade-long hiatus.The party is projected to secure approximately 55 seats -- comfortably crossing the 46-seat majority mark -- while the BJP is expected to win around 27 seats. The INLD is predicted to win 2 seats, the JJP 1 seat, and others around 5 seats.",The results of the 2024 assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir will be announced on October 8. It will be the first major electoral outcome following the recent Lok Sabha elections. Election to the 90-seat J&K assembly is particularly historic as it is the first since the abrogation of Article 370.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114020834,imgsize-3843644,width-400,resizemode-4/114020834.jpg"
Infamous 'bride bazaar' of Hyderabad moves online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infamous-bride-bazaar-of-hyderabad-moves-online/articleshow/114023971.cms,"TOI

TOI

HYDERABAD: Fatima (name changed) is decked up for her wedding day. An embellished kameez under the burqa and a bold lip, modestly hidden behind the veil. But her cheeks are washed out. There's no new-bride twinkle in her eyes.This marriage, after all, isn't one for the albums. She signed up for it only to get her ailing grandmother out of hospital and put her younger sister through school.The 22-year-old's prospective groom - close to three times her age - has promised Rs 2 lakh for this nikah and for her to be sent to him in Oman.Fatima is just another bride from the bazaars of Hyderabad's Old City that continue to flourish and cater to rich Arab clients , albeit stealthily. These ""transactions"" have now resurfaced online.Instead of shady halls and hotels, these marriages are now performed on WhatsApp, with many claiming “business” is better than ever. Famously chronicled in ‘Bazaar’, the 1982 film starring Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah and Farooq Shaikh, this decades-old “trade” of young girls being wedded to aged men with deep pockets — often for just a few weeks — had slowed down post a series of crackdowns in 2018. Many even assumed it had died out. But, as Fatima’s tale and those others suggest, they were mistaken.Fatima’s wedding venue was right in the middle of the road. “They asked me to go to Mysuru with them to complete the nikah… I got scared and refused,” the stoic Fatima told, stepping out of an autorickshaw that had pulled up on the side of a crowded Chadrayangutta market where she’d been dropped off an hour ago. “They” here are agents — two burly men in an SUV — who had set up Fatima’s video-conference-nikah inside the car. The agents’ fee: Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.Now, with the deal called off, the young woman must wait for her next proposal.“At least 20 to 30 such weddings are happening every month,” said Hussain (name changed), who has been brokering such marriages for years now. “If not me, someone else will do it… there’s tremendous demand,” he nonchalantly puts it, showing off his phone gallery that has at least half a dozen photos and videos of young girls “shortlisted” for these nikahs. The girls are between 18 and 25 years old.There’s a folder for grooms as well. Visibly wealthy Arab men looking for their next bride. And while many of them appear well past their 50s, their ID cards claim they aren’t a day older than 35, or 39 at best. Almost all are businessmen from Oman, Bahrain, Qatar etc.“Unlike earlier when they travelled to Hyderabad to physically choose their bride, the entire process is online these days. The men are sent photographs of the girls and once they make their selection, agents on both sides strike a deal. Then a date is fixed, a qazi is taken on a video call — most of them are from Hyderabad or Mumbai — and the nikah is completed,” Hussain explained.He was speaking in between answering a call from an agent in Oman who said that her client wasn’t happy with the photos of prospective brides sent to him.listened in to the conversation: “…mere paas aur aisi bacchiyan hain… main bhejti hoon (I have more girls like this… I will send their photos),” the agent is heard saying, relaying to Hussain what she had told her client.Audio recordings and conversations with more young girls and their agents revealed that after these weddings, these women are sent to their husbands on tourist visas. What happens to them next is tough to hazard a guess on.“I had to run away from the house because I realised the man was too old and he had taken me there to keep me as a domestic help. I also got only Rs 5,000 as opposed to Rs 2 lakh promised initially. The rest was siphoned off by the agents, including a lady in Oman who hosted us initially,” said Suhana*, another 20 something from the city who had to plead with her family back home to borrow some money to help her return.“It’s very tough to trap the culprits because the entire process is online. Brokers, visa agents must be closely monitored and local public representatives must be involved to arrest this activity,” a senior Telangana police officer said.","The decades-old 'trade' of young girls being wedded to aged men with deep pockets has resurfaced online.

PM Modi accepts Muizzu invite to visit Maldives next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-accepts-muizzu-invite-to-visit-maldives-next-year/articleshow/114023922.cms,"NEW DELHI: As PM Narendra Modi and Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu sought to boost ties in a bilateral meeting, India announced support in the form of $400 million and Rs 3,000 crore as a bilateral currency swap agreement which, Muizzu acknowledged, will be instrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by his country.Looking to strengthen strategic ties, including through increased defence cooperation , Modi and Muizzu agreed to comprehensively transform the bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership.While underlining India’s traditional support to the Maldives as the first responder, Modi announced the two sides will initiate discussions for a Free Trade Agreement.“Today, as per the need of Maldives, a currency swap agreement of USD 400 million and INR 3000 crore (INR 30 billion) has also been concluded,” said Modi, adding Muizzu’s visit marked a “new chapter” in ties. The Maldivian President also invited Modi to visit the island nation next year when the two countries celebrate the 60th anniversary of establishment of bilateral ties . “PM Modi accepted President Muizzu's invitation to visit Maldives next year.” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.The two sides signed five MoUs and made several announcements, including the inauguration of the new runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport and another for refit of a Maldivian Coast Guard ship.Muizzu said India is a key partner in the socioeconomic and infrastructure development of the Maldives, and has stood by the Maldives during its times of need.“I am thankful for the Indian govt’s decision to provide support in the form of INR 30 billion, in addition to $ 400 million bilateral currency swap agreement, which will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now. Our discussions today underscored a shared commitment to remain engaged on further measures that will bolster the Maldives’ economic resilience and stability,” he said, adding the Maldives will remain a true friend, committed to the shared vision of peace and development in the region.Modi said he engaged in comprehensive discussions on various aspects of defence and security cooperation. “We will continue our cooperation in training and capacity building of the Maldives National Defence Forces. Together, we will strive for stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean Region.We will enhance our cooperation in hydrography and disaster response,” he said.“India has consistently acted as the first responder for the Maldives. Be it essential commodities for the people of the Maldives, providing drinking water during natural disasters, delivering vaccines during the COVID pandemic, India has consistently upheld its responsibilities as a neighbour,” he added. “In future, we will work to connect India and the Maldives through UPI as well,” Modi said.The bilateral ties took a hit when Maldivian ministers made critical remarks about Modi last year. However, Muizzu has since toned down his anti-India stance and even sacked ministers who were critical of Modi. ""Yaarana jaari rahega (friendly ties will continue),"" Misri said when asked how India managed to bridge the sharp divide in the bilateral ties that had emerged.India extended emergency financial support to the Maldives last month by subscribing to its $50 million treasury bill at the request of Muizzu's govt, days after China agreed to strengthen trade and investment in the Indian Ocean nation.“Development partnership is a key pillar of our relationship.And we always give preference to the priorities of Maldivian people in this context,” said Modi, adding India is Maldives closest neighbour and a steadfast friend. He said India will continue to provide all possible support for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives.","India announced support in the form of $400 million and Rs 3,000 crore as a bilateral currency swap agreement.

"3 freezing nights, no tent: Climbers 'lucky to be alive'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-freezing-nights-no-tent-climbers-lucky-to-be-alive/articleshow/114023972.cms,"DEHRADUN: A day after she was rescued from the Garhwal Himalayas along with fellow climber Michelle Theresa Dvorak, British alpinist Fay Jane Manners recounted the harrowing experience that left them stranded for four nights at 20,997 feet (6,400m), reports Gaurav Talwar. Fay and Michelle were trying to summit the unclimbed southeast buttress of the Chaukhamba-III peak when they lost their gear and essential supplies, leaving them vulnerable to freezing temperatures.Manners, 37, told a London newspaper: ""We would have either frozen to death or attempted to cross the steep glaciers without the right equipment and slipped to our peril."" She and Michelle, 31, lost almost all their equipment, food and water in a rockfall on Wednesday as they tried to become the first team to summit the 6,995-metre peak. They were stranded in temperatures as low as minus 15°C, surviving for three nights with nothing but a sleeping bag.The pair had been climbing for five days when the rockfall severed a rope they were using to haul a rucksack behind them. In a social media post, Fay said, “I watched the bag tumble down the mountain and I immediately knew the consequence of what was to come.” The loss of gear forced them to abandon their summit attempt and battle the extreme conditions for survival.“Losing the bag devastated us, knowing we had to deal with this crisis in an exhausted state,” she added. Without their tent, stove and crampons, they were left exposed to freezing conditions and at risk of hypothermia.Reflecting on the critical moment, Fay said: “Nothing can describe the sinking feeling when we saw our bag with essential supplies tumble down the mountain.” Without proper equipment, they faced the danger of freezing or starving. That night, they found a small ledge to shelter on and crawled into a double sleeping bag they luckily still had. “I was freezing; my down trousers, thicker socks, and all the warmer clothes I had in my bag for the evenings were no longer accessible,” Fay told Telegraph (London).The climbers had set off from their base camp on the Satopanth Glacier on Sept 27 to attempt the unclimbed route but faced increasingly hazardous conditions.Despite sending out an SOS, the pair felt hopeless when a rescue helicopter flew by twice without spotting them. “I felt hypothermic, constantly shaking, and with the lack of food, my body was running out of energy to keep warm,” Fay was quoted by the UK paper as saying. By Saturday, they had barely survived another night. “We were destroyed and we were losing faith,” she admitted. It was only after a team of three French mountaineers, who were in the area for their own summit attempt, spotted them that their ordeal came to an end. “It was a small miracle,” Fay said. “As we were abseiling down on Saturday, we could see a team of climbers coming up the mountain towards us.”The French climbers provided the much-needed support, helping Fay and Michelle cross the steep glacier and giving them food and water. “They gave us their tent and sleeping bags and finally told the helicopter where to come and collect us,” Fay said. In fact, the French climbers abandoned their ascent to the peak to help the stranded duo.On Sunday, an Indian Air Force helicopter landed at 5,300 metres above sea level on the Panpatia Bank Glacier and airlifted the pair to safety in Joshimath. Col Madan Gurung, who coordinated the rescue operation for the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, said that the women were “exhausted” but otherwise “perfectly fine”.","British alpinist Fay Jane Manners recounted the harrowing experience that left them stranded for four nights at 20,997 feet (6,400m) Fay and Michelle were trying to summit the unclimbed southeast buttress of the Chaukhamba-III peak when they lost their gear and essential supplies, leaving them vulnerable to freezing temperatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114024065,imgsize-83304,width-400,resizemode-4/114024065.jpg"

They insult the basic principles of Hinduism and damage idols. Hindus do not react to any of this. But if an ignorant person makes a remark, then there are malign attempts to create chaos. No one should dare to take the law into their hands. If that happens then they have to face legal action...""Meanwhile, BJP MLA Shalabh Mani Tripathi threatened protestors that they would get a “taste of Israel” if they tried raising frenzied slogans in UP. “Here, treatment will be given through the constitution of Babasaheb and not the Sharia, and that too a proper one… don’t cry then,” said Tripathi on October 6 in a post on X.The chief minister made these comments during a review of the law and order situation with top officials, emphasizing that ""anarchy, vandalism or arson in the name of protest is not acceptable"" and those who dare to engage in such activities will have to face the consequences.Following Dasna temple priest Yati Narsinghanand's remarks against Prophet Muhammad, several Muslim organisations and political party leaders called for the priest's arrest and strict action against him. Two FIRs have been lodged against Narsinghanand and his disciples for their objectionable remarks.Meanwhile, CM Adityanath directed the police administration to ensure that upcoming festivals are celebrated with joy and harmony, and to identify and take strict action against those who attempt to spoil the atmosphere or work against the law. He further instructed the police to intensify foot patrolling and police response vehicles in crowded areas to ensure women's safety and convenience.","Yogi Adityanath said derogatory remarks against deities, great men, or saints of any religion or sect will not be tolerated.

NEW DELHI: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Monday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the government's decision to provide financial assistance of Rs 30 billion ($360 million), in addition to a $400 million bilateral currency swap agreement .""I am thankful for the Indian Government's decision to provide support in the form of Rs 30 billion in addition to $400 million bilateral currency swap agreement which will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now,"" Muizzu said, ANI reported.The agreements were signed during the bilateral and delegation-level talks held at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.Prime Minister Modi described the ""development partnership"" as a key pillar in the relations between India and the Maldives, stating that India has always prioritised the needs of the Maldivian people.Furthermore, PM Modi and President Muizzu witnessed the first transaction of RuPay card payments launched in the Maldives, and virtually inaugurated the runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport.The runway was developed with a concessional line of credit funding from India.PM Modi in a joint press statement along with President Muizzu said that India and the Maldives will be connected through UPI in the future, adding that, ""A few days back, RuPay card was launched in Maldives. In the time to come, India and Maldives will be connected through UPI.""In September, India announced that the State Bank of India would subscribe to $50 million worth of Maldivian government bonds. Earlier, in May 2024, SBI had similarly subscribed to $50 million in T-bills under the same mechanism, following a request from the Government of Maldives.President Muizzu, who is on a five-day visit to India, was accorded a ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.This marks Muizzu's second visit to India this year, following his attendance at Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June.Elaborating on the Indian government's decision to provide financial assistance to Maldives' struggling economy, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""In so far as the currency swap agreement is concerned, this is an agreement that has two elements to it. There is the element to allow Maldives to avail a $400 million window and a separate Rs 30 billion window under this. The idea is essentially to bolster Maldives' foreign exchange reserves, and that they have access to these reserves.""Misri added that India will also undertake the repairs and refit of the Maldives Coast Guard ship Huravee which is a patrol vessel that had been gifted to Maldives by the government of India a few years ago.The Maldives Anti-Corruption Commission and the Central Bureau of Investigation of India have also inked an MoU on cooperation in preventing and combating corruption.","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Monday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the government's decision to provide financial assistance.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday reacted to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat 's call for 'Hindus to unite for their security,' alleging that it is Prime Minister Modi and his ideological mentor who pose a real danger to Hindus, Muslims, and others in the country.However, shortly after his remark, Union minister Giriraj Singh came to the defence of the RSS chief and PM Modi, accusing the Hyderabad MP of harboring ""anti-India sentiments in his DNA"".Earlier on Saturday, the RSS chief addressing Swayamsevaks (volunteers) had affirmed that India is a "" Hindu nation "". ""We have resided here since time immemorial, even though the appellation Hindu emerged later"". Further, the RSS chief pitched that the Hindu society must unite for its security by eradicating language, caste, and regional differences.Miffed at the RSS chief's remark, the AIMIM supremo reacted by asserting that neither Hindus or Muslims face any danger in the country. ""The danger to Muslims, Hindus, Dalits, Adivasis, Sikhs, Christians is from Narendra Modi and Mohan Bhagwat,"" he said addressing a public meeting at Nizamabad in Telangana.Alleging that PM Modi has troubled Hindus, Muslims and others during his rule, the AIMIM president said that the Prime Minister talks about demographic changes in Jharkhand though the country faces problems like rampant unemployment.Further, reffering to the raging war in West Asia, Owaisi also urged PM Modi to prevail upon his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and work for a ceasefire.""I urge our Prime Minister Modi ji, explain to Benjamin Netanyahu, push for a ceasefire (in West Asia). Though 12-15 lakh Palestinians have lost their homes, I have seen their courage, they are not afraid of death,"" he said.However, his remarks did not go unnoticed in the BJP, with Union minister Giriraj Singh slamming the five time Hyderabad MP for, what he termed ""harboring anti-India sentiments in his DNA."" The Begusarai MP hit back at Owaisi, saying, ""Mohan Bhagwat has not said anything wrong. The real danger to India comes from people like Owaisi and his thinking. Anti-India sentiments are embedded in Owaisi's DNA.""Defending RSS chief's call for for "" Hindu unity "", he said, ""The current situation demands that all Sanatanis in India come together.

IAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-quietly-shooting-down-chinese-spy-balloons-at-high-altitudes/articleshow/113993660.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IAF has quietly been practising shooting targets mimicking Chinese spy balloons at very high-altitudes, with the latest instance being of an omni-role Rafale fighter jet using an air-to-air missile to bring down such a target in the eastern sector a few months ago.The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023 before it was finally shot down by an American F-22 Raptor using an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.The US had shared information with India and other countries about the incident.""The IAF formulated TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) to handle such contingencies. It has been practising the capability to interject in such situations at different flight envelopes,"" a source told TOI.""Rafale's demonstration was at an altitude of over 55,000 feet, way over what had been practised earlier. The target balloon, with a payload, was relatively smaller than the Chinese one that violated US airspace,"" he added.The fifth-generation F-22 flying at an altitude of 58,000 feet, had launched the missile to hit the balloon at an altitude of well over 60,000 feet on Feb 4 last year.The IAF's 4.5-generation Rafale, which are armed with the 120-150-km range 'Meteor' and 70-km MICA air-to-air missiles among other weapons, in turn, went after the target that was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet.Chinese spy balloons, which are akin to huge unmanned airships and capable of sending ""burst transmissions"", are difficult to detect and intercept since they have low radar cross-sections and fly at very high altitudes.In early-2022, a high-altitude balloon-like object was spotted over the strategically located Andaman and Nicobar islands but nothing much could be done because India as yet does not deploy fighters on the archipelago on a permanent basis, though IAF fighters do operate from the islands on short-term detachments for exercises.China, of course, also regularly deploys its 'spy' vessels in the Bay of Bengal and southern India Ocean to track India's ballistic missile launches as well as map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.The IAF has based its 36 Rafales at the Hasimara and Ambala airbases. Hasimara is close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction and the strategically-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor on the eastern front with China.",The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023.

At present, AB-PMJAY has around 25 health packages catering to needs of the elderly.Govt sources said the National Health Authority , which is the implementing agency for AB-PMJAY, is working towards adding more packages that exclusively tend to geriatric care or old-age related ailments as the number of such beneficiaries is likely to go up significantly, with the govt expanding the scheme to include senior citizens, aged 70 and above, irrespective of their income group.""A committee headed by medical experts reviews health packages under AB-PMJAY regularly.

The committee will work towards identifying health issues affecting the seniors, especially those requiring hospitalisation, and try to develop packages so that they can get timely treatment,"" a source in the health ministry said.The expansion of AB-PMJAY to include senior citizens will potentially benefit around six crore individuals across 4.5 crore families.Stroke, heart failure, cancer, Alzheimer's and dementia are some of the common health ailments affecting the elderly. The health ministry official said treatment of these ailments and complications thereof are likely to be addressed in special packages being planned for the elderly.Dr Prasun Chatterjee, additional medical superintendent at the National Centre for Ageing, told TOI that conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia are fairly common among the elderly and they are also linked to increase risk of infections necessitating hospitalisation.

Although exit polls showed BJP was headed for the exit, CM Nayab Singh Saini dismissed the findings. The elections mark the first big battle between BJP and Congress since the Lok Sabha polls. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asserted that his party would win in both Haryana and J&K.

""The people have voted for us, endorsing our vision for development and peace,"" he said, while predicting a ""crushing"" defeat for Congress. It will be interesting to see if BJP will try to get a Hindu appointed as chief minister in case Raina's assertion is proven correct: a prospect which can help them compensate substantially for the loss of Haryana and sharpen the Hindutva plank.As parties positioned themselves, security was tightened at counting centres across J&K, where voter turnout was 63%, slightly lower than the 65% in 2014.In Haryana, more than 1,000 candidates, including 101 women and 464 independents, contested in the single-phase elections to 90 constituencies, which saw a voter turnout of 68% on Oct 5.","Tuesday is a significant day for Haryana and J&K as votes are counted.

Jammu and Kashmir air thick with 'conspiracies' & controversies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-air-thick-with-conspiracies-controversies/articleshow/114024375.cms,"SRINAGAR: A fraught place even in the simpler of times, Jammu and Kashmir was a picture of keen anticipation on the eve of the election results, rife with rumours and agog with controversies that could determine the reaction of the people and the parties to the outcome.In the polls held after a gap long of 10 years and against the backdrop of the annulment of the special status for J&K under Art 370 and 35A, the question was if National Conference and Congress would get the numbers to form govt or fall short, triggering a mad scramble for alliances.But the bigger suspense seen with much trepidation in the Valley was if Jammu would give BJP enough seats to try forming govt with the famous ""X factors"" of this suspenseful contest - Apni Party, Engineer Rashid's AIP and independents.Ahead of the poll outcome, J&K was rocked by the controversy over ""five nominated MLAs"" that Centre said would be named by the LG. The opposition mocked that counting had already started for BJP and it would start its tally with five. There was talk of moving court if nominations were made by the LG instead of the future state cabinet ""as it should be"".State Congress president Tariq Hamid Karra called it ""pre-result rigging"", arguing that even the president cannot nominate members arbitrarily. PDP's Iltija Mufti said, ""1987's stolen election took J&K to the brink. Yet no lessons were learnt.""The protests were heard across regional faultlines, even as senior BJP neta and Bijbehara candidate Sofi Yousuf, named the five BJP members who would be nominated as MLAs. ""We are governing at the Centre, and obviously our members will be nominated,"" he said, fanning the flames. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal warned of a ""clear danger to the people's mandate"", adding, ""we are vigilant to all their dirty tricks and will not let them hijack our democracy. The misuse of Centre's powers will not be tolerated.""It was only partly comic that parties a day before the result were wondering if the majority mark in the assembly of 90 MLAs was 46 or 48. It was cricket and football at the same time, as some called it a ""free hit"" for BJP before the first ball had been bowled, and others dubbed it the ""shifting of the goalpost"".As if one row was not enough, the real X-factor Engineer Rashid stirred the pot further by demanding that regional parties refrain from forming govt till statehood is restored.NC and Congress accused Engineer of playing the BJP's game after visiting Delhi for a day. ""BJP would like nothing more than to extend the central rule in J&K, if they aren't in a position to form govt,"" Omar Abdullah said. Karra argued ""elections are fought to form govt and that obligation has to be fulfilled.""Amid the flux, there was confusion about the formation of a grand alliance to keep BJP at bay. PDP's Nayeem Akhtar offered support to NC and Farooq Abdullah reciprocated with gratitude. But Omar Abdullah and PDP's Iltija rubbished the talk as ""unnecessary speculation"".Mandate 2024 raised the guessing game if the divide between Jammu and Kashmir regions will continue. For all the hostility in Kashmir, there is already a talk about BJP eyeing its first seat in Kashmir, with Gurez seen as a real possibility.It remains to be seen how the ""X-factors"" of Kashmir will roll after the results, and if BJP will actually find proxies in the Valley. Most of the Valley players have sought votes solely in the name of confronting BJP. And the funny bit is that every player - NC, PDP, People's Conference, Engineer - targeted the other as BJP's ""sleeper cell"" as they jostled for secular votes riled by 370 and Hindutva. In this play, PDP was at a serious loss because of its 2014 tie-up with BJP. That has made the election an issue of survival for the Mufti outfit.","J&K was rocked by the controversy over ""five nominated MLAs"" that Centre said would be named by LG.
