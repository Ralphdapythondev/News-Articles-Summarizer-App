"For 20 years, Thar getting more rain than normal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-20-years-thar-getting-more-rain-than-normal/articleshow/114199152.cms,"‘With warming climate, Rajasthan to get more rains’

NEW DELHI: West Rajasthan , land of Thar desert and the driest region in India's plains , was among two subdivisions out of 36 that received excess rainfall during this monsoon. Surprisingly, this was hardly an unusual monsoon for west Rajasthan, which has been getting higher-than-normal rainfall for at least the past two decades in an indication of shifting monsoon patterns in a warming world.As per IMD data analysed by TOI, west Rajasthan has got above-normal or excess monsoons for six years in a row. In last 20 years, June-Sept rain there has been excess/above normal in 12 years, normal in five and deficient in three. On average, monsoon has been 19% above normal during 2005-2024. Just how exceptional this kind of rain is in region can be gauged through a comparison with two contiguous subdivisions, Punjab and Haryana, during this period.Just how exceptional this kind of rainfall is in the region can be gauged through a comparison with two contiguous subdivisions, Punjab and Haryana, during this period. Punjab registered just one above-normal year, 12 normal years and seven years when monsoon was deficient, that is, 20% or more below normal. On average, the June-Sept rainfall was 13.5% below normal in the state during 2005-2024.Haryana’s monsoon pattern resembles that of Punjab. Since 2005, it has seen three above-normal years, eight years of normal rainfall and as many years of deficient rains. In addition, monsoon was ‘large deficient’ (or scanty) in one year. On average, monsoon has been 13.3% below normal in these 20 years.Even in India as a whole, monsoon during this period has on average been 1.5% less than normal.However, it must be noted that, being the driest subdivision (SD) in the country, the ‘normal’ rainfall figure for west Rajasthan is significantly lower than that of the other two SDs — 283.6mm at present as compared with 439.8-mm in Punjab and 430.7mm in Haryana.Yet, the divergence is significant and in several recent years west Rajasthan has received higher rainfall even in absolute terms than either Punjab or Haryana.“Rainfall over Rajasthan and Punjab-Haryana is decided by the position of the monsoon trough and the westward movement of low-pressure systems in the rainy season. During recent years, we have seen that the monsoon trough was positioned south of its normal position with more westward movement of low-pressure systems. In such situations, Rajasthan gets more rain and Punjab-Haryana less,” explained M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.Rajeevan said the region could be drawing rain-bearing clouds towards itself due to changes in soil moisture, land use patterns and, possibly, the addition of water bodies in recent decades, such as the Indira canal.“Local soil moisture feedback over Rajasthan also helps to tie-up the monsoon trough in that position and attract more low-pressure systems over that region. There is growing evidence of increasing soil moisture in Rajasthan and its interaction with monsoon,” he said.Finally, more rain over the Thar desert in recent years may just be a sign of things to come in an era of climate change. Said Rajeevan, “Future climate projections suggest Rajasthan and its desert will get more rain in a warming climate.”","West Rajasthan has got above-normal or excess monsoons for six years in a row.

Caste-based labour & limited food: Dalits recount jail horror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-based-labour-limited-food-dalits-recount-jail-horror/articleshow/114199002.cms,"Apex court verdict signals a long-awaited dawn of justice, says UP DGP

MEERUT/DEHRADUN: Daulat Kunwar has been imprisoned several times. Once behind bars, it was the same story each time for the Dalit activist. “Caste discrimination starts the moment an inmate steps into a prison, it is real and it has been going on for many years,” Kunwar told TOI in shocking revelations that were echoed by other prisoners, including undertrials, who spent time in the jails of UP and Uttarakhand.Now, though, Dalits in India’s jails see hope of better treatment following Supreme Court ’s landmark order on Oct 3 striking down a series of “colonial-era” rules mentioned in prison manuals across the country which “reinforced caste-based division of labour, particularly targeting marginalised communities”.Kunwar said, “Officials first enquire about a prisoner’s caste and note it down along with other personal details. The information about one’s caste will then be circulated in the entire jail and based on that an inmate will be assigned ‘work’. Dalits are mostly tasked with cleaning and sweeping. If anyone refuses, he is beaten up by other inmates on the directions of the jail administration.” It was worse for Hapur resident Inder Pal, 43. “I was jailed for 67 days. It felt like 67 years to me. I saw how inmates were forced to do low-grade labour they had never done in their lives. All of us were criminals. But some were considered superior. For two weeks, I was made to sweep. When I fell ill and couldn’t work, I was told to clean toilets. Without a brush. I was asked to use a cloth or my bare hands.”The inequality went beyond work. Monu Kashyap, 23, who spent seven days in a UP jail for possessing an illegal weapon, said, “Food was limited for prisoners belonging to the so-called lower castes, while others ate freely. Complaints were met with threats or beatings.” Ram Bahadur Singh, 38, also lodged in a UP jail, added that Dalit inmates were often told to form a separate queue for food.It is like feeding us with the leftovers... like animals,” he said.The recent apex court ruling has sparked optimism within police ranks, too. UP DGP Prashant Kumar, who hailed the decision, told TOI: “It’s a bold stride towards restoring the dignity of labour within Indian prisons. The verdict signals a long-awaited dawn of justice. For centuries, caste and occupation were wrongly fused, reducing entire communities to lives of subjugation and indignity.”UP’s top cop added, “With this ruling, anchored in Article 21, the court calls for an end to the chains of caste-driven labour in prisons, urging reforms that nurture equality.”Several social activists praised the ruling. Satish Prakash, a Dalit activist and associate professor at Meerut College, said changing jail manuals is only the beginning. “The real issue is the mindset. In a caste-ridden society, dominance persists both inside and outside the jail. Social engineering is must,” Prakash said. Kishore Kumar, an advocate and NCR-based Dalit activist, added, “For jail wardens, the term ‘Dalit’ is inseparable from what they call ‘hereditary trades’, such as manual scavenging, sweeping and cleaning...”However, some prison authorities TOI spoke to said “prejudice” wasn’t allowed in their jails. Dadhiram Maurya, DIG (prisons) in Uttarakhand, said, “There is no caste-based job assignment in our jails. It was stopped as per our new jail manual last Nov.”Additional district judge Shehzad Ali, secretary of the District Legal Services Authority, Bulandshahr, meanwhile, said the SC ruling will strengthen the hands of lawyers and activists to ensure compliance. “We’ve visited jails regularly to address complaints. Now, we’ll ensure strict compliance and take immediate action against violations,” Ali added.","Dalits in India’s jails see hope of better treatment following Supreme Court ’s landmark order on Oct 3 striking down a series of “colonial-era’ rules. “Caste discrimination starts the moment an inmate steps into a prison, it is real and it has been going on for many years,” says Dalit activist Daulat Kunwar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114199026,imgsize-219592,width-400,resizemode-4/114199026.jpg"

In all three cases, the emerging pattern is that relatively unknown shooters with no or limited criminal history were contracted by powerful, hidden players to execute high-profile murders with precision and lethal efficiency.Atiq and Ashraf were gunned down by three assailants - Lavlesh Tiwari (22), Mohit Singh alias Shani (23), and Arun Maurya (18) - at Colvin Hospital in Prayagraj on April 15, 2023. The brothers, facing trial for the 2005 murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal, were being escorted for a routine check-up when the , disguised as journalists, fired from close range. The shooting was executed in a swift manner, leaving Atiq and Ashraf dead on the spot. The assailants are in jail now.On June 7, 2023, Maheshwari - another gangster with 24 cases against him - was shot dead inside a Lucknow courtroom. The shooter, Vijay Yadav, posed as an advocate and fired six rounds at Maheshwari, killing him on the spot. In the crossfire, a toddler and her mother were also injured. Yadav, who had no known personal vendetta against Maheshwari, was arrested immediately, raising suspicion that he, too, was acting on behalf of a powerful figure. A striking similarity is the use of sophisticated, uncommon weapons. The killers of Atiq and Ashraf were armed with high-end 9mm Turkey Zigana pistols - expensive, imported firearms.","In all three cases, relatively unknown shooters with no or limited criminal history were contracted by powerful, hidden players.

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

It is believed that on this auspicious day, Maa Laxmi makes her earthly appearance and bestows health, money, and success upon her devotees. Hindus celebrate this as one of their auspicious festivals, during which they light diyas and give presents to their loved ones. Lighting lights is a symbol of virtue, innocence, and prosperity.","The festival of Diwali is going to be celebrated on Amavasya Tithi of Kartik Month i.e., on October 31, 2024. Laxmi Pujan is performed after sunset, when the Moon is visible in the sky so October 31 will be the ideal day to celebrate DiWali.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113723766,imgsize-41382,width-400,resizemode-4/113723766.jpg"

Precisely 80 days before allegedly assassinating NCP leader and three-time MLA Baba Siddique , one of the three accused,Shivkumar Gautam, had been flaunting his self-proclaimed 'Gangster' status on various social media platforms.Currently evading authorities, the accused hails from Gandara village in the Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh.DCP Mumbai Crime Branch Datta Nalawade announced on Sunday that the three accused, Gurmail Baljit Singh, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap, and Shivkumar Gautam , had conspired to initially incapacitate the victim with pepper spray before opening fire, but Shivkumar discharged his weapon prematurely.With 229 followers, and following 49 accounts, including union minister Chirag Paswan, PM Narendra Modi, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , the accused had made 33 posts, frequently depicting himself as a gangster.In one instance, he used a voice-over from the 2010 neo-noir crime thriller 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai', stating, ""…Yeh umar sudhar ne ke nahi, bigadne ki hain…muskil toh yeh hain ki mein abhi theek tarah se bigada bhi nahi."" (This is not the age to improve, but for getting spoiled... The problem is that I haven't even managed to get spoiled properly yet.)In another post, while capturing an urban landscape, he used a voice-over from KGF Chapter 2, which proclaims, ""Power people make places powerful"". In yet another post, he brazenly referred to himself as a villain, accompanied by a Bhojpuri song voice-over…"" Neta na kono vidhayak, majnu hamar khalnayak hai.""According to his mother Suman, ""Around April 2, 2024, Shivkumar had departed for Pune to work at a scrap yard; however, the accused's Instagram post from April 10 revealed that he was employed at a warehouse where he packed and shipped online orders.""","The three accused, Gurmail Baljit Singh, Dharmaraj Rajesh Kashyap, and Shivkumar Gautam had conspired to initially incapacitate the victim with pepper spray before opening fire.

Navy setting up base to control submarines on long-range patrols,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navy-sets-up-base-to-control-submarines-on-long-range-patrols/articleshow/114196990.cms,"Also read:

NEW DELHI: With India recently commissioning its second nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat as part of the plan to expand both the strategic as well as conventional underwater combat fleets, the Navy is now setting up a new advanced facility to seamlessly communicate with its stealthy predators out on long-range patrols.The project for the very low frequency (VLF) transmitting station at Vikarabad in Telangana is slated for inauguration by defence minister Rajnath Singh on October 15.“The strategically-important VLF facility, once it becomes fully operational in two-three years, will provide round-the-clock encrypted communication connectivity to submerged submarines across India’s entire area of interest,” a source told TOI.“VLF radio waves, which operate in a frequency band of 3 to 30 Kilohertz, can penetrate seawater to a certain depth for such purposes,” he added. Only a few nations have such VLF capabilities, which are especially critical for “command and control” of nuclear submarines deployed on long-range deterrent patrols.The Navy has been running a VLF station at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu since 1990. The new state-of-the-art VLF facility at Vikarabad is necessary for “maintaining 24x7x365 communication” for the planned induction of both diesel-electric as well as nuclear submarines, with an eye firmly on China’s increasing naval forays into the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).On Aug 29, India had inducted its second 6,000-tonne SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) INS Arighaat, which is also capable of carrying some 3,500-km range K-4 missiles. Her forerunner INS Arihant is armed only with the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India plans to induct the third SSBN, with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, as INS Aridhaman early next year, while a fourth is also under construction under the secretive advanced technology vessel (ATV) project. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors, as reported by TOI earlier.Moreover, the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9 also cleared the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore ' Project-77 ' to construct two nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs in naval parlance). It will take 10-12 years to build these SSNs, with 190 MW reactors and displacement of 9,800-tonne, meant for conventional (non-nuclear) warfare.On the diesel-electric front, the Navy will commission the sixth French-origin Scorpene submarine 'Vagsheer' in Dec under the over Rs 23,000 crore ' Project-75 ' underway at Mazagon Docks (MDL). While the Navy has six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, India is now finalising with France the construction of another three Scorpenes at MDL for over Rs 30,000 crore.Then, Germany and Spain are in contention for the long-pending over Rs 42,000 crore`Project-75-India’ to build six advanced diesel-electric submarines, with AIP (air-independent propulsion) for greater underwater endurance and land-attack cruise missiles.","The project for the very low frequency (VLF) transmitting station at Vikarabad in Telangana is slated for inauguration by defence minister Rajnath Singh on October 15.

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting.

Concern grows as Uttarakhand's 'skeleton lake' is shrinking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concern-grows-as-uttarakhands-skeleton-lake-is-shrinking/articleshow/114196899.cms,"DEHRADUN: Climate change is believed to be impacting one of Uttarakhand 's foremost trekking destinations, Roopkund Lake , situated 16,500ft above sea level at the base of Mt Trishul in the Garhwal Himalayas . Known as the ""lake of skeletons"", the glacial body conceals hundreds of human skeletons - some with preserved flesh - which become visible when the snow melts in the area.The lake caught the world's imagination after a forest official, HK Madhwal, stumbled upon the presence of human bones in its frozen waters in 1942.Since then, many theories have been propounded on the skeletons' origin. A 2019 study by scientists from India, the US and Germany debunked the popular theory that the skeletons were of a single group that died in one catastrophic event. Instead, it claimed the individuals were genetically diverse, and their deaths separated by as much as 1,000 years.What is now worrying forest officials, who have been deployed in that area for over two decades, is that the lake - spread over an area of around two acres and has a depth of around 9ft - is shrinking.Divisional forest officer (DFO) of Badrinath forest division in Chamoli, Sarvesh Dubey, said, ""The lake is shrinking in width and depth by about 0.1% to 0.5% annually. Traditionally, the area around Roopkund would experience snow flurries during rainfall, but now rain is more common, causing loose moraine to slide down into the lake. We believe this shift in precipitation pattern is directly linked to climate change and global warming, which is altering the natural balance of the region.""He added: ""We are reaching out to experts at Forest Research Institute and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) for solutions as this year saw excess rainfall and consequently, more silting.""Glaciologists also attributed the shift in precipitation patterns to climate change and global warming.Senior glaciologist at WIHG, Dehradun, Manish Mehta, said, ""According to the glacier inventory made by WIHG in 2013, we have around 1,200 lakes in the region. These are classified either as pro-glacial lakes, because they are located at the snout (front edge) of a glacier, or peri-glacial lakes, as they lie on the periphery (sides) of the glacier. Roopkund is a peri-glacial lake, and due to climate variations, the Himalayas are experiencing both decrease and increase in snow precipitation. In this case, it seems that reduced precipitation has led to the flow of unconsolidated loose moraine material into the lake, resulting in a reduction in both the lake's volume and its area.""Scientists believe that this phenomenon could lead to the greening of areas at high altitudes and also increased heat in the region.","Roopkund Lake is situated 16,500ft above sea level at the base of Mt Trishul in the Garhwal Himalayas.

Baba Siddique murder: One of the killers established links with Bishnoi gang in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baba-siddique-murder-one-of-the-killers-established-links-with-bishnoi-gang-in-jail/articleshow/114197578.cms,"MUMBAI: The motive for the murder of former MLA and Maharashtra minister Ziauddin 'Baba' Siddique remains unclear despite the arrest of two shooters, and an Akola resident who allegedly enlisted the shooters. One of the killers, Gurnail Singh , who has three cases in Haryana including one for murder, had allegedly established links with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in Kaithal jail there.He got bail 3-4 months ago and moved to Mumbai.Siddique was close to actor Salman Khan, who has been threatened and targeted on several occasions by jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his men due to his alleged involvement in the 1998 blackbuck killing case. Police are also looking at whether the murder was was a fallout of a dispute over a high-stakes slum rehabilitation (SRA) project in Bandra, in which Siddique was accused of irregularities. A social media post linking the killing to the Bishnoi gang had said the politician was targeted due to his links with Salman and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.Two of the shooters -Dharmaraj Kashyap who has been arrested, and Shivkumar Gautam, who is on the run - were neighbours in a village in Bahraich district in UP and had no criminal record. Singh and Kashyap are believed to have conducted a recce on Siddique's Bandra residence and his son's office at Nirmal Nagar before the attack. Police have seized two Glock automatic pistols and four magazines containing at least 28 bullets from the duo, suggesting strong back-up from their handlers.Bishnoi allegedly paid the three shooters Rs 50,000 upfront and promised Rs 2 lakh more to each of them after the killing. A police source said the accused were in the city since the first week of Sept. ""They stayed in a rented room in Kurla,"" said an officer. ""The accused had got money for their expenses, including the Rs 14,000 monthly rent.""Apart from the arms and ammo, one pistol magazine, four mobile phones, two Aadhaar cards and a bag were seized from the arrested accused. Kashyap and Singh have been booked for murder and attempted murder under the BNS as well as Arms Act. They were brought to Esplanade court on Sunday amid tight security. The court sent Singh in police custody till Oct 21, and asked cops to carry out an ossification test on Kashyap to determine his exact age after he claimed that he was 17 years old.When the magistrate asked for Kashyap's age-proof documents, public prosecutor Gautam Gaikwad referred to his seized Aadhaar card which said he was 21. But advocate Siddharth Agarwal, who appeared for both the accused, told the court that Kashyap was 17. Agarwal said his client was ready to undergo an ossification test.However, police are still investigating the motives, especially since Bishnoi delayed claiming responsibility for the murder on social media by more than 15 hours. This delay, along with the lack of adequate knowledge about the accused, has raised doubts about whether the gang link is a red herring. ""The two arrested accused have very little information. Our teams are trying to nab Gautam, who could reveal the details of the operation. We are also not ruling out the SRA angle, as the Bishnoi link could be a diversion,"" said a police official.Joint commissioner of police (law & order) Satyanarayan Choudhary confirmed that Siddique had not filed any complaints of a threat, rubbishing rumours that his security cover was recently enhanced to Y-plus. However, the fact that the assassins got past his police security has raised concerns. When asked about the security given to Siddique, a senior police officer said he had non-categorised security.""City crime branch's 15 teams are working on the case,"" said Datta Nalawade, DCP (Crime). Some police teams have been sent outside Maharashtra for a probe. When asked whether there was any SRA, business rivalry or involvement of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in the murder, Nalwade said, ""We are probing all angles.""When asked whether it was the handiwork of the Bishnoi gang, another police source said that they were inquiring into it. ""We want to be sure,' he said, adding, ""the arrested accused are portraying themselves as innocent and blaming the accused [Gautam] who fled from the spot"". Mumbai Police team conducted raids in Ujjain district and Omkareshwar town in Khandwa district of MP in connection with the murder. Ujjain SP Pradeep Sharma said, ""The team has been in Ujjain since Sunday morning and is working closely with the local crime branch. While Mumbai Police has not disclosed the specific connection of Ujjain to the case, their search efforts are focused on dharamshalas and religious sites due to the large influx of visitors from different regions.""","Ziauddin 'Baba' Siddique was close to actor Salman Khan, who has been threatened and targeted by jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.

Investigation began a decade ago when CBI first registered an FIR in Feb 2014.ED's probe revealed promoters of Pearl Group floated a ponzi scheme where they promised allotment of plots to investors. However, instead of delivering returns , the promoters siphoned off funds to shell entities registered in Kolkata. The money was then withdrawn in cash from these companies and sent to Dubai, using hawala channels. These funds were then invested in several countries to buy hotels and resorts.The money trail revealed a large investment was made in Australia in buying properties. In 2018, after successfully linking the 'proceeds of crime' to PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, ED attached two properties in Australia worth Rs 462 crore. Four years later, further Rs 244 crore worth of assets were attached in India linked to the group entities and associates of Bhangoo.The value of these assets, some held as financial instruments, may exceed over Rs 1,000 crore now.

The trustees include Kharge, his wife Radhabai, elder son and minister Priyank Kharge, son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and Rahul.""An educational institute cannot function effectively while facing mala fide, baseless, and politically motivated allegations... We do not wish to be drawn into controversies that will divert our attention and efforts from our primary objective of empowering the disempowered through education and social service,"" states the letter to the board.While the request for land had been approved, the site was still to be handed over to the trust, sources said.Defending his brother's decision, Priyank said BJP tried to create ""a needless controversy"" and the family decided to step back rather than make an issue of it. The Kharge family had been stoutly defending the land allotment until recently.""Rahul is a mild-mannered person who does not know how to counter these politically-motivated allegations, unlike us who are in public life. Siddhartha Vihar Trust is an educational, cultural, and charitable trust, and not a family or private entity,"" Priyank said, also taking a dig at Union home minister Amit Shah without naming him. ""The irony is that a person who cannot hold a bat can become the chairman of ICC or BCCI when BJP governs at the Centre, but a person (Rahul) who was conferred Agni Award by DRDO for excellence in self-reliance cannot build a skill development centre for the youth. So, he felt bad and decided to return the plot.""BJP MP Lahar Singh Siroya wrote on social media that he felt vindicated by the Kharge family's decision to return the land. ""When I raised this issue, I was threatened and abused by Kharge Jr and his cronies. Truth has prevailed,"" he said. The legislator suggested that since Siddaramaiah was on shaky ground, the return of land could even be a ploy to gain moral advantage. ""This may be a tactical move to seek the CM's chair,"" he saidBJP had called for a CBI investigation into the land allotment and petitioned the governor to dismiss Priyank from the state cabinet.When the controversy broke, CM Siddaramaiah had said, ""The allotment has been done in accordance with law. Their trust is eligible, so we have done it.""",Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's family-run trust Sunday withdrew an approved request for a five-acre site within Bengaluru's Aerospace Park.
