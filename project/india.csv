slams lateral entry move, says it undermines quotas

NEW DELHI: In the biggest such exercise since lateral entry began in 2019, Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) has invited applications for 45 mid-level posts of director, joint secretary and deputy secretary in various ministries and departments as govt seeks more specialists. So far, 63 appointments have been made through lateral entry at these levels during the past five years, and currently 57 such officers are posted, govt told RS on August 8.Applications have been invited for 10 joint secretary posts, which include two each in finance and MeitY (electronics and IT) ministries, and one each in environment, steel, shipping, science and technology, renewable energy and home ministry.Considering the need to go for people with specialisation, the MeitY has invited applications for joint secretary for 'emerging technologies' and another for 'semiconductor and electronics'.The two joint secretaries in the finance ministry will be hired for FinTech, cyber security and investment.According to the notification, the applications for the posts will have to be submitted by Sept 17 and will be on contract basis for three years, extendable to five years depending upon performance. The vacancies for joint secretaries in the shipping and environment ministries have been advertised as the term of two such officers hired earlier through lateral entry is ending.The fresh notification has triggered a strong protest from the opposition, which accused govt of systematically undermining the reservation system that safeguards opportunities for marginalised communities and their ""rightful"" share in governance.In a post in Hindi on X, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""BJP, which has ripped apart the Constitution, has made a double attack on reservation! Under a well-planned conspiracy, BJP is deliberately making such recruitments in jobs so that SC, ST, OBC classes can be kept away from reservation.""Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) neta Tejashwi Yadav slammed the move as a ""dirty joke"" on the reservation system and the Constitution drafted by B R Ambedkar. He said if these 45 posts were filled through the traditional civil services examination, nearly half of them would have been reserved for SC, ST, and OBC candidates.According to the UPSC notification, applications have been invited for 35 director and deputy secretary posts. These appointments will be for climate change and soil conservation, credit, natural farming, organic farming and water management in the agriculture ministry; commodity pricing in the consumer affairs department, insolvency and bankruptcy in the corporate affairs ministry, two in the education ministry to deal with education laws and technology to name a few.Applicants for the post of joint secretary need a minimum of 15 years of experience and must be in the age of 40-55 years. The gross salary will be approximately Rs 2.7 lakh per month. Similarly, director and deputy secretary candidates need a minimum of 10 and seven years of experience respectively. They must be in the age group of 35-45 years for director and 32-40 years for deputy secretaries.","UPSC has invited applications for 45 mid-level posts of director, joint secretary and deputy secretary in various ministries and departments.

US court: 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana can be extradited to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-court-26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-can-be-extradited-to-india/articleshow/112599310.cms,"US judge: Rana said people of India deserved 26/11 attack

A US court has ruled that Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Hussain Rana can be extradited to India, where is wanted for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said on Thursday.Ruling on an appeal filed by 63-year-old Rana, a panel of three judges affirmed the District Court in the Central District of California's denial of his habeas corpus petition challenging a magistrate judge's certification of him as ' extraditable ' to India.Rana, currently lodged in a jail in Los Angeles, faces charges for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai attack and is known to be associated with Pakistani-American LeT terrorist David Coleman Headley, one of the main conspirators of the attacks.Writing the opinion for the bench that ruled that Tahawwur Hussain Rana can be extradited to India, judge Milan Smith said ""India provided sufficient competent evidence"" to support the initial order of a magistrate judge's ""finding of probable cause that Rana committed the charged crimes"" to allow the extradition.Rana, a Canadian citizen living in Chicago, was arrested in the US in 2009 for plotting to bomb a Danish newspaper, 'Jyllands-Posten', that published a controversial image of Prophet Mohammed.He faced three main charges in a Chicago federal court relating to his involvement in the Danish case, providing support to Lashkar, and conspiring for the Mumbai attacks.He was acquitted of the Mumbai attack charge, but convicted in the other two and sentenced to 14 years.The appeals court ruled that his acquittal in the Mumbai attack charge did not affect his extradition because in India he faces several different charges, including conspiracy, waging war, murder, terrorism, and forgery.Rana was released after seven years on compassionate grounds during the Covid-19 pandemic, following which India requested his extradition to face trial here, which the magistrate judge approved.Rana is a former Pakistan Army doctor who set up an immigration service after immigrating to Canada. The judgment mentioned Rana helping Headley get a five-year visa for India under the pretext of setting up a branch of his business there. Headley used the visa to help plot the Lashkar terror rampage by surveilling the Taj Hotel and other targets. Headley had informed Rana about the surveillance activities, the judgment said.Judge Smith also noted in the judgement that ""Rana commended the terrorists who carried out the attacks and stated that the people of India 'deserved it'.""","Tahawwur Hussain Rana is wanted for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.

Addressing the third Global South Summit India hosted virtually on Saturday, Modi said terrorism, extremism and separatism continued to pose serious threats to societies.After having listened to participating leaders from over 120 countries, Modi proposed a 'Global Development Compact ' that will be ""human-centric, multi-dimensional"" and, amid concerns over Chinese lending practices, not put needy countries under the burden of debt in the name of development finance.It will contribute in balanced and sustainable development of the partner countries, said Modi.""Under this 'Development Compact', we will focus on trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, technology sharing, project specific concessional finance and grants. To boost trade promotion activities, India will launch a special fund of $2.5 million,"" he said.Describing concerns about conflicts as a serious issue, Modi said solutions to these will depend on just and inclusive global governance, such institutions whose priorities give preference to the Global South, where developed countries fulfil their responsibilities and take steps to reduce the gap between Global North and South.The PM said earlier in his opening remarks that the technology divide and technology-related new economic and social challenges were also emerging. Looking to drive home India's point about the need for reforms of the UNSC and other global and financial institutions, Modi also said these had failed to meet the challenges of this century.India is committed to sharing its experiences, its capabilities with countries of Global South and wants to promote mutual trade, inclusive growth, progress of Sustainable Development Goals, and women-led development, he said.""In recent years, our mutual cooperation has been promoted by infrastructure, digital and energy connectivity. Let's learn from one another's experiences, share our capabilities, together transform our resolutions into success. Let us join together to get recognition for the two-third of humanity,"" said Modi, calling Global South unity the need of the hour. He recalled how India has been providing assistance to conflict zones like Gaza and Ukraine.","PM Narendra Modi appeals to the Global South to unite, speak in one voice and become each other's strength.

Gujarat high court upholds judge's dismissal for 'unsuitability',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-high-court-upholds-judges-dismissal-for-unsuitability/articleshow/112596458.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by a judge removed from service for 'unsuitability'. Besides the matter of her unsuitability for service, which was the grounds for her termination , the judge was also suspected of having forged the resignation letters of two other judges. However, the HC order did not mention this as a cause of any action against her.She failed to secure anticipatory bail from the higher courts for the alleged forgery .This case involved a civil judge (junior division), Mayuri Panchal, who was inducted in 2013 with a two-year probation period. Her probation was extended till March 2022, when an order simpliciter was issued for the termination of her services, stating that her performance was not satisfactory. During the extended probation period, a departmental inquiry against her over her conduct took place in 2017, but the HC decided not to act against her and her probation was extended further.In 2021, when she was posted at the court in Limbdi in Surendranagar district, the principal district judge received the resignation letters of two judges, who denied having written them. Two FIRs for forgery were lodged and a police investigation pointed to Panchal's involvement. In Dec 2022, she approached the HC for anticipatory bail, claiming that since she had ""issued notices against the collector, range IG, superintendent of police and police inspector, it had resulted in vindictive action against her"".Her anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the HC on the grounds that she should have approached a sessions court in Surendranagar district, which she said would be biased. She approached the Supreme Court but finally withdrew her pleas in May.Meanwhile, in March 2022, Panchal was asked to leave. She challenged her dismissal before the HC with her advocate asserting that the dismissal was based on her unsatisfactory performance till 2018, whereas her performance had improved after 2018. She continued to oppose her sacking as 'stigmatic' because it came after a departmental inquiry.However, the bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee turned down the petition, observing that her termination order does not indict her for any misconduct. Merely an inquiry against her on the principal district judge's report doesn't change the nature of the order of termination simpliciter into that of punishment because the HC's standing committee had not taken any action or formed any opinion on the inquiry report.While the issue of forging the resignation letters was discussed during the hearing of Panchal's petition, the HC order does not mention it as a cause of any action against her.","Mayuri Panchal was inducted in 2013 with a two-year probation period.

According to opposition BJP, Muda allocated Parvathi 14 sites totalling 38,284 sq-ft in an upscale Mysuru locality as compensation for land in Kesare village.

What does the

postmortem report

say?

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

CBI team arrives in Kolkata to begin investigation

KOLKATA: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after the police force had formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case.Read also: Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Case Live: IMA’s nationwide strike begins, here's what's open and closed; RG Kar Hospital vandalism victims recall night of horror On Sunday, investigators discovered the most compelling evidence against Sanjay Roy, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor.Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Roy's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack, said a senior cop.According to a senior police officer, the victim, despite being half-asleep, had put up a desperate fight against her attacker, and it was this struggle that provided investigators with the crucial evidence they needed to link Roy to the crime.“Rumours don’t help but harm probe,” the Kolkata Police wrote on their social media page after handing over all probe details to the CBI. They stated that they had done their best over the past four days and would continue to assist the CBI moving forward.The police also emphasised that certain ""misinformation"" being spread is either ""scientifically"" or ""legally"" impossible.The murder has triggered widespread outrage with doctors and nurses protesting in Kolkata and other parts of India. Outpatient services and routine surgeries were severely disrupted in government hospitals nationwide on Monday as resident doctors protested the rape and murder of a colleague at Kolkata's R G Kar Medical College and Hospital. The demonstrations were most prominent in Delhi and Kolkata, which became the focal points of the protest.The protesting doctors are calling for a CBI investigation into the incident and the urgent implementation of a central law to safeguard healthcare workers from violence.Sandip Ghosh , the principal of RG Kar Medical College , has resigned from his post in the wake of the incident. Within four hours, he was appointed as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College (CNMC).West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has warned the Kolkata police that the investigation will be transferred to the CBI if they are unable to solve the case by Sunday.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team has arrived in Kolkata to take over the investigation into the rape and murder of a female trainee doctor at a state-run medical college, as ordered by the Calcutta high court.Hours after the CBI filed an FIR in the RG Kar rape-murder case in New Delhi, the agency took custody of primary suspect, Sanjay Roy. They took him for a medical examination and began interrogating him at its CGO Complex office.Senior officials from New Delhi reached Kolkata Tuesday night and formed three teams. One team took custody of the accused, another visited RG Kar with forensic experts from CFSL Delhi, and the third team reviewed call records and other data from the victim’s mobile phone.Sources revealed that the CBI is investigating the victim’s activities in the hours leading up to her death, focusing on the people she interacted with or communicated. Kolkata Police has already provided related documents, case diary, CCTV footage from the hospital and items from the seizure list, including a Bluetooth earphone wire found at the crime scene.Initially, the accused was taken to Command Hospital, but they informed the team that they could not conduct the examination there. He was then transferred to BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah, where the medical process was completed. The CBI team, along with members of the Central Forensic Laboratory, arrived at RG Kar Hospital around 3.40 pm and proceeded directly to the seminar hall where the young doctor’s body was found on Friday.On Thursday, CBI officials visited the home of the doctor who was allegedly raped and murdered at a hospital in Kolkata. As part of their ongoing investigation, they spoke with her parents and gathered information about the timing of the call they received from the hospital, notifying them of their daughter's untimely death.The officers also inquired about the victim's friends and whether she had mentioned any issues or concerns at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital , where she was a postgraduate trainee doctor.In addition to speaking with the victim's parents, the CBI interrogated five doctors from the hospital, as well as the former medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal (MSVP), principal, and the head of the Chest Department where the victim's body was discovered. They also spoke with the officer-in-charge of the Tala police station, which has jurisdiction over the hospital.As part of their investigation, the CBI has requested detailed information about Civic Volunteer Sanjay Roy, who was arrested after the victim's body was found on Friday. This includes his call detail record and mobile tower location, among other relevant data.CBI officers on Friday questioned former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh at their office late into the night. The development came a while after Calcutta High Court posted Ghosh’s plea, seeking protection for him and his family, for hearing on Monday.Ghosh had resigned as principal on Monday, only to be put in charge of another state-run medical college and hospital around four hours later. A day later, the high court, expressing shock, had commented on Ghosh’s “power”, and ordered him to go on a long leave.On Friday, he was stopped by CBI officers near City Centre, Salt Lake, asked to get out of his car, and taken to the CBI office at the CGO Complex. At the time of going to press, more than 10 hours after he was taken in, he was still being questioned.","Civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year trainee doctor at Kar Hospital.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform. He would be happy with being the number one-ranked batter in ODIs. Who gives these rankings? On what basis are Babar Azam and Shubman Gill there?"" Basit said.Basit pointed out that the batters, who were standout performers in the World Cup, are conspicuously absent from the top ranks.Basit emphasized that during the 2023 World Cup, players like Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand, Quinton de Kock of South Africa, and Australia’s Travis Head made significant contributions, each scoring multiple centuries.Even Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman managed to notch up a century each.""Babar's last ODI was at the last year's World Cup. We saw the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Quinton de Kock, Travis Head and Virat Kohli at the World Cup. They scored three-four hundreds in the tournament. For Pakistan, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman scored a century each. What kind of ranking do they give?"" he remarked.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings.

Luckily her cries for help reached colleagues in adjacent rooms and they quickly gathered after which the assaulter tried to run away but was eventually nabbed. The dazed young woman, who suffered bruises, was taken to hospital and is now back in India where she is being counselled, said an official.Confirming the same, an AI spokesperson said: “We are deeply anguished by an unlawful incident of intrusion at a hotel, operated by a major international chain, that affected one of our crew members.We are providing all possible support to our colleague and their broader team, including professional counselling. Air India is also working with the local police to pursue the matter to the fullest extent of the law, and with the hotel management to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”The airline added that it “accords foremost priority to the safety, security and wellbeing of our crew and staff members” and requested “the privacy of those involved is respected.”The incident happened post shortly after midnight at Radisson Hotel London Heathrow. That night crew member of multiple AI flights were at the property. “The crew member was sleeping when an intruder attacked her in her room around 1.30 am. Startled, she woke up and screamed for help. He attacked her with a clothes hanger and dragged her on the floor as she tried to escape towards the door,” said sources.Her colleagues immediately came to her rescue. “She was badly bruised and the intruder tried to escape. The police were called in and she was taken to a hospital. She could not fly back on duty and a friend from the crew stayed back with her,” sources add.The police are probing the attack. “The intruder was arrested. He might have been a homeless person who walked into the hotel and managed to enter the room. The lack of security in the hotel is shocking. Luckily the crew member’s friends came to her rescue quickly and save her just in time,” sources say.AI pilots stay in Central London and the cabin crew in hotels near Heathrow . This alleged attack took place just a day after an 11-year-old Australian girl was stabbed eight times while visiting Leicester Square as a tourist with her mother.“The law and order situation in some parts of Britain, including London, as of now requires everyone there to be alert. We avoid going out alone after late evening these days in London. Only hotels with foolproof security systems must be selected for stay of crew members, especially when those properties are not in central but outer London,” said multiple pilots who have been operating flights to London.

She learnt about something she was not supposed to, doc’s parents ‘told cops’

KOLKATA: Did the 31-year-old PGT doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital know something she was not supposed to? Did she have to pay the price for knowing those ""secrets""? Was the rape and murder planned to silence her?These are some of the questions raised by her parents and colleagues , who have also been insisting that police volunteer Sanjoy Roy, the only person arrested so far, could be ""only a small fry or even a scapegoat and that real culprits are yet to be apprehended"".Details that police have so far pieced together from the deceased doctor's diary and from her parents indicated that she was under tremendous stress and work pressure the last few weeks.Being a second-year PGT doctor, she had already spent over a year at the government medical college and hospital. At such institutes, it is common for junior doctors to work 36 hours at a stretch. She wrote about the pressures in a diary.""We suspect it was not a simple case of rape and murder or that she was an accidental victim. She was targeted. How did the civic volunteer know she was in the seminar hall alone at that time? He could be part of a plot hatched by big fish,"" said a colleague.Others hinted at a medicine ""racket"". ""There are murmurs of a possible drug siphoning racket in her department that she was trying to expose. There is a reason for us to suspect this as she was upright,"" said another colleague.Several colleagues said ""punishment overwork"" was an ""SOP"", perfected under the watch of the previous management of RG Kar, led by former principal Sandip Ghosh. For faculty members who did not toe Ghosh's line, it would mean transfer, and for MBBS students, failing in exams.Some RG Kar Medical College and Hospital insiders said the PG trainee doctor was extremely hard working and was focussed on her career. She always wanted to be a doctor and chose medicine, though she had also cracked engineering entrance exam as well. She was elated when she secured a PG seat at RG Kar to study chest medicine.On August 9, after being informed about their daughter’s death, the woman’s parents had told police that she had spoken to them about tremendous work pressure. From her diary, it was evident that some colleagues were dumping a lot of work on her.Before the case was transferred to CBI, the parents had reportedly told police their daughter might have learnt about something in the department that she was not supposed to.

KOLKATA: CBI questioning of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital's former principal, Sandip Ghosh , which started on Friday afternoon, continued on Saturday, with only a short break, when Ghosh was allowed to go home. This is the longest interrogation session by CBI in any case in Bengal in the recent past.The marathon questioning - 23 hours and counting (till reports last came in) - began a day after CBI, led by joint director V Chandrasekhar, spoke to the parents of the deceased 31-year-old PG trainee doctor at their Sodepur residence.The parents have alleged that their daughter ""was under mental pressure and was reluctant to go to work"", and that the hospital had tried to pass off the rape-murder as suicide.Ghosh was allowed to go home for a short while at 2:30am. On Saturday, he was back at the probe agency's CGO complex office with several files in hand.Before going inside, a visibly tired and shaken Ghosh told media: ""CBI has not arrested me... Please don't spread false information. I have not been made to sit face-to-face with Sanjay (prime accused Sanjay Roy). They have questioned me. The matter is under investigation, and I cannot say anything more at this stage.""As per sources, CBI's special crime unit has bombarded Ghosh with a barrage of questions, including when he learnt of the doctor's death , who informed him and what steps he took on receiving the news. The former principal has claimed he is in no way linked to the death.On Friday, the investigating officers had questioned seven hospital staffers, including nurses, ward boys and security guards. Each of them was asked what exactly they were first told about the doctor's death. Sources said the specific question was asked to get to the bottom of the suicide theory initially floated. The sleuths also quizzed Ghosh's former colleagues - head of the chest department Arunava Dutta Chowdhury and former superintendent of the institute Sanjay Vashisth.The investigators are trying to piece together the sequence of events that led to the doctor's murder, and have recorded statements of more than 32 witnesses so far. On Saturday morning, a close friend of the victim also appeared before the investigators. CBI officers are now corroborating Ghosh's statement with those of the others.On Thursday, victim's parents told CBI they suspected arrested accused Sanjay Roy was not main culprit and was acting at the behest of others.

SRINAGAR: Election Commission’s announcement to hold assembly elections in J&K after a decade-long gap has sparked optimism, with parties such as Mehbooba Mufti ’s People’s Democratic Party ( PDP ) and Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference ( NC ) showing signs of a potential shift in their stand on participating in the electoral process.Until recently, both former CM Mehbooba and NC’s Omar Abdullah had maintained firm positions, stating they would not participate in any elections until J&K’s statehood, stripped after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, was restored.However, EC's announcement of elections in three phases from Sept 18 to Oct 1 appears to have altered the political landscape.PDP insiders suggested that Mehbooba is also likely to reconsider her decision to stay away from the elections, as pressure mounts from her party cadre urging her to participate.For his part, NC president Farooq Abdullah asked the party cadre to gear up for the polls, emphasising the need to strengthen its grassroots base. “We are committed to overall development of J&K,” he said Saturday in Jammu, while welcoming J&K BJP’s OBC wing general secretary and others into the NC fold.His son Omar had posted an image of his inked index finger on X, captioned: “The indelible ink mark from the recent elections hasn’t gone & we are back in election mode. Bring it on! We are ready!”Speaking to the media, Omar acknowledged the immense pressure from within his party to join the electoral race, citing concerns about the health of his father Farooq, who continues to lead NC despite advancing age and health challenges. “If I choose not to contest the assembly elections, there is a concern that he might be compelled to contest,” he said.Despite the presence of over 40 political parties in J&K, including Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP), many of these parties lack the organisational strength and visibility of PDP and NC, making the upcoming elections a critical battleground for the region’s dominant players.During the recent Lok Sabha polls, BJP had asked Kashmiris to vote for any candidate other than the ‘dynastic troika’ of NC, PDP and Congress. However, the results were surprising. BJP retained two seats in Jammu but failed in Kashmir and Ladakh. Omar lost to jailed independent candidate Engineer Rashid and Mufti to NC’s Mian Altaf, but Farooq Abdullah’s party still won two of the three LS seats in Kashmir."," EC's announcement of elections in three phases from Sept 18 to Oct 1 appears to have altered the political landscape.

""NC and PDP had come together and walk together as People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. There were claims that north and south poles had joined hands for the people's cause.

His stand benefits Maharashtra .""""What is wrong with Uddhav Thackeray's demand? Thackeray is a former chief minister. His face is acceptable to everyone. He didn't speak about himself. If anyone has the courage, they should declare their CM face,"" he added.Earlier, speaking at a meeting of the Maha Vikas Aghadi on Friday, Thackeray insisted that the Opposition alliance decide its chief ministerial face first rather than relying on the principle that the chief minister would be from the party which wins the largest number of seats. He would support any candidate decided by the Congress and NCP (SP).""First, decide (the CM's face) and then go ahead but do not go by this policy (those having the most seats will get the CM's post). Uddhav Thackeray will back any candidate announced by Congress and NCP (SP) as the CM face of MVA. I don't have the feeling that I am fighting for myself but it is for the rights of Maharashtra,"" he said.Thackeray said the experience he had during his alliance with the BJP was that whoever had the numbers would get the CM's post.""After our experience with BJP in alliance, we are of the view that we should not follow the policy of the party with the most number of MLAs in the alliance will get the CM post.

Also, the poll panel did not deem it proper to announce the Haryana polls separately while the poll process in J&K was still on.""The time between the completion of J&K poll process on October 6 and November 3, by when a new Haryana assembly should be in place, was not enough to accommodate the entire poll process, including the nomination procedure, campaign and polling.

Art on the rocks: The quest to discover Ladakh’s stunning open-air museum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/art-on-the-rocks-the-quest-to-discover-ladakhs-stunning-open-air-museum/articleshow/112595516.cms,"thang

Ahtushi Deshpande is no stranger to the stunning trans Himalayan moonscape of Ladakh . As a solo trekker, she has traversed the landscape swept by broad brushstrokes of browns, beige, purple, white and turquoise several times. And revelled in its utter solitude and surprising finds.None of it, however, prepared the writer and photographer for the spectacle at Kawathang , 100 km from Leh where, standing out against the dark patina of worn rocks were etchings — beautiful, spare, mysterious and abstract.Especially intriguing were the delicate hand impressions, elongated fingers stretching upward.What were they trying to say across at least 5,000 years? Did they mark a tribe, an identity, or were they a sign of welcome? In an obsessive quest over 13 years and 18 journeys, Deshpande has documented more than 200 such sites across Ladakh. They can be found along the riverine stretch of the Indus which runs for 400 km through Ladakh as well as along ancient trails. Some are simply parked in the middle of nowhere on vast desertic stony flats.It is a formidable project — the terrain is inhospitable and mind-bogglingly vast and temperatures can drop to minus 40 degrees C in winters while summers stay bone dry. But the etchings and the stories they tell, says the 55-year-old, were irresistible. “They are big outdoor museums of rock art , all done in situ, on the toughest and most ungiving canvas there can be. It made me realise that we have forgotten how hardy and resilient we can be as a human race,” she says.Some petroglyphs , as etched rocks are called, are known, some are hidden, and some simply a part of the mountain landscape that shepherds pass without a second look. There are hunting scenes on these rocks, rites of passage, scenes from community life, celebratory dancing and, of course, animals, most notably the ibex, a wild goat with dramatically arched horns. These densely engraved spare stick figures, which show great artistry, sophistication and imagination, have been captured in a stunningly illustrated book by Deshpande titled, ‘Speaking Stones: Rock Art of Ladakh’.There is an urgency to the work. Unlike cave art, which is still protected by its shelter dwelling, Ladakh’s petroglyphs stand open to the elements, and vulnerable to human interference. “Even in the 13 years I have travelled, I have seen rocks disappear, either into the waters or felled for road construction or painted over by graffiti or signage,” says Deshpande, stressing the need to preserve these ‘ancient canvases’. “The entire stretch along the Zanskar river along the Nimu to Chilling belt disappeared before my eyes in 2015 and many others have gone since.”There are two journeys subsumed in Deshpande’s quest: one through the rarified air of Ladakh and the other through the fragility of life itself. She is a three-time breast cancer survivor, and the disease arrived four years after her Ladakh quest began. But she would rather not let what she calls “an errant cell” overcome the narrative on her book. “Cancer divides your life into two — the one before and the one after diagnosis. But Ladakh gave me the purpose to keep going instead of allowing the fear to overwhelm me. I am alive today and that is all that counts,” she says, and this is a philosophy that also defines her work with cancer support groups.The earliest explorations of the petroglyphs began in 1905 with archaeologist August Hermann Francke but it was not until the 1980s, when access to the region became easier, that more research was undertaken. The most extensive academic work on the area was done by Martin Vernier, Laurianne Bruneau and Quentin Devers over the last 20 years. But the reason Deshpande’s work is pioneering is because it documents the complexities of rock art in an accessible manner, bringing together elements of anthropology, history and travel.It was fellow explorer and social anthropologist Viraf Mehta who introduced Deshpande to Ladakh’s petroglyphs and to Ldawa Thsangspa, a conservationist of this rock art in the region. Between them, they offered her the foundational pointers for her works, maps, books and research papers. But from then on it was a lonely journey, with the indispensable driver and an equally enthusiastic collaborator, Jigmet Dorjey.With no GPS markings, finding a site, even with a broad idea of its location, in Ladakh’s remote and monumental wastelands is unimaginably hard, says Deshpande.“It is a fragile ecosystem; the light can fade any time and you are up on a(large stretches of barren land) with no idea which way to turn – go around a mountain, or go up, walk around a river, turn left or right. Sometimes it is hard to even find a site you have visited. You have to bank on mental mapping. There are days when I have returned after a whole day of climbing and exploring with nothing in hand.”Ahtushi compares the finding of a piece of rock art to the joy of watching a negative slowly take form in her photographer father’s darkroom as a child. “The patina on the rock is highly reflective, revealing the art only from specific angles at times,” she says.The immense and striking piece of rock art that the photographer refers to as the ‘Stone Temple’ of Skindisa stands at the far end of an uninhabited site in Nubra valley. Reaching it involved a challenging hike into the wilderness. “We found it at the fag end of the valley, with no path to it,” she recalls.In the early years of her work, when Ladakh was not quite the travel hotspot it is now, there were few hotels or known homestays. She opted to travel in winters to keep her costs low and in far interiors, she would knock at the only available door and seek shelter and was never denied.There were many undocumented etched rocks that Deshpande stumbled on and documented but she is not interested in being credited as their “finder”. “These are works of art a shepherd probably crosses several times every day. Why would I want to claim to have discovered them,” she says.For her it is enough to offer readers a curated open-air museum through her visuals. Her photos travel to Paris this fall for an exhibition at the Médiathèque Edmond Rostand, where they will be displayed for two months.","Ahtushi Deshpande has documented more than 200 sites across Ladakh.

"Travel 2,000 years back at Mount Mary, set to unveil life-sized Biblical multimedia experience",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/travel-2000-years-back-at-mount-mary-set-to-unveil-life-sized-biblical-multimedia-experience/articleshow/112595432.cms,"For both Mumbaikars and visitors alike, Mount Mary’s Basilica in Bandra has long been more than a mere landmark or sanctuary but a gathering place for people of all faiths. Now, directly across this iconic site, nestled below the Mount Mary ‘Steps’ is a new cultural spot — ‘ Pranam Maria ’, an immersive experience that will take you through the story of Jesus Christ and His mother Mary, through 252 life-sized statues arranged in a theatrical multimedia environment that recreates the historical settings with incredible accuracy.A project of the Archdiocese of Mumbai and funded by Mount Mary’s Basilica, ‘Pranam Maria’ was officially inaugurated in May with Archbishop of Bombay, Oswald Cardinal Gracias, celebrating its completion. “The foundation stone was laid in 2008 after the late Msgr. Nereus Rodrigues, Basilica’s then rector, was inspired by a similar exhibition he saw at a Varansasi cathedral, envisioned it for the thousands who visit the Basilica,” says Joaquim dos Reis, a member of Archdiocese of Bombay’s finance committee who has been involved with the project since its inception. “We’re waiting for the occupancy certificate and hope to throw it open to the public in September.”Facing the Basilica, the facade of Pranam Maria’s experience centre features a stunning sculpture of The Holy Family—Joseph, Mary and Jesus—against a backdrop of seven boats and a towering Cross. The sculpture, crafted to resemble intricately carved wood, carries deep symbolism—of Jesus’s past as a carpenter and his future on the cross while the seven boats symbolise Mumbai’s seven islands and its rich fishing heritage, from Mazgaon and Mahim to the fishing villages along the city’s coastline.To enter the experience, you ascend a gentle slope from the side of the Steps and approach a concave building—designed to evoke a mother’s womb—encrusted with tiny mosaic tiles featuring an abstract painting and figure of ‘The Woman and the Dragon’, a Biblical scene depicting a pregnant woman, clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars, standing against a dragon poised to devour her child. Scripture verses run along the borders, while the main doors, painted with Alpha and Omega symbols, open outward in a welcoming gesture.“The idea was to create a sense of an open invitation,” explains Joe Cordo, adman and multimedia designer who ideated and created the experience. “We often see busloads of people arriving at the Basilica and walking around these stretches, yet many don’t fully know the story of Christ and Mary,” says Cordo, adding that the experience is meant to appeal to novices and scholars alike.A refreshing escape from the chaotic street outside, the fascinating 50-minute immersive multimedia winding trail is both timeless and of-the-moment. Each visitor will receive a headset with multiple language options and guided in groups of twelve by two hosts. “Currently, our master commentary is in English but the plan is to have all language options from Konkani to Marathi to Bengali,” says Cordo.Covering 10,000 square feet across two levels, each scene sweeps you back 2000 years. Guests are instantly enveloped in a custom musical score and dramatic storytelling as you wander through lush landscapes and watch sunsets over the Sea of Galilee, you'll step into rugged, cave-like homes and witness miracles, betrayals, and key Biblical moments unfolding in vivid, three-dimensional detail.An interplay of theatrical lights, music, and narration surround the lifelike statues and sculptures, guiding you gently through each powerful scene, wWhether you’re peering over Jesus’ shoulders, standing beside his apostles gathered around the supper table, walking side by side with the jeering crowd accompanying Jesus staggering under the weight of the cross he carries to Calvary or gazing up at Mary’s coronation.Creating the 252 life-sized statues for Pranam Maria began in 2018 right at the experience centre, which doubled as a workshop, says Cordo. The process involved constructing steel skeletons, moulding the figures in clay, and reinforcing them with fibreglass and plaster. Traditional artisans from VV Patkar’s studio, known for their expertise in classical Greek and Roman sculptures handled the sculpting, while the faces were painted by Rishikesh Deshmane, an alumnus of JJ School of Arts.“I pulled out books on Biblical art and history to get the anatomical details right, modelling each character with Middle Eastern features, their costumes and colours, architecture, landscapes, cosmic configurations, and various artefacts. The space and sky images, including nebulae and the sun, are high-resolution shots sourced from the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes,” adds Cordo.Bandra based Edward Mendes, a former data-matics expert, the system architect behind Pranam Maria’s audiovisual experience, spent three months perfecting the proprietary software that keeps the lighting, music, and commentary in sync. “The goal was to design a system that wouldn’t disrupt the flow between visitor groups. Guests use a smartphone with the Pranam Maria app to choose their language and follow along,” he explains.Dawn Cordo Gonsalves, music composer and director for the experience aimed to create something distinct. “Though the lyrics are from scriptures, all the music and melodies are new. For example, the Hebrew text from the Old Testament ‘Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara’ is performed by Dominique Cerejo, but the tune is entirely original,” says Gonsalves who chose Middle Eastern instruments like the daf, bamboo flute, oboe, clarinet, viola, and cello to enhance the mood and transitions between scenes.The team behind the experience—all locals—assures there’s no forced moral messaging. “We conducted trial walkthroughs with people of different communities to design the storytelling of Christ in a way that appeals to all. The idea is simply to invite visitors to be drawn into the mysteries and reflect on their own takeaways,” they say.","‘Pranam Maria’ is an immersive experience that will take you through the story of Jesus Christ and His mother Mary, through 252 life-sized statues.
