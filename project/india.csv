"Pannun case: Russia backs India, questions lack of evidence by US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-case-russia-backs-india-questions-lack-of-evidence-by-us/articleshow/109963886.cms,"with input from agency)

NEW DELHI: The Russian foreign ministry on Wednesday dismissed all allegations made by the US against India regarding a foiled assassination attempt plot involving pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun . The Russian ministry said that Washington has not provided enough evidence to implicate Indian involvement in the case.""According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,"" the official spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday.The United States lacks an understanding of the national mentality and historical context of India's state development, showing disrespect towards India as a nation, she said.Zakharova's remarks came in response to a media query on Moscow's reaction to accusations against an Indian official of a foiled ""assassination' plot, and the American news publication .'""The Washington Post', it seems to me, should use the term ""repressive regime' and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is hard to think of a more repressive government than Washington, in both domestic and international matters. Now directly about your question,"" Zakharova said, according to the readout of the briefing released by the Russian foreign ministry.""Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi (we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state . I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,"" she said.""This does not only apply to India. The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,"" she added.Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is identified as a terrorist designated by India, and he possesses citizenship from both America and Canada. In November, the US justice department revealed an indictment against an Indian individual for their suspected role in a thwarted plan to assassinate Pannun.Earlier, the external affairs ministry rejected a report in The Washington Post in April that named an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official's involvement in an alleged plot to kill Khalist terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US.Describing it as an ""unwarranted and unsubstantiated' imputation on a ""serious matter' that is under investigation, ministry of external affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was ""speculative and irresponsible'.Jaiswal also responded to media inquiries regarding a report in the Washington Post, a US national daily. He mentioned that an Indian government-appointed High-Level Committee is currently investigating security issues raised by the US government concerning networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and other individuals.""The report in question makes unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter. Currently, there is an investigation being conducted by the High-Level Committee established by the Government of India to address the security issues raised by the US government regarding networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and other individuals. Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful.""The Washington Post report claimed that a RAW official named Vikram Yadav instructed Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to murder Pannun outside his residence in New York.Gupta is currently in custody in the Czech Republic and faces pending extradition to the US to stand trial in the case. According to the report in the US Daily, the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the then-RAW chief Samant Goel.The US justice department has claimed that an Indian government employee (referred to as CC-1), who was not named in the indictment submitted in a federal court in Manhattan, enlisted an Indian individual named Nikhil Gupta to engage a hitman for the purpose of executing the assassination, which was prevented by US authorities, as per prosecutors.Gupta has been accused of murder-for-hire, which can result in a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Czech authorities apprehended and held Gupta on June 30, following the bilateral extradition agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic.Following this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a ""matter of concern' and is contrary to government policy.",The Russian foreign ministry dismissed all allegations made by the US against India regarding a foiled assassination attempt plot involving pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.

"For this 125-member Odisha clan, irrigation, jobs & potable water are issues that matter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-this-125-member-odisha-clan-irrigation-jobs-potable-water-are-issues-that-matter/articleshow/109963619.cms,"The Srichandan family of Odisha’s Khordha district has 125 members. While many of the younger lot have moved out to the cities for better prospects, they return twice a year to their 36-bedroom village home. For the family that depends on agriculture, the elephant menace in the region, drinking water scarcity and lack of irrigation facilities are major issues, besides absence of jobs in the state

BHUBANESWAR: There are some polling booths in the country with a handful of voters and then there’s the Srichandan family , whose members can demand a booth in their village just for themselves.The Srichandans are a family of 125 in Gayabandh village in Khordha district of Odisha, 80 of whom are eligible to vote. They have been living together, in a joint family setup, for four generations and the bond is as strong as ever, despite many having left home in search of better-paying jobs in cities.The family has a sprawling house with 36 bedrooms. For lunch, 16 kg of rice and 4 kg dal are cooked every day. Most members still depend on agriculture.Come elections and the family gets together to discuss candidates and votes. There is no pressure on anyone though. Unemployment, drinking water problem, elephant menace and lack of irrigation facilities are some of the issues that keep them worried.“Politics has changed over the years, so have the issues affecting us. Even after getting professional degrees, our children go out of the state for jobs. This even as people from other states are being appointed here,” said Ratnakar Srichandan, who at 85 is the eldest member of the family.Till 2014, the family sup ported the Congress as one of them, Dillip Srichandan, was a legislator from Khordha between 1995 and 2000. However, he lost in the 2009 and 2014 elections. “To serve the country and its people, we do not always need to contest elections,” said Dilip, who has made planting trees his mission in life. In this, he gets support from the rest of the family.Senior members like Gopal Srichandan, 80, feel there should be a change in govt. For youngsters like Smruti Ranjan, 23, and Biswajeet, 19, a first-time voter, candidates must focus on local issues.“Elephant menace, drinking water scarcity and lack of irrigation facilities are major issues. A proposed Manibhadra dam over Mahanadi would have helped irrigate 500 villages in several districts, including Khordha, but is yet to be completed. In summer, vil lagers have to depend on tankers for drinking water. The tankers come once in three days,” rued Gopal.The Srichandans – belonging to the Paika community – depend on farming as a major source of income. They grow paddy, vegetables and pulses for their own consumption. Besides, cashew, mango, jackfruit and guava are grown in over 200 acres of farmland.Men, including elders, are engaged in farming. But with time, many of the younger lot have moved out for em ployment. The whole family assembles twice a year – during Holi in March and Dussehra in October. Then there are important social events like weddings when they come together.The family has a fund, made up of earnings from farming, that covers daily expenses. Those working outside contribute to this kitty too. “We believe in living a frugal life though the family is financially sound and debt-free. We also invest in the education and business ventures of the younger lot,” said Madhu Sudan Srichandan, a third-generation member.“If you have ever lived in a joint family, you will not want to move out,” said Madhu Sudan. “The family is a huge support system. Love, affection, cooperation and adjustment keep us together. There are differences and misunderstandings, of course, but those are manageable.”","The Srichandan family of Odisha’s Khordha district has 125 members.

crosses its ‘threshold votes’, it gains disproportionately, and if its votes fall below this threshold, its seats fall dramatically.Since analysis of a party’s electoral performance is more focused on seats, people tend to ignore the fact that a party might not be winning seats but still remains a force on the ground. Other factors like elections From the time of Jan Sangh — 1951 to 1971 — to BJP’s ﬁrst election in 1984, the party had a low conversion ratio of votes into seats. Its vote share was always higher than its seat share. In 1984, it got 7.4% of the votes and 0.4% of the seats. From the next election onwards, when it crossed 11% of votes — which might be near the party’s seat conversion threshold — it saw a dramatic increase in seats.From 1989 onwards its seat share was always higher than vote share. Between 1984 and 2014, the party peaked in 1998-99, when it got around 24-26% of the votes and 34% of the seats. The next dramatic jump came in 2014. From 18.8% in 2009, vote share increased by 12.5 percentage points to reach 31.3%. Share in seats, however, improved by more than 30 percentage points — from 21.4% in 2009 to 51.9% in 2014.Congress, on the other hand, went on a different trajectory. In 2009, the party had got 28.6% of the votes and won 37.9% of the seats. In the next election, its vote share declined by 9 percentage points while seats came down by almost 30 percentage points. Despite getting around 20% votes in 2014 and 2019 – which seems to be lower than the party’s threshold – the party got less than 10% of the seats, indicating that seats alone are no benchmark to understand its ground presence.Between 2004 and 2009, the Left’s vote share increased by 0.4% while seats increased by 3.1%, indicating that for that election the party’s threshold was between 7% and 8% of votes. In the next election, the party saw a 0.6 percentage point dip in its vote share but the seat share came down by 6.4 percentage points.Trinamool Congress’ vote and seat shares show an interesting trend. Between 2004 and 2009, its vote share increased by 1.1 percentage points while seat share saw a 3.1 percentage point rise.For these elections, which were multi-cornered between the Left, Trinamool and Congress, the party’s threshold might be around 3% votes, and hence a small jump in votes gave a disproportionate gain in seats. Elections in West Bengal kept on becoming two-cornered, which might have pushed the threshold vote share. Between 2014 and 2019, when the election was between BJP and Trinamool, the party’s vote share increased by 0.4 percentage points while its seats dropped by 2.2 percentage points.Similarly,as the contest became more bipolar.Samajwadi Party saw a slight increase in its vote share butbecause of a similar reason.BSP, on the other hand, has a slightly different story.In 2019, its vote share declined but seat share increased. This happened because it contested fewer seats as it had allied with SP.For many parties like DMK and ADMK, the dedicated voters remain loyal as their vote share remains constant but seats might change dramatically. This could be because fence-sitting voters with no committed loyalty to DMK or ADMK switch votes in different elections. For instance, in the 2004, 2009 and 2014 LS elections, DMK’s vote share remained constant at 1.8% while its seats changed from 16 to 18 to 0 in the three elections.In 2019, its vote share increased by 0.6 percentage points while its seats increased by 4.4 percentage points. Similarly for ADMK, between 2009 and 2014, the vote share increased by 1.6 percentage points while the corresponding increase in seat share was more than 5 percentage points.","The first-past-the-post system of voting can often lead to counterintuitive outcomes.

NEW DELHI: Replying to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegations that the Congress has received money from businessmen Adani and Ambani , Congress leader Rahul Gandhi challenged the PM to initiate a CBI or ED investigation into the matter.Gandhi questioned whether PM Modi's comments about money being sent by businessmen in a tempo were based on his ""personal experience"".""The money that PM Modi has given to the two businessmen, the Congress party will give the same amount of money to the people of India through the various schemes that the party has promised,"" Gandhi said.""The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption,"" he said in a post in Hindi on X.""Modi ji, are you a little scared?

Is it your personal experience?"" Gandhi said.""Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,"" he said.Earlier, at an election rally in Telangana, PM Modi accused the Congress of having a ""deal"" with ""Ambani and Adani"" and questioned if the party had received ""tempo loads of black money"" from the businessmen in exchange for Rahul Gandhi's silence on the issue.PM Modi pointed out that the Congress had been criticizing Adani and Ambani for five years but suddenly stopped after the announcement of elections, suggesting that something suspicious had occurred.""Certainly something is fishy.

You have to answer the nation,"" the prime minister said.The Congress party has long been accusing the prime minister of favoring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.

Sam Pitroda quits Congress post after row over his racial remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sam-pitroda-quits-congress-post-after-row-over-his-racial-remarks/articleshow/109954643.cms,"Racist remark: PM Modi tears into 'Shehzade's Philosopher' Sam Pitroda

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda on Wednesday quit as the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress after a massive row over his racist remarks. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has accepted his resignation .""Sam Pitroda has decided to step down as Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress of his own accord. The Congress President has accepted his decision,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on X.Earlier in the day, Pitroda landed in controversy as he compared Indians from different parts of the nation to Chinese, Arabs, Whites and Africans while talking about diversity and democracy in India during an interview.""We are a shining example of democracy in the world...we could hold country together as diverse as India where people in East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arab, people in North look like maybe white and people in South look like Africa. Doesn't matter, we are all brothers and sisters,"" said the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.Soon after the clip of the remark went viral on social media, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lashed out at Sam Pitroda during his Telangana rally. ""I am very angry today... I am very angry with the remark made by Sam Pitroda"". The PM added, ""We will not accept this racist mentality"". PM also linked Pitroda's statement to Congress's decision of fielding a candidate against Droupadi Murmu for the presidential election in 2022.Pitroda has made controversial remarks in the past as well garnering the anger of opposition and the public.In the midst of awaiting the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in June 2023, Sam Pitroda claimed that the construction of temples would not provide solutions to the critical challenges faced by India, specifically highlighting the urgent matters of joblessness, rising prices, educational concerns, and healthcare issues.Sam Pitroda sparked another debate when he discussed the concept of inheritance tax in the United States. He explained, ""In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has 100 million USD worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair."" His comments stirred up controversy as he only gave the example of the United States. Pitroda's remark led to the BJP and PM Modi attacking Congress on the issue of ""wealth redistribution"".Another incident involving Pitroda was in wake of the Pulwama attack in February 2019, as he said, “I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. Attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.In response to a question about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Pitroda sparked yet another controversy in May 2019 with his dismissive remark, ""so what."" His statement quickly ignited a firestorm of outrage. Pitroda said: ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye.""Sam Pitroda had also faced backlash from the BJP in early 2024 after he shared an article authored by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide to prominent BJP leader LK Advani. The article in question argued that India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, played a more significant role in the creation of the Indian Constitution than BR Ambedkar. Pitroda's support prompted the BJP to criticise Congress, accusing it of being 'anti-Dalit'.","Sam Pitroda quit as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress on Wednesday.

Normally, you speak of Adani-Ambani in closed rooms. For the first time, you have taken their names in public. You even know that they send money in tempos, is that your personal experience? Send CBI-ED to them, get an inquiry done as soon as possible,” Rahul said in the message, hours after Modi made the surprise attack.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge joined in the counter-attack and said the PM had turned on his friends because of his fear of imminent defeat in elections.“Since April 3, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches,” Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said. He added that Congress had repeatedly demanded the formation of a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the “Modani scam” since Jan last year.Rushing to her brother’s defence, Priyanka Gandhi said, “The PM might be saying that Rahul does not take the name of Adani and Ambani, but the fact is that he (Rahul) does so every day. On the contrary, I feel the PM is giving a lot of clarifications these days. After all, he has given the nation’s wealth to billionaires. Airports, ports, roads or mines, you name it, and it is gone.”Kharge said Modi’s attack on his “own friends” was the best opinion poll on the first three phases of elections. “Time is changing... A friend is no more a friend. After completion of three phases of elections, the PM has started attacking his own friends,” he said.Congress general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal called the PM’s statement “laughable” and one that further “confirms his desperation after the drubbing in phase three”. He shared a video clip from Rahul’s speech on Tuesday in which the latter says, “You have to decide whether you want to make a govt of Modi and Adani or a govt of farmers, poor, tribals, Dalits and marginalised.”",Rahul Gandhi challenged the PM to send agencies to probe his own allegations that Ambani-Adani had sent crores to Congress.

"Purohit says framed by Karkare, PBS & then govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/purohit-says-framed-by-karkare-pbs-then-govt/articleshow/109958895.cms,"MUMBAI: In his final statement in the 2008 Malegaon blast trial in the special NIA court, accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit has said that all the police officers who carried out what he called the ""fabricated, orchestrated and concocted"" investigation - on the orders of Hemant Karkare (then ATS chief), Param Bir Singh (then joint commissioner of ATS), and Mohan Kulkarni (then ACP-ATS and investigating officer) - were part of a conspiracy hatched by the senior officers to suit the political requirements of the government of the day at the Centre and the state.A Congress-led govt was in office at the Centre and state when Purohit was arrested in 2008. He said that in Aug 2008, the president of a political party spoke about the existence of Hindu terrorists and the term 'Hindu terror' was coined. The coinage was immediately followed by the blast on Sept 29. The statement said these officers fabricated and planted evidence and were involved in the extra-judicial killings of wanted accused Ramchandra Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange and a witness.Purohit said that with witnesses turning hostile and bringing out the fact that they were tortured to extract statements as required by ATS and or their political masters, it was clear that the whole case against him was a ""concocted lie"". He said the officers had compromised national security, demoralised intelligence officers and permanently harmed Army's reputation.Purohit said that during his time as an intelligence officer, he initiated reports regarding ""fugitive terror accused and ISI agent"" Dawood Ibrahim, proclaimed fugitive Dr Ganapati of CPI (Maoist) and now-proclaimed fugitive Zakir Naik and illegal funding of his organisation.""The meeting was to streamline the arms, ammunition, war-like stores and drug supply from ISI, Pakistan, to left-wing extremists and Naxalites in Dandakaranya special committee xone operating in entire penninsular India, especially after these supplies stopped getting into India from Nepal,"" Purohit said.He said he was treated worse than a prisoner of war. Karkare and Singh insisted that he should own up to ""his role"" and name functionaries of RSS and VHP, and Yogi Adityanath, the then MP from Gorakhpur, UP, Purohit said.He claimed that while he was asked to leave a certain place on Nov 3, 2008, an ATS officer secretly requested him not to as there were orders to kill him the moment he got out of the premises.

He said he was brought to the city and ""brutally"" tortured after he was kept suspended by a rope tied to his wrist.Purohit claimed that both the ATS and NIA, the first and second agency to investigate the case, respectively, did not go through the relevant documents to reaffirm that his actions were in the line of his duty and his superiors were kept informed all the time. He said that they instead kept the investigation limited to suit their ulterior motives to implicate him to destroy the intelligence apparatus operating in Southern Command.Purohit alleged that Pakistan left no opportunity to equate the army, which he said was the finest in the world, with the rogue army of their own country. He said that Pakistan President Gen Parvez Musharraf went on to ask for his custody in the Samjhauta Express blast case, thanks to the ATS, which purportedly claimed that the explosives were provided by him.","Lt Col Prasad Purohit says all the police officers who carried out what he called the ""fabricated, orchestrated and concocted"" investigation were part of a conspiracy hatched by the senior officers.

Will back Congress if it wants to topple Saini government: Dushyant Chautala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/will-back-congress-if-it-wants-to-topple-saini-government-dushyant-chautala/articleshow/109958843.cms,"HISAR/SIRSA: BJP 's estranged ally JJP is ready to support Congress-led opposition's bid to topple the Nayab Singh Saini govt in Haryana, former deputy CM Dushyant Chautala declared on Wednesday, simultaneously firing a warning to his MLA colleagues that defying a whip to side with the saffron party would invite disqualification.Chautala's statement came a day after three Independent MLAs withdrew support from the BJP-led coalition, reducing its strength to 43 in what is effectively an 88-member assembly after the resignations last March by ex-CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala.Saini insisted there was no threat to his govt despite the coalition now being two short of a majority and that it would complete its tenure without a hitch. “We weren't a minority govt earlier and are not a minority now,” he said in Sirsa.Haryana is due for state elections in Oct. Although the BJP govt technically appears safe for now, three Independents withdrawing support could affect the party's prospects in the Lok Sabha poll. The state will vote in the fifth phase on May 25, with BJP facing the challenge of retaining all 10 seats it won in 2019.Dushyant, JJP's national senior vice-president, told reporters at his residence in Hisar that the party would write to the governor to ask the BJP govt to take a floor test to prove its majority. The rulebook stipulates that a no-confidence motion can't be moved against any govt within six months of the previous one, which in Haryana's case was in Feb.But Dushyant said CM Saini should either prove his majority in the assembly or immediately resign.The three Independents who withdrew support to the govt — Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) — said at a presser on Tuesday that they would back Congress , which has 30 MLAs in the House.Dushyant said JJP MLAs violating the party's whip risk facing the same treatment some rebel Congress legislators in Himachal Pradesh some time ago for turning against their party in the Rajya Sabha election.He said JJP had already issued notices to three MLAs for sharing the stage with rival parties. One of them could be JJP's Narwana MLA Ramniwas Surjakhera, who backed BJP's Sirsa candidate Ashok Tanwar at the saffron party's rally in his constituency on Wednesday. CM Saini led the campaign.The JJP MLA previously attended a rally by former CM Khattar, who is BJP's nominee for the Karnal seat.Khattar downplayed the withdrawal of support by three Independent MLAs, saying at roadshows in Nilokheri and Indri that such things were par for the course in politics.“It's election time, someone will join the party while someone will quit. It doesn't matter. Many MLAs are in contact with us. Hence, there's nothing to stress about,” he said.",JJP ready to support Congress-led opposition's bid to topple the Nayab Singh Saini govt in Haryana.

"Did Ambani-Adani buy Rahul's silence, says PM Modi; Congress hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-ambani-adani-buy-rahuls-silence-says-pm-modi-congress-hits-back/articleshow/109958842.cms,"For five years, Cong’s shehzada used to chant five industrialists, Ambani-Adani… But since elections were announced, these people (Cong) have stopped abusing them. Let him declare how much money has been taken from Ambani-Adani…how many sacks of black money? Have tempos full of currency notes reached Cong? What deal has been struck? PM Modi

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: In a curious twist to the electoral discourse on crony capitalism , PM Modi on Wednesday accused Congress of striking a deal with “Ambani and Adani” and asked if the party had received “tempo loads of black money” from the two businessmen in return for Rahul Gandhi to stop “abusing” them during the elections.“You must have seen, for the past five years, the Congress shehzada used to chant morning to evening...Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about ‘five industrialists’... then ‘Ambani-Adani’. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani,” the PM said at a rally in Karimnagar in Telangana.The PM said, “Mein aaj Telangana ki dharti se poochna chahta hoon… shehzade ghoshit kare ki chunaav mein yeh Ambani-Adani se kitna maal uthaya hai. Kaale dhan ke kitne bore bhar kar ke rupye maare hain? Kya tempo bhar kar ke notein Congress ke liye pahunchi hai kya? Kya sauda hua hai? (I ask from the soil of Telangana, let the shehzada declare how much money he has taken from Ambani-Adani these elections… how many sacks of black money? Have tempos full of currency notes reached Congress? What deal has been struck?)”PM Modi said there was certainly something fishy (“daal me kuch kaala hai”) as for five years, they (Congress and Rahul) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. “It means you have received some tempo loads of ‘chori ka maal’ (looted money),” he added.The PM accusing Congress of taking huge amounts of black money came as a surprise since he has been at the receiving end of the opposition party’s barbs on crony capitalism.While Congress rejected the charge by saying Rahul has consistently attacked Ambani and Adani, there were indications that BJP may not close the fresh front it has opened. Sources in BJP said unlike in the past, the campaign has seen Adani-Ambani ceasing to be Congress's main line of attack. “In any case, isn’t Ambani now missing from their concocted narrative of crony capitalism?” a source asked.Modi’s speech focused on alleged corruption in Telangana under the Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt with the PM suggesting that one part of the bribes earned by one “R” in Hyderabad was getting transferred to another “R” in New Delhi. Mentioning the Telugu blockbuster ‘RRR’, Modi said there was a discussion on an “RR Tax” in Telangana. “Even a child in Telangana knows about the double R tax... You all know about the RRR film but I was told that the RR have left behind the RRR film in collections. As you know, RRR earned more than Rs 1,000 crore but I was told that this much was collected by RR just in a few days, such a loot they have organised,” he said.Although the PM did not take any names, his mention of “RR” was seen as a reference to Rahul and Revanth Reddy. He said wherever Congress formed govt, its “ATM of money collection” started as he also mentioned unaccounted cash collected from the staff of a Jharkhand minister.Modi said Congress’s fuse was blown after the third phase of polling and that the INDIA bloc would need a microscope to find its winning seats after the fourth phase. “Congress was already, in any case, having to use magnifying glass to spot seats they could win. Now after three rounds of polling, they realise that they have to use a new, more powerful magnifying glass to identify the few they can still win,” he said.“Wherever there is Congress, there will be plenty of lies and fraud,” Modi said. “It is an anti-SC/ST/OBC party. One of the prominent faces of the Congress alliance has stated that all reservations must be given to Muslims. This despite Ambedkar making it clear that no religious reservations can be given. They have no respect for the Constitution. These people do not want SC, ST and OBC to come up and take away their seats,” he added.","PM Modi accused Congress of striking a deal with “Ambani and Adani’ and asked if the party had received “tempo loads of black money” from the two businessmen. “It means you have received some tempo loads of ‘chori ka maal’ (looted money),” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109958955,imgsize-1114414,width-400,resizemode-4/109958955.jpg"
'South Indians look like Africans ...': Sam Pitroda's racist remark stirs controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/south-indians-look-like-africans-sam-pitrodas-racist-remark-stirs-controversy/articleshow/109938796.cms,"Hamare desh ke bare mein thoda to samajh lo!

Congress disassociates itself from Pitroda's remark

zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sam Pitroda on Wednesday courted another controversy as he compared Indians from different parts of the nation to Chinese, Arabs, Whites and Africans while talking about diversity and democracy in India during an interview.""We are a shining example of democracy in the world...we could hold country together as diverse as India where people in East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arab, people in North look like maybe white and people in South look like Africa.Doesn't matter, we are all brothers and sisters,"" said the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.Soon after the clip of the remark went viral on social media, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lashed out at Sam Pitroda during his Telangana rally. ""I am very angry today... I am very angry with the remark made by Sam Pitroda"". The PM added, ""We will not accept this racist mentality"".""I can tolerate it when abuses are hurled at me, but not when they are hurled at my people. Can we decide a person's merit based on skin colour? Who permitted the 'Shehzada' (Rahul Gandhi) to look down on my people like that? We will not accept this racist mentality!"" said PM Modi.The Prime Minister also linked Pitroda's statement to Congress's decision of fielding a candidate against Droupadi Murmu for the presidential election in 2022.""I was thinking a lot that Droupadi Murmu who has a very good reputation and is the daughter of Adiwasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire. This philosophical uncle said that those who have black skin are from Africa. This means that you are abusing several people of the country on the basis of their skin colour,"" PM Modi said.Earlier, reacting to the racist remark of Sam Pitroda, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said: ""I am from North East and I look like an Indian.""The tweet posted by Assam chief minister read: ""Sam bhai, I am from the North East and I look like an Indian. We are a diverse country - we may look different but we are all one.(Have some understanding about our country).""Kangana Ranaut, BJP's Lok Sabha candidate from Himachal Pradesh's Mandi, reacted sharply to Pitroda's remark, calling it a ""racists and divisive jibes for Indians"".""Sam Pitroda is Rahul Gandhi’s mentor. Listen to his racist & divisive jibes for Indians. Their whole ideology is about divide & rule. It's sickening to call fellow Indians Chinese and African. Shame on Congress!"" Kangana wrote on X.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Pitroda's comment, saying ""he doesn't understand the country"". The BJP leader also said Pitrodia is the reason why Rahul Gandhi ""speaks nonsense"".""People in East look like Chinese, in South look like Africans..."" remark, BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad says, ""It becomes clear again and again that what does Sam Pitroda understand about India. It is clear that he is a failure. He doesn't understand the country. He is Rahul Gandhi's advisor. I can now understand why Rahul Gandhi speaks nonsense...This is the frustration of defeat. They neither understand India nor its heritage,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad told news agency ANI.Calling Pitrodia ""Shakuni"" of the Congress party, former Congress leader and BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan slammed his comment as ""vile and racist"".He said the senior Congress leader's remark ""exposes very clearly the bigoted & divisive mindset of the Congress leadership"".""Vile and racist statement by the Shakuni of the Congress party, Sam Pitroda has demeaned and insulted every one of our 140 crore Indians today. This also exposes very clearly the bigoted & divisive mindset of the Congress leadership...What kind of a perverse and parochial mindset is this?...It reflects the diseased and divisive mindset of the Congress party,"" Kesavan said.""Congress party owes an explanation...First, they need to take action & expel Sam Pitroda from the Congress party...Rahul Gandhi, on behalf of Congress party, should come before the nation and seek an unconditional apology for this racist, bigoted mindset of Congress party,"" he further added.The Congress has dissociated itself from the Pitroda's analogies, calling them ""mostunfortunate and unacceptable"".""The analogies drawn by Mr Sam Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are most unfortunate and unacceptable. The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,"" Jiram Ramesh, Congress's general secretary in-charge communications, posted on X.This is not the first time the Congress leader has triggered a political firestorm with his remarks.Pitroda had earlier expressed his support for the idea of an inheritance tax, drawing inspiration from the American system.He explained that in the United States, when a wealthy individual passes away, only a portion of their assets can be transferred to their children, while the government claims a significant share. Pitroda suggested that adopting a similar approach in India would be fair and beneficial for the public.Pitroda's ""inheritance tax"" remark led to the BJP and PM Modi attacking Congress on the issue of ""wealth redistribution"".Prime Minister Narendra Modi seized on his statement to step up a blistering attack on the ""wealth redistribution"" issue, saying """" is the opposition party's mantra to ""loot"" people.Later, the Congress party clarified its stance saying that sensationalising these remarks was an attempt at diverting attention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""malicious"" poll campaign.Pitroda also clarified that he had only mentioned the US inheritance tax as an example during a normal conversation on TV. He emphasised that his comments had nothing to do with the policy of any party, including the Congress.","Congress disassociates itself from Pitroda's remark.

India now world's 3rd largest solar power producer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-surpasses-japan-becomes-worlds-3rd-largest-solar-power-producer/articleshow/109945435.cms,"NEW DELHI: India surpassed Japan to claim the title of the world's third-largest solar power generator in 2023 as it has climbed from ninth ranking in 2015, according to a report from global energy think tank Ember.On Wednesday, the Global Electricity Review 2024 was published which offers a comprehensive examination of the global power landscape in 2023, drawing on data from individual countries.Accompanying this review is the world's inaugural open dataset on electricity generation in 2023, encompassing 80 nations that represent 92 percent of global electricity demand, along with historical data from 215 countries.""India's growth in solar generation in 2023 pushed the country past Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator. It has climbed from ranking ninth in 2015,"" the report said.In 2023, solar energy achieved a milestone as it contributed 5.5 percent to global production and India alone generated 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar energy.India experienced the world's fourth-largest surge in solar generation in 2023, adding 18 Terawatt hours (TWh) to its capacity, following China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh), and Brazil (+22 TWh). These top four countries collectively accounted for 75 percent of global solar growth that year.""A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality. Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace"", said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director.For the nineteenth consecutive year, solar maintained its status as the fastest-growing electricity source worldwide, outpacing coal in new electricity additions by more than twofold in 2023.The trajectory of solar energy has been accelerating rapidly. Global solar generation in 2023 exceeded six times that of 2015, with India experiencing a seventeen-fold increase during the same period. India's share of solar generation surged from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 5.8 percent in 2023.Pathways toward decarbonizing electricity underscore the pivotal role solar energy will play in shaping the future energy landscape.According to the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario, solar energy's contribution is projected to rise to 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030. The aim of tripling global renewables capacity by 2030, as agreed upon at COP28, holds promise in advancing this trajectory.India stands among the select few nations committed to tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Ember's analysis suggests that India will need to significantly ramp up annual capacity additions to meet this ambitious target.""Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change "", Aditya Lolla concluded.(With inputs from ANI)",India surpassed Japan to claim the title of the world's third-largest solar power generator in 2023. India alone generated 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar energy. Solar energy's contribution is projected to rise to 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109946265,imgsize-78682,width-400,resizemode-4/109946265.jpg"

MUMBAI: India is the origin of the largest number of international migrants – around 18 million, with large diasporas living in UAE, US and Saudi Arabia. It continued its march as the top country receiving remittances , but 2022 was spectacular with the figure crossing the $100 mark.According to the World Migration Report, 2024, released in Dhaka today, by UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM): ""In 2022, India, Mexico, and China were the top three remittance recipient countries, followed by the Philippines, France and Pakistan.""In 2022, India received $111 billion, the first country to reach and even surpass the $100 bn mark.In 2020, it had received $83 billion.Mexico, with inward remittances of $61 billion was the second-largest recipient in 2022, in the previous year it had replaced China to occupy the second spot and continued to hold sway.China’s inward remittances in 2022 were $51 billion. The contraction of remittance flows to China and its slipping to third spot has been attributed to multiple factors, including demographic shifts that have resulted in the shrinking of the working age population and the country’s zero-COVID policy, which prevented people from travelling abroad for work. During 2022, India’s other neighboring countries Pakistan (rank 6) saw an inflow of nearly $30 billion and Bangladesh (rank 8) received $21 billion.The report points out that international remittances have recovered from the dip in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Migrants sent an estimated $831 billion in international remittances globally in 2022, an increase from $791 billion in 2021 and significantly more than $717 billion in 2020.In 1970, there were just 84 million international migrants, which translated to 2.3% of the world’s population. In mid-2020 (which is the latest available data) nearly 280 million people lived in a country other than their country of birth, constituting 3.6% of the world’s population.The size of a migration corridor from ‘country A’ to ‘country B’ is measured as the number of people born in ‘country A’ who were residing in ‘country B’ at the time of the estimate. The Mexico to United States corridor is the largest in the world at nearly 11 million people. This is followed by the Syrian Arab Republic to Türkiye, and Russian to Ukraine corridors attributed largely to displacement of people owing to civil unrest and invasions.The India-UAE corridor is the fourth largest. An interactive map released by IOM shows that there were 3.47 million Indians in the UAE, followed by 2.7 million in the US (which was the sixth largest international migration corridor) and 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia (which occupied ninth position).The report does not separately reflect the top source countries of inward remittances to India, but understandably it would be from the top diaspora countries. Incidentally, the US and Saudi Arabia were the top two countries in the list of those sending remittances overseas. During 2022, $79 billion and $39 billion flowed from the US and Saudi Arabia to other countries.Net migration is the difference between the inflow of migrants into the country as opposed to those who migrate from the country overseas.For ten countries, the estimated net outflow of migrants exceeded one million over the period from 2010 through 2021. In many of these countries, the outflows were due to temporary labor movements, such as for Pakistan (net flow of −16.5 million), India (−3.5 million), Bangladesh (−2.9 million), Nepal (−1.6 million) and Sri Lanka (−1.0 million).Interestingly, India, which had the largest diaspora of nearly 18 million (1.3% of the global population) occupied the thirteen rank as a destination country, hosting 4.48 million migrants (0.3% of the global population).Countries in Asia are the origins of the largest number of internationally mobile students in the world. In 2021, more than 1 million internationally mobile students were from China, by far the highest number globally and more than double the number of students from India, which ranks second (around 508,000). The US is the largest destination country for internationally mobile students in the world (more than 833,000), followed by the UK (nearly 601,000), and Australia (around 378,000).","In 2022, India received $111 billion, the first country to reach and even surpass the $100 bn mark.

How young grads are helping craft poll narratives of veterans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-young-grads-are-helping-craft-poll-narratives-of-veterans/articleshow/109963028.cms,"MUMBAI: Talk of a paradigm shift in politics is often blah but young interns in campaign backrooms are part of just that. You won’t see them at rallies or on TV screens though. These are grads hired in large numbers by consulting firms specialising in communication and public relations, and well entrenched in the political space.Until 2014, poll strategies were devised through a process of trial and error based on public opinion.“But it’s a thing of the past now. After BJP’s 2014 win, they (politicians) started understanding the need for professionals who can gather and analyse data to be put to use,”said an employee of a top consulting firm.Months ahead of an election, political consulting firms deploy teams to interact with voters and seek their opinion on issues ranging from economic concerns to welfare benefits. This understanding of on-ground sentiment then feeds into campaign strategy. The firms also provide support in other areas such as managing media and communication, handling logistics and research and data analysis.A Nation with NaMo (NwN) employee told TOI that in the run-up to polls, NwN teams were split into campaign war rooms (CWRs), political war rooms (PWRs), and under the category governance, policy and intelligence (GPI). “CWRs have a client-facing role. They design campaigns for the client… provide them with a hundred solutions. It is up to them to implement which ones, if any,” he said. GPI, on the other hand, analyses data and handles preparation of manifestos.PWRs comprising field workers form the largest group. “For Rajasthan assembly’s 200 seats, some 80 people were working on ground to collect data. Just speaking to 10 people on an average every day, we were able to get 800 responses in a day and as many as 24,000 in a month,” he added.Given the extent of work, hiring, too, is on a large scale. Most of them are freshers looking for a break and they could be from B-schools, NLUs, or even IITs. But most of them are hired on a contractual basis and once elections are over, the CWRs and PWRs are dissolved. In NwN, there are two kinds of hires — short-term members (STMs) onboarded on a contractual basis and full-term members (FTMs), who are permanent employees hired as part of a Graduate Impact Leadership Programme (GILP). The FTM cohort is given extensive training. For those on contract, “they are directly thrown at the deep end”. Those hired for both categories are paid competitively, but STMs are not eligible for benefits, bonuses, and even the chances of them transitioning to an FTM are slim-to-none.An engineering graduate said, “NwN had stepped up hiring in the run-up to the polls and visited my campus. But they were large ly looking for people for the short term. Though a more permanent role would have been preferable, they had an interesting job description that got me to apply. The job market also hasn’t been the best, so you take what you get.”The pay offered is a deciding factor for many. Among his peers, the employee added, the average package on campus was Rs 9 lakh per annum. NwN was offering as much as Rs 18 lakh for a full-time role. Consulting firms I-PAC, Varahe Analytics, Inclusive minds, and ShowTime Consulting did not respond till the time of going to press, but their policies on staffing and pay may not differ much.The placement cell of Hindu College in Delhi told TOI that political consultancies have been hiring more aggressively, especially for summer interns. “But a key reason why students’ applications have shot up is not because of an interest in politics… it’s due to the lack of opportunities compared to other domains.”A former staff with Varahe Analytics said the average employee age in the industry is between 24 and 27 years, and a significant portion of hiring is via campus placements. “Young professionals are more efficient, driven, and can take the long hours,” he added. Another benefit with a younger cohort is they are largely party-agnostic. Though not a requirement, it plays to the analysts’ benefit when clients or roles change.Aakansha Patodia, an ex-consultant with a leading political consultancy, said youngsters are also chosen as they don’t have a hectic personal life. From the candidate’s viewpoint, Patodia believes motivations are two-fold. “The competitive pay, of course, is a determinant.

Why Andhra education barons are joining poll class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-andhra-education-barons-are-joining-poll-class/articleshow/109963027.cms,"On the face of it, these mundane headlines, that appeared over the past couple of years, may seem to have nothing to do with the ongoing Lok Sabha elections . But they do.In Andhra Pradesh, where clearing a competitive exam is seen as the only gateway to success and almost every second student appears for JEE or NEET, these headlines reflect the growing influence, both financial and political, of the founders of the various educational institutions .As more Andhra students clear entrance tests, owners of institutions that train them add more political heft for themselves.Although some of them have always been part of political parties , their numbers are growing every year. Information gleaned from election affidavits list hundreds of crores in assets for each educationalist contesting the elections. Also, safeguarding the interests of their institutions often aligns them closely with parties. A college chain donated Rs 5 crore in elec toral bonds to a leading party in Andhra even though very few educational institutions donated through bonds elsewhere in the country.These candidates contesting across different LS and assembly seats include prominent individuals such as Narayana educational institutions’ founder Ponguru Narayana, Vignan University vicechairman Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, Gitam deemedto-be-university president and Kautilya School of Public Policy founder M Sribharat, Avanthi educational institutions founder M Srinivasa Rao, and Sri Balaji Educational Society director Palle Sindhura Reddy.Additionally, Andhra Pradesh education minister Botcha Satyanarayana, who runs the Satya Institute of Technology and Management, and Pemmasani Chandrasekhar, founder of US edtech company UWorld, have also announced their candidacies.Take Ponguru Narayana of Narayana educational institutions, known for churning out JEE and NEET rankers. He is contesting in Nellore city assembly constituency on a TDP ticket. As the former minister for municipal administration and urban development from 2014 to 2019, he played a key role in the planning and design of Amaravati, the capital of bifurcated Andhra. Starting with a modest coaching centre serving just seven students, his organisation has now expanded to operate in 23 states. He declared assets worth about Rs 800 crore.State education minister Botcha Satyanarayana is contesting as an MLA candidate from Cheepurupalli. His wife Botcha Jhansi Lakshmi, who serves as Satya Institute’s correspondent, is YSRCP’s pick from the Vizag LS constituency.TDP has fielded another academic leader, M Sribharat, for the Vizag LS seat. Following the death of his grandfather, M V V S Murthi, a former MP and MLC, in a road crash in the USA in 2018, Sribharat ventured into politics. He narrowly lost in 2019 from the Vizag LS segment by 4,000 votes.Asked about how he balances politics and academic affairs, the Stanford alumnus said that his priority was serving and interacting with the public. “The university is managed by experts such as the vice-chancellor, pro VCs, registrar, and deans. They diligently follow the university’s vision plan. I often leverage technology to virtually interact with the university leadership,” Sribharat told TOI.Pemmasani Chandrasekhar, TDP candidate for the Guntur LS seat, recently hogged the spotlight by declaring assets worth Rs 5,705 crore — the highest in these LS elections. His pioneering online education enterprise, UWorld, is widely utilised by students preparing for high-stakes examinations such as SAT, ACT and USMLE.According to H Lajipathi Rai, former VC of Dr B R Ambedkar University, parties often prioritise educationalists who possess a combination of educational expertise and political family background. “These candidates are favoured because they are better equipped to understand complex issues and engage in meaningful deliberations in Parliament,” he said.Former minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, also known as ‘Avanthi’ Srinivasa Rao due to his association with the Avanthi Group of institutions, is contesting against former HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao as the YSRCP candidate from the Bheemili assembly seat. Avanthi began with a computer training institute and has since expanded to establish a network of management and engineering colleges across north coastal Andhra.V Hari Babu, a faculty member of political science at Andhra University, said founders of academic institutions are increasingly getting into politics. “Their expertise has the potential to contribute to the legislative processes, potentially resulting in more effective and progressive laws. However, political dynamics may differ significantly from academic settings. These leaders may face challenges in navigating the complexities of politics, especially in their formative political years,” he said.Narasaraopet MP and TDP LS candidate, Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, introduced the highest number of private member’s bills (seven) from Andhra in the 17th Lok Sabha.Lokam Madhavi, the BJP-TDPJana Sena alliance candidate for the Nellimarla assembly constituency, serves as vice-president of the Miracle Educational Society. With extensive experience in the IT industry, Madhavi has declared assets worth nearly Rs 900 crore. Her expertise is expected to be valuable in shaping policies.“While the Constitution doesn’t prohibit non-literates from contesting, having academic leaders serving as MLAs or MPs can benefit society. However, it is important to involve them in manifesto writing and policy formulation,” added Lajipathi Rai.","In Andhra Pradesh, where clearing a competitive exam is seen as the only gateway to success, almost every second student appears for JEE or NEET.

"267 years on, Mir Jafar’s progeny struggle to erase ‘traitor’ taint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/267-years-on-mir-jafars-progeny-struggle-to-erase-traitor-taint/articleshow/109963026.cms,"Lalbagh (Murshidabad) :

In Bengal’s political discourse, Mir Jafar ’s name has long been used as a synonym for ‘gaddar’ ( traitor ). Even 267 years after the decisive battle that brought Bengal under British control, the legacy runs so deep that Mir Jafar’s present-day heirs want to distance themselves from their forefather’s treachery.It was in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 that Mir Jafar, one of the most trusted generals of Bengal nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, defected to the British side, leading to the victory of the East India Company.TOI travelled to Mir Jafar’s birthplace to learn more about the legacy of deceit that continues to cast a shadow on the present. At Quila Nizamat, in Murshidabad, TOI met the 14th great-grandson of Mir Jafar, Syed Reza Ali Meerza, who lives a humble life and refers repeatedly to how the slur stubbornly haunts his family. His drawingcum-bedroom wall adorns portraits of all his ancestors, even nawab Siraj-udDaula, but not Mir Jafar.“I don’t want abuse from my guests,” he said candidly. In his early 80s, Meerza, known as Chhote Nawab, is agile and amiable despite a monumental decline in the family’s prestige and prosperity. He now rides a bicycle but vividly remembers going to school on a royal elephant.Wasn’t he disgusted with Mir Jafar’s being so widely used in elections to describe a political traitor? “What to do? I cannot alter the course of history associated with my 14th greatgrandfather’s name, nor can I change the popular coinage. Even though Mir Jafar was not part of the original conspiracy hatched by Ghaseti Begum, Jagat Seth, the company’s Qasimbazar chief William Watts. and Robert Clive at Sang-i-Dalan, Motijheel,” he said, feebly trying to defend his ancestor.Chhote Nawab’s son, Fahim Meerza, is a primary school teacher and the Trinamool councillor of ward 10 in the TMC-run Lalbagh Municipality. “My great-greatgrandfather Wasif Ali Meerza, who was educated at Sherborne School, Rugby School and Trinity College, largely redeemed the notoriety earned by Mir Jafar,” Fahim said.“On August 15, 1947, the Radcliffe Award allotted the district of Murshidabad to Pakistan, and the flag of Pakistan was hoisted at the Hazarduari Palace here. But within two days, because of Wasif Ali Meerza’s intervention, two dominions were exchanged. Khulna became part of Bangladesh, and the Indian flag was hoisted at Murshidabad’s grand palace on August 17, 1947. The Indian govt restored all his estates to him in 1953. He was the big gest champion of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood,” Fahim added.Later, a family member, Iskander Meerza, became Pakistan’s first president. “He went to Nawab Bahadur Institute and then went to Bombay for higher studies and later moved to Pakistan as a military officer,” said Chhote Nawab. His Murshidabad house lies in ruins for want of upkeep.Chhote Nawab, however, does not want to be buried in Jafarganj cemetery, Mir Jafar’s family burial ground. “Jodi kichuta kom gaali khai (That way, I’ll receive fewer abuses). People visiting his grave often spit on it in disgust. We then charge a Rs 500 penalty and wash the grave and put flowers and incense sticks,” said Laltan Hossain, a guide at the cemetery. He receives a salary of Rs 11 a month from the district treasury, an amount that hasn’t changed since the nawab’s days.The massive gateway to Mir Jafar’s palace at Jafarganj is still called Nemak Haram Deuri or Traitor’s Gate.","Mir Jafar was one of the most trusted generals of Bengal nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah.

"In Kuppam heat, Naidu locked in revival battle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-kuppam-heat-naidu-locked-in-revival-battle/articleshow/109963025.cms,"KUPPAM: At 74, TDP national president Nara Chandrababu Naidu is pulling out all the stops to reclaim the position of chief minister of Andhra Pradesh . However, he faces a tough challenge right in his backyard — Kuppam — where he’s seeking his eighth consecutive term in the 2024 elections.Naidu’s political journey began in 1978 when he contested from Chandragiri on a Congress ticket. He swiftly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the youngest ministers in T Anjaiah’s cabinet in 1980.However, his life took a turn in 1980 when he married Bhuvaneswari, the daughter of legendary actor N T Rama Rao.The emergence of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982, led by NTR, changed the political landscape of Andhra Pradesh. After facing defeat in 1983, Naidu jumped ship and joined TDP, shifting focus to the Kuppam constituency in Chittoor district, securing his maiden victory here in 1989.Naidu has now been the MLA of Kuppam for 35 years, serving thrice as CM between 1995-2004 and 2014-2019. However, the 2024 elections present a critical challenge for him both at the state level and in his very own constituency.After YSRCP reduced TDP to just 23 seats in the 2019 elections, they set their sights on unseating Naidu in Kuppam. The ruling party’s focus intensified after chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy entrusted minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy with the task of ending Naidu’s winning streak. YSRCP introduced the “Why not Kuppam” slogan and fielded MLC KRJ Bharat against Naidu, backed by local support.Bharat, the son of former IAS officer K Chandramouli, emerged as Naidu’s strongest contender, with the direct backing of the CM and minister Ped direddy Ramachandra Reddy.In response, Naidu coined “Bangaru Kuppam” to counter the campaign — ‘Bangaru’, a term of endearment to refer to someone beloved. He appointed MLC Kancherla Srikanth to handle constituency issues and thwart opposition strategies.Breaking from tradition, Naidu personally campaigned in this election, supported by his wife, Nara Bhuvaneswari, who joined him on the campaign trail to secure his 8th consecutive victory in Kuppam.As polling day approaches, both parties are leaving no stone unturned. The YSRCP aims to dethrone Naidu, while Naidu aims to secure a majority of 1 lakh votes, having seen his vote share decline drastically in the 2019 elections.“The people of Kuppam have been my strength and inspiration through my political journey,” Naidu said at a recent campaign rally. “Their trust and support have been unwavering, and I am committed to continuing to serve them with dedication and integrity.”Meanwhile, Bharat ex pressed confidence in connection with the voters. “Kuppam deserves effective representation and real change. I am here to be the voice of the people and address their concerns head-on,” he declared passionately, emphasising his determination to bring about a positive change in the constituency.Amid the campaign fervour, both parties are not only focusing on mobilising supporters but also on reaching out to undecided voters. With door-to-door campaigns, public rallies, and social media blitzes, every effort is being made to sway the voters in their favour.Adding to the drama, Kuppam’s residents express mixed feelings. “We’ve seen Naidu’s long reign, but now it’s time for change,” says a local vendor, capturing the sentiment of many. On the other hand, a retired schoolteacher defends Naidu, stat ing, “He’s brought development to our region. Why fix what’s not broken?”Local businesses are abuzz with discussions about the upcoming election. “This election will decide the fate of our town for the next few years,” says a shop owner, echoing the sentiments of many residents who see the election as a pivotal moment in Kuppam’s history.While the candidates trade barbs and promises, the people of Kuppam are weighing their options carefully. “I’ve always supported Naidu, but this time, I’m not so sure,” says a farmer, reflecting the uncertainty that pervades the electorate.With just days left until the election, as the candidates make their final push and the voters prepare to cast their ballots, one thing is certain — Kuppam is at the centre of attention, and the outcome of this election will reverberate far beyond its borders.","TDP national president Nara Chandrababu Naidu is seeking his eighth consecutive term in the 2024 elections.

Caste and poverty can’t be used to brand one as bad character: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cant-carry-raj-era-bias-to-tag-castes-tribes-history-sheeters/articleshow/109961239.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ruled that police cannot carry colonial era biases against persons belonging certain tribes and scheduled castes to mechanically brand them in their records as ‘bad characters’ or ‘history sheeters” and said such archaic mindset violated individuals’ right to dignity guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.After nudging the Delhi Police to amend the format for history sheeters, which was copied from 90-year-old Punjab Police Rules of 1934, to exclude the minor children and wife of a person from getting included with him as a bad character, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Vishwanathan on Tuesday asked all states to revisit their rules within six months regarding inclusion of a person in police’s ‘history sheeter/bad character’ record and weed out colonial era biases from relevant provisions.After deciding the case from Delhi, the bench resorted to its suo motu jurisdiction and examined the desirability of ensuring that no mechanical entries in ‘history sheet’ are made of innocent individuals, simply because they hail from socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, along with those belonging to backward communities, SCs and STs.Referring to certain studies on this aspect and without going into their authenticity, Justice Kant-led bench said these reveal a pattern of an unfair, prejudicial and atrocious mindset as they allege that police diaries are maintained selectively of individuals belonging to vimukta jatis (denotified tribes that were listed originally under Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, as criminal tribes because of their alleged addition to committing crimes) reflecting biases of colonial times.Writing the judgment, Justice Kant said, “All state governments are expected to take necessary preventive measures to safeguard such communities from being subjected to inexcusable targeting or prejudicial treatment. We must bear in mind that these preconceived notions often render them ‘invisible victims’ due to prevailing stereotypes associated with their communities, which may often impede their right to live a life with self-respect.”“Value for human dignity and life is deeply embedded in Article 21. The expression ‘life’ unequivocally includes the right to live a life worthy of human honour and all that goes along with it. Self-regard, social image, and an honest space for oneself in one’s surrounding society, are just as significant to a dignified life as are adequate food, clothing, and shelter,” he said.Referring to the court-nudged amendments to the Delhi Police rules on history sheeter/bad character, the bench said 'Delhi Model' would serve as a critical tool for states to weed out biases against certain tribes, castes and communities while preparing the internal record of history sheeters.It directed the states and UTs to “revisit their policy-regime and consider whether suitable amendments on the pattern of the Delhi Model” and asked the SC registry to send copies of the judgment to chief secretaries and DGPs for compliance within six months.","Justices Surya Kant and K V Vishwanathan asked all states to revisit their rules within six months regarding inclusion of a person in police’s ‘history sheeter/bad character’ record.

Putting forward the stand of the state govt that the central agency could not conduct a probe within its jurisdiction without its consent, Sibal said that it would destroy the federal structure if Centre forced its way into the state and conducted a probe.“Centre has no jurisdiction to allow its investigating agency to come in my state against my consent. Such an act is unconstitutional. It would be an encroachment on the rights and jurisdiction of the state and its police. It would be constitutional overreach and exceeding of jurisdiction and would destroy the federal structure of the country,” Sibal said. The lawyer referred to various sections of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to make a point that Centre controls CBI but clarified that role of Centre is only upto the registration of case but not investigation and probe was not influenced by it. Reading Section 4 of the Act, he said the superintendence of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in so far as it relates to investigation of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act shall vest in Central Vigilance Commission but the superintendence in all other matters shall vest in the central govt. He said section 5 empowers Centre to extend the powers and jurisdiction of CBI to any area .SG Tushar Mehta reiterated that original suit filed by the state under Article 131 of Constitution against it to not allow CBI probe was not maintainable and is an abuse of legal process. He said that article 131 could be invoked only in case of inter-governments dispute and the grievance of the state in this case was against the CBI and not the Union. The court reserved its order on maintainability of suit and said that it would deliver the verdict after summer vacation.The Centre had submitted that the suit was inherently not maintainable at all. “The Union and the DoPT have nothing to do with registration of cases by CBI, probe and prosecution of a case. We do not have administrative and supervisory power over. I cannot supervise and tell the agency on registration of cases or how to investigate or whether to file closure reports or chargesheet.

Money saved through zero or low-interest loans taxable: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/money-saved-through-zero-or-low-interest-loans-taxable-sc/articleshow/109959409.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a setback to the employees of public sector banks , the Supreme Court has ruled that the money saved by through availing interest free or low-interest loans from their employer would be liable to income tax as it upheld the validity of Section 17(2)(viii) of Income Tax Act and 3(7)(i) of IT Rules.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta gave this ruling on Tuesday while dismissing petitions by All India Bank Officers’ Confederation and a batch of appeals filed by staff unions and officers’ associations of various banks, who had challenged the validity of the provisions of IT Act and its rules allowing levying of tax on money saved through interest-free or low-interest loans advanced to bank employees.“The benefit enjoyed by bank employees from interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate is a unique benefit/advantage enjoyed by them. It is in the nature of a ‘perquisite’, and hence is liable to taxation,” the bench said.As per the Rule, when a bank employee avails a zero-interest or concessional loan, the amount he saved annually when compared to the amount paid by an ordinary person by taking a loan of same amount from State Bank of India that attracts market rate of interest, would be liable for income tax.Writing the judgment, Justice Khanna said the value of interest-free or concessional loans is to be treated as ‘other fringe benefit or amenity’ for being taxed as perquisite. “The employer’s grant of interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate will certainly qualify as a ‘fringe benefit’ and ‘perquisite’, as understood through its natural usage in common parlance,” he said.“Perquisite is a fringe benefit attached to the post held by the employee unlike ‘profit in lieu of salary’, which is a reward or recompense for past or future service. It is incidental to employment and in excess of or in addition to the salary. It is an advantage or benefit given because of employment, which otherwise would not be available,” the bench said.“We are of the opinion that the enactment of subordinate legislation for levying tax on interest free/concessional loans as a fringe benefit is within the rulemaking power under Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act. Section 17(2)(viii) itself, and the enactment of Rule 3(7)(i) is not a case of excessive delegation and falls within the parameters of permissible delegation,” it said.“Section 17(2) clearly delineates the legislative policy and lays down standards for the rule-making authority. Accordingly, Rule 3(7)(i) is intra vires Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act,” the SC said.Justices Khanna and Datta said, “Rule 3(7)(i) posits SBI’s rate of interest, that is the PLR, as the benchmark to determine the value of benefit to the assessee in comparison to the rate of interest charged by other individual banks. Fixation of SBI’s rate of interest as benchmark is neither an arbitrary nor unequal exercise of power.”",The Supreme Court has ruled that the money saved by through availing interest free or low-interest loans from their employer would be liable to income tax. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta gave this ruling on Tuesday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109959410,imgsize-643868,width-400,resizemode-4/109959410.jpg"
"Diet mantra for Indians: Less oil, sugar, avoid protein supplements",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/diet-mantra-for-indians-less-oil-sugar-avoid-protein-supplements/articleshow/109959360.cms,"Regular intake of protein powders not advised

HYDERABAD: After a 13-year hiatus, city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has revised its 'Dietary Guidelines for Indians', considering new scientific findings, lifestyle changes, diseases, and food habits. It advised Indians to restrict intake of sugar to 20-25 grams a day (a teaspoon is roughly 5.7g) since it comes from natural carbohydrates, avoid protein supplements and reduce oils.It also gave a thumbs-up for air-frying and granite-coated cookware.NIN also for the first time released guidelines for interpreting packaged food labels.ICMR director-general Dr Rajiv Bahl released the revised guidelines on Wednesday.One of the key suggestions is to decrease the use of cooking oil and obtain essential fatty acids through nuts, oilseeds, and seafood. Guidelines on ultra-processed foods were also provided.Dietary guidelines revised by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) after a hiatus of 13 years said protein supplements are best avoided as the benefits are not commensurate with risks. Protein powders are made from eggs, dairy milk, or plant sources such as soybeans, peas, and rice. ""Protein powders may also contain added sugars, non-caloric sweeteners, and additives such as artificial flavouring, hence, are not advisable for regular consumption. Proteins rich in branched-chain amino acids may increase the risk of non-communicable diseases. Consuming high levels of protein is therefore not advisable,"" NIN said.Research findings indicate dietary protein supplementation is associated with only a small increase in muscle strength and size during prolonged resistance exercise training (RET) in healthy adults. Protein intake levels greater than 1.6g/kg body weight/day do not contribute further to RET-induced gains.""A significant proportion of children suffer from impaired nutritional status. Concurrently, there is a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, creating a dual burden of malnutrition where both under-nutrition and obesity coexist within the same communities and households. Estimates show 56.4% of the total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets,"" said NIN director Dr Hemalatha R, chairperson of the committee that formulated the guidelines.",Dietary guidelines revised by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) after a hiatus of 13 years.

We stand by allegation on Nijjar killing: Canada; India warns separatists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-stand-by-allegation-on-nijjar-killing-canada-india-warns-separatists/articleshow/109959356.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after three Indian men were arrested in Canada for the killing of Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar, foreign minister Melanie Joly backed the police action saying Canada stood by its allegations that Indian agents murdered Nijjar, an India-designated terrorist.Speaking later on Tuesday, Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma accused foreign Sikh groups of crossing the ""big red line"" by casting an evil eye on the territorial integrity of India.""We stand by the allegations that a Canadian was killed on Canadian soil by Indian agents,"" Joly said.""The investigation by the RCMP is being done. I won't further comment and no other officials from our govt will further comment,"" she added.In his first remarks since the Nijjar arrests, Verma seemed to link the case to domestic crime, according to a CTV News report.""Indians will decide the fate of India, not the foreigners,"" Verma told the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations, a prominent think-tank. Verma also told the Council that relations between India and Canada are positive overall despite ""a lot of noise"".Verma also told the Council that relations between India and Canada are positive overall despite ""a lot of noise"".Verma also said the two countries are ""trying to resolve this issue."" ""We are ready to sit down at the table any day, and we are doing that,"" he said.Verma said the deeper problems underneath the recent ""negative"" developments have to do with Canada's misunderstanding of ""decades-old issues,"" which he blames Canadians of Indian origin for resurfacing.He said his chief concern is ""national-security threats emanating from the land of Canada,"" noting that India does not recognise dual nationality, so anyone who emigrates is considered a foreigner. ""Foreigners having, if I can call it, (an) evil eye on the territorial integrity of India - that is a big red line for us,"" he said.He did not specify whether he was referring to foreigners being involved in the Nijjar case or the issue of Sikh separatism more broadly, the report said.On Tuesday, India told Canada in a statement that celebration and glorification of violence should not be a part of any civilised society. Democratic countries which respect the rule of law should not allow intimidation by radical elements in the name of freedom of expression.Verma also mentioned ""so many positive things"" happening in the relationship between India and Canada.He noted the annual value of two-way trade is 26 billion Canadian dollars, and in the past 11 months, there has been a 75% jump in Canadian lentil exports and a 21% increase in Indian-prepared medicines reaching Canada.","Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma accused foreign Sikh groups of crossing the ""big red line"" by casting an evil eye on the territorial integrity of India.

Spurt in post-Covid measles cases reveals big gaps in vaccination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spurt-in-post-covid-measles-cases-reveals-big-gaps-in-vaccination/articleshow/109959350.cms,"More than one in nine eligible children nationally did not receive any dose of the measles vaccine in the 2019-21 period and nearly 30% received just one dose. This worrying fact came to light after frequent outbreaks of measles post-Covid prompted researchers from the health ministry's immunization division, Banaras Hindu University and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to take a closer look at vaccination data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5).In some districts in Uttar Pradesh, with high number of births, prevalence of zero-dose children was as high as 34.2% in Prayagraj and 32.2% in Hapur.In almost all northeastern states, zero-dose prevalence was roughly 25%.In a paper published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers investigated dose-wise measles vaccination coverage and explored gaps in immunization focusing on zero-dose, one-dose, and two-dose coverage among children aged 24-35 months. The study analysed information from 43,864 children taking into account socio-demographic variables such as birth order, wealth quintile, gender, social group, religion, residence, mother education, delivery-related factors, and media exposure.The study noted that a significant percentage of children receiving zero doses signalled a concerning gap in immunization coverage . The analysis showed considerable variations between states and districts in zero-dose prevalence. Even within a state, there were significant differences at the district level. For instance, in Arunachal Pradesh, West Siang district had the highest prevalence of children classified as zero-dose cases, 49.6%, while Lower Dibang Valley district had 2.8%. Another major cluster region was in UP where Prayagraj and Banda districts had 34.2% and 32.2% respectively, while in Hapur and Etawah 2.6% and 2.1% were zero-dose children.The analysis found children with higher birth orders and those from the poorest wealth quintile exhibited a higher percentage of zero doses. Mothers with lower levels of education showed increased odds of having zero-dose measles children. Additionally, mothers with limited media exposure demonstrated a higher probability of their children having a zero-dose status for measles.""Measles outbreak is considered an early warning sign for immunization programmes and can be effectively used as a signal for tracing missed and dropout children and overall systems strengthening. It is an ideal tracer as measles outbreaks visibly signal clusters with suboptimal immunization service delivery and can drive prioritisation of targeted interventions to improve programme performance and advocacy,"" stated the paper. Measles outbreaks were reported in 2022 from several districts of Maharashtra, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala and Delhi, and measles-related deaths were also recorded subsequently.With humans being the only reservoir for the measles virus and no documented evidence of asymptomatic carriers, it is believed it can be eliminated. In 2017, India adopted the 'National Strategic Plan for Achieving and Sustaining Measles and Rubella Elimination'. In Sept 2022, India adopted a roadmap for eliminating measles and rubella. There is an urgency to reach at least 95% coverage for both doses of measles vaccine as unvaccinated (zero-dose) children ""pose an immediate health risk, amplify disease transmission, and act as a barrier to the measles elimination goal"".""With consistent efforts, the country aims to catch up on the immunization gaps and vaccinate dropped-out and left-out children this year through Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 5.0 campaigns. So far six phases of Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) have been conducted from 2017 to 2022 with a focus on measles rubella (MR) elimination vaccinating approximately 1.9 million children,"" stated the paper.","More than one in nine eligible children nationally did not receive any dose of the measles vaccine in the 2019-21 period. Nearly 30% received just one dose. In almost all northeastern states, zero-dose prevalence was roughly 25%. Measles outbreaks were reported in 2022 from several districts of Maharashtra, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala and Delhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109959354,imgsize-15024,width-400,resizemode-4/109959354.jpg"

Before the CM's arrival, dozens of bulldozers reached the venue and, amid loud music, the machine operators performed stunts as the crowd cheered and 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans reverberated.BJP workers with party flags were seen on the dozer blades as the operators rotated the machines 360 degrees and used brakes and engine thrust to move the shock absorbers of the heavy vehicles up and down to simulate ""brake dance"" steps.However, the stunts did not go down well with BJP's Aliganj MLA Satyapal Singh Rathore. On seeing that the gathering was more interested in the bulldozer dance rather than the speeches delivered from the stage, Rathore first requested the BJP workers and the machine operators to stop their show. But the stunts intensified and the crowd increased, prompting the MLA to reprimand the bulldozer drivers and asked them not to carry on with the stunts as any mishap might happen.After the CM arrived, he said, ""We have invented a unique use of these machines to deal with criminals and anti-nationals....

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson's valiant effort of 86 runs off 46 balls, which included six sixes and eight boundaries, was not enough to secure a victory against Delhi Capitals. Nevertheless, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the race for the IPL 2024 purple cap.His dismissal in the 16th over, which sparked controversy due to a close call on the boundary line, led to Rajasthan finishing at 201-8, suffering their third loss of the season.Despite the defeat, Rajasthan Royals remain in second place on the points table with 16 points, behind leaders Kolkata Knight Riders on net run-rate. Delhi Capitals, with 12 points, are now tied with three other teams - Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants - as the race for the playoffs intensifies.The turning point of the match came when Shai Hope took a brilliant catch on the edge of the boundary at long-on to dismiss Samson. The Rajasthan captain exchanged words with the on-field umpires after the television umpire, Michael Gough, declared him out, as replays from one angle suggested that Hope might have touched the boundary line.Following Samson's dismissal, Rajasthan's run-chase faltered, losing five wickets for just 39 runs, with left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (2-25) striking twice in one over to seal the game for the home team.In the Purple Cap tally, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the top 10 after their impressive performances in Delhi Capitals' win over Rajasthan Royals. Mukesh currently occupies the sixth position with 15 wickets in eight matches, while Kuldeep, with 14 wickets, takes the eighth spot in the bowlers' leaderboard.SEE ALSO: IPL 2024 Orange Cap Standings Jasprit Bumrah continues to lead the Purple Cap table with 18 wickets in 12 matches, despite taking only one wicket against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings and KKR's Varun Chakaravarthy follow closely behind with 17 and 16 wickets, respectively.T Natarajan of Sunrisers Hyderabad has slipped from the top-three to fourth position with 15 wickets, while Arshdeep Singh of Punjab Kings rounds out the top five with 15 wickets as well.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth a total of $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109940827,imgsize-31764,width-400,resizemode-4/109940827.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a captivating IPL encounter, Sunil Narine's scintillating fifty and a collective bowling effort orchestrated Kolkata Knight Riders' resounding 98-run triumph over Lucknow Super Giants. Opting to field first, Lucknow Super Giants' decision backfired as Kolkata Knight Riders became the first team to breach the 200-run mark at the Ekana Stadium.Sunil Narine, once again showcasing his batting prowess, played a breathtaking innings of 81 runs off just 38 balls, unleashing a barrage of seven sixes and six fours, propelling the visitors to a commanding total of 235/6.Facing a daunting target, Lucknow Super Giants were under pressure from the outset.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are set to face off in a pivotal Indian Premier League match on Wednesday, both teams having accumulated 12 points from 11 games. SRH are marginally ahead in the race for the top four, thanks to a better net run rate. The upcoming clash is crucial for both sides as they aim to secure a spot in the playoffs.SRH, led by Pat Cummins , are looking to improve their batting performance after a series of losses.Their last defeat came against Mumbai Indians, where they failed to set a challenging target. Travis Head has been a standout player for SRH, but others, including Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen, have struggled to maintain form. Coach Daniel Vettori has emphasized the need for the middle order to contribute more consistently.On the bowling front, SRH have shown more promise, with T Natarajan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivering strong performances. Kumar's efforts were instrumental in SRH's narrow win against Rajasthan Royals.LSG, in contrast, are recovering from a disappointing outing against Kolkata Knight Riders, where they allowed the first-ever 200-plus score at the Ekana Stadium and were bowled out for 137. The team's captain, KL Rahul, and power hitters like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran have not been at their best. Ayush Badoni, an uncapped Indian talent, is also looking to make a significant impact after a quiet tournament so far.The bowling department for LSG has been hampered by injuries, with Mayank Yadav out of the IPL and Mohsin Khan also sidelined. The responsibility now falls on Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur , Stoinis, and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to step up their game.In their encounters thus far in the IPL, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have faced Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) three times, with LSG emerging victorious in each match. Despite SRH's efforts, they have been unable to secure a win against LSG in the tournament. This head-to-head record underscores LSG's dominance over SRH in their IPL clashes.The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has hosted a total of 75 IPL matches, with teams winning 34 times while batting first and 41 times while chasing.The average first innings total at this venue stands at 162.13 runs, with teams scoring at a rate of 8.13 runs per over and averaging 26.55 runs per wicket. The highest total recorded at this stadium was 277/3 by SRH against MI in 2024, while the lowest total was 80/10 by DC against SRH in 2013.In the last 10 matches played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, teams batting first have had a significant advantage, winning 8 out of 10 matches. The average first innings score in these matches was 185.4 runs, with the winning first-innings score averaging slightly higher at 192 runs. Teams have been particularly aggressive in the powerplay overs, averaging 56 runs, while maintaining a steady scoring rate of 53.7 runs in the death overs.The Hyderabad wicket has proven to be a paradise for batters at the start of IPL 2024, offering favourable conditions conducive to high-scoring encounters. Batsmen have relished the opportunity to capitalize on the true bounce and even pace, resulting in exhilarating contests with towering totals.However, when Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) hosted Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), the Hyderabad wicket took on a different character. It revealed its unpredictability, challenging both batsmen and bowlers alike with its variable behaviour, turning what was anticipated to be another run-fest into a more nuanced and strategic battle.1) The Hyderabad wicket, known for its even bounce and true pace, typically favours batsmen at the start of IPL 2024. With the pitch offering little assistance to bowlers, selecting top-order batsmen who can capitalize on the favourable batting conditions early in the innings could yield high fantasy points. Look for batsmen with a track record of scoring big on flat tracks.2) Despite its reputation as a batter-friendly surface, the Hyderabad wicket can throw surprises, especially when hosting specific matchups like SRH against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. In such contests, bowlers who can exploit any hint of unpredictability in the pitch and adapt their bowling strategy accordingly become valuable fantasy picks. Consider selecting bowlers with variations and the ability to thrive in challenging conditions.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik.T NatarajanKL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur.Arshin Kulkarni444 runs in 10 matchesTravis Head has been a formidable force for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in IPL 2024, amassing an impressive total of 444 runs in just 10 matches. The left-handed Australian batsman's explosive batting style, combined with his ability to build innings and accelerate when required, has made him a top fantasy pick, consistently delivering substantial points with his consistent performances at the crease.

The stylish right-handed batsman's consistency and ability to anchor the innings while also accelerating when needed have made him a reliable fantasy pick, capable of delivering substantial points with his batting abilities.13 wickets in 11 matchesPat Cummins has proven to be a pivotal asset for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in IPL 2024, showcasing his bowling prowess with a commendable tally of 13 wickets in 11 matches. The Australian fast bowler's ability to consistently trouble batsmen and pick up crucial breakthroughs has made him a valuable fantasy pick, offering the potential for significant points in each match he plays.

Rajasthan's chase looked promising after Samson's fifth half-century of the season, but his dismissal, caught in the deep and ruled clean by the third umpire, shifted the momentum in Delhi's favour. Rajasthan lost three more wickets in quick succession, and Delhi restricted them to 201-8, securing their sixth win in 12 matches.Spinner Kuldeep Yadav impressed with figures of 2-25, while fast bowlers Khaleel Ahmed and Mukesh Kumar also claimed two wickets each.
