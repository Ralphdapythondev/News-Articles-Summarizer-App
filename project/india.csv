'Kursi Bachao Budget'

NEW DELHI: Union Budget 2024 on Tuesday opened floodgates of goodies for ""ally"" states Andhra Pradesh and Bihar - reflecting the political compulsion of Modi 3.0 government which is dependent on the support of Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar for its survival.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not have accepted the demand for ""special category status"" for the two states, but his finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several schemes and incentives to keep the two leaders in good humour.From tourism and industry push in Bihar to capital needs of Andhra Pradesh, Sitharaman's Budget had a lot for the two states.Chandrababu Naidu's TDP with 16 members in Lok Sabha and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) with 12 members play a crucial role in keeping the NDA 3.0 government afloat after the BJP could manage only 240 seats, 32 short of majority, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech announced special financial support of Rs 15,000 crore for the new capital of Andhra Pradesh in the current financial year and also promised additional amounts in future.The Centre also committed itself to financing and early completion of the Polavaram Irrigation Project, calling it the lifeline for Andhra Pradesh and its farmers.The Budget also pushed for industrial development of the state as it promised funds for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways and roads in Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor and Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.Sitharaman also announced additional allocation towards capital investment for economic growth of the state and grants for backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam and North Coastal Andhra, as stated in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.The other state to benefit hugely from Modi government's Budget largesse is Bihar. Sitharaman announced to provide additional allocation to support capital investments in the state and promised to expedite requests of Bihar government for external assistance from multilateral development banks.The Budget announced support for comprehensive development of Vishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor, which have been modelled on the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, to transform them into world class pilgrim and tourist destinations.Sitharaman also promised Centre's support for development of road connectivity projects in the state at a cost of Rs 26,000 crore. The projects that found mention in the Budget included: Patna-Purnea Expressway, Buxar-Bhagalpur Expressway, Bodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and additional 2-lane bridge over river Ganga at Buxar.The Centre announced support of Rs 21,400 crore for setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti and spoke of constructing new airports, medical colleges and sports infrastructure in the state.Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar were quick to thank Prime Minister Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.""On behalf of the people of Andhra Pradesh, I thank the Hon'ble Prime Minister, @narendramodi Ji and Hon'ble Union Finance Minister, @nsitharaman Ji, for recognising the needs of our State and focusing on a Capital, Polavaram, industrial nodes and development of backward areas in AP in the union budget of FY 24-25. This support from the Centre will go a long way towards rebuilding Andhra Pradesh. I congratulate you on the presentation of this progressive and confidence-boosting budget,"" Naidu said in a statement.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar claimed victory over Budget allocations for the state. ""I told them (NDA) to either give us a special status or a special package. As a follow-up, they have announced aid for a lot of things. We were demanding special status and a lot of people said that provision for special status has been done away with. So, instead of that, aid should be given for helping Bihar which has now started,"" Nitish Kumar said.With so much of focus on the two states, the opposition was quick to call Modi 3.0 first Budget as ""Kursi bachao Budget"". "" 'Kursi Bachao' Budget. Appease Allies: Hollow promises to them at the cost of other states. Appease Cronies: Benefits to AA with no relief for the common Indian. Copy and Paste: Congress manifesto and previous budgets,"" Rahul Gandhi posted on X.Congress alleged that several announcements in the Budget were copy-pasted from the party's 2024 manifesto. Senior P Chidambaram took a swipe at the government and said he is glad that finance minister Sitharaman has read the Congress 2024 manifesto after the Lok Sabha poll results.In a post on X, Chidambaram said, ""I am glad to know that the Hon'ble FM has read the Congress Manifesto LS 2024 after the election results. I am happy she has virtually adopted the Employment-linked incentive (ELI) outlined on page 30 of the Congress Manifesto.""""I am also happy that she has introduced the Apprenticeship scheme along with an allowance to every apprentice spelt out on page 11 of the Congress Manifesto.

""I can answer. I am the amicus.""The Chief Justice retorted, ""I have not appointed any amicus.""The advocate persisted, ""If you don't respect me, I will leave.""This was followed by a stern response from the Chief Justice. ""Mr Nedumpara, I am cautioning you. You will not address the gallery. I am presiding over the court. Please summon security and have him escorted out of the courtroom,"" he said.To this, the lawyer replied, ""I am leaving. I am going."" The Chief Justice reiterated, ""You need not state that, you may leave. I have witnessed the judiciary for the past 24 years. I cannot allow lawyers to dictate proceedings in this court.""Nedumpara continued, ""I have witnessed it since 1979."" The Chief Justice then admonished him that he may have to issue a directive. ""I may be compelled to issue something that is not equitable. You will not interrupt any other lawyer,"" he said. The lawyer eventually departed. He returned to the court subsequently.This is not the first instance where Mathews Nedumpara has been reprimanded by the Chief Justice for his conduct in the courtroom. In March this year, during the hearing in the Electoral Bonds case, the lawyer sought to intervene and kept interrupting. At one point, the Chief Justice firmly stated, ""Don't shout at me...

If you desire to file an application, submit it via email. That is the rule in this court.""In its decision, the apex court said the 2024 NEET-UG exam will not be reconducted.

"Supreme Court: No NEET-UG retest, but 4 lakh candidates to lose 5 marks each",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-no-neet-ug-retest-but-4-lakh-candidates-to-lose-5-marks-each/articleshow/111969731.cms,"'Won't Allow You To Dictate': Ugly Scenes In SC As CJI Clashes With NEET Lawyer | Watch

Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected pleas for a retest for admissions to 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in govt and private medical colleges in the absence of evidence to establish that the exam paper leak in Hazaribag vitiated the results or breached the examination’s sanctity and integrity, a verdict that lifted the haze of uncertainty that had hung over NEET-UG while also ending the anxiety that had faced those likely to fetch the much-coveted seats in medical colleges across the country.However, 4.2 lakh students who had got 4 marks even after choosing a wrong option to an atomic theory question stand to lose 5 marks (4 for the question and 1 negative mark for answering it wrongly) as the SC accepted the IIT-Delhi expert committee’s report, which termed only one option as correct.This will entail a huge reshuffle of ranks. One of the toppers had secured 720 out of 720 despite picking the wrong option, which along with the right option was deemed correct by NTA due to an error in the previous year's NCERT physics book. Her score will now drop to 715, which will drag her rank several notches down and will be inadequate to get admission to the MBBS course in AIIMS-Delhi, her counsel said.After a four-day hearing, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra dictated the order in open court much after business hours and said, “At the present stage, there is an absence of material on record sufficient to lead to the conclusion that results of the examination stands vitiated or that there was a systemic breach in the sanctity of the examination.”The bench said a detailed judgment would follow in a few days and that it had dictated the operative portion of the decision keeping in mind the uncertainty in the minds of 23.33 lakh students, who had appeared in NEET-UG 2024. Counselling for admissions to MBBS courses is scheduled to commence on Wednesday.CJI Chandrachud, who dictated the order, said, “Adding to the absence of conclusive material on record at the present stage, the city-wise and centre-wise data placed on record by National Testing Agency (NTA) and a comparison of NEET-UG results for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 is not indicative of a systemic leak of question paper (this year), which would indicate destruction of the sanctity of examination.“In arriving at the ultimate conclusion, the court is guided by the ultimate test whether it is possible to segregate tainted students from those whose candidature does not suffer from any taint.”The court's determination also marked validation of the NTA and the Centre, which maintained that the leak in Hazaribag was a localised affair and did not compromise the integrity of the exam and, therefore, NEET-UG need not be scrapped.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and CBI additional director Krishna informed the court that so far, the probe had found that the impact of question paper leak was limited to Hazaribag and Patna and that only 155 candidates benefited from it, even though only two of them secured more than 570 marks. The bench took note of Mehta’s argument that candidature of the 155 candidates had been cancelled and they may get debarred from appearing in NEET-UG in future. The SG also said admission of any candidate, if later found to have indulged in wrongdoing or taken advantage of question paper leak, would be cancelled as and when it was detected.The bench said, “If investigation reveals involvement of an increased number of beneficiaries (of question paper leak), then action shall be pursued against those students who are found involved in wrongdoing at any stage, notwithstanding the completion of the counselling process. No student who has engaged in acts of fraud and is a beneficiary of malpractices would be entitled to claim vested right to admission in future.”Accepting Mehta’s argument on the leak being localised given the fact that the test was conducted in 4,750 centres in 571 cities and that cancellation of the entire examination would cause serious inconvenience to honest students who had assiduously prepared for the test for three to four years, the bench said, “The court is also mindful of the fact that directing a fresh NEET-UG test for the present year would be replete with serious consequences as more than 2 million students took the examination.“It would disrupt admission schedules for the medical courses, have a cascading effect on medical examinations, prejudicially impact availability of qualified medical professionals in future, and seriously disadvantage students from marginalised groups — SC, ST, OBC and EWS — for whom reservation has been made in the allocation of seats.”The bench further said, “For the above reasons, we are of the considered view that ordering cancellation of the entire NEET-UG examination is neither justified on the application of the settled position of this court or on the basis of the material on record.”Assuring the petitioners, who through lead counsel Narender Hooda and Sanjay Hegde had pleaded for a retest, the bench said it would independently verify the data submitted by NTA even after IIT-Madras on application of data analytics had found no abnormal trend in the results of NEET-UG 2024 in various centres, including Hazaribag and Patna.The SC said individual grievances of candidates, including improper evaluation of their OMR (answer) sheets, would have to be raised before jurisdictional high courts after withdrawing their pleas from the apex court.",Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected pleas for a retest for admissions to 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in govt and private medical colleges. 4.2 lakh students who had got 4 marks even after choosing a wrong option to an atomic theory question stand to lose 5 marks.

'Numbers don't lie': How first budget of Modi 3.0 reflects changed political reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/numbers-dont-lie-how-first-budget-of-modi-3-0-reflects-changed-political-reality/articleshow/111964875.cms,"NEW DELHI: When finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget in February 2024, many were expecting it to be full of freebies with an eye on the 2024 general election. There were expectations that the government may announce tax cuts for the middle class and extra incentives for farmers and rural areas. But the Modi government did not announce much-anticipated freebies in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections .However, the interim budget was presented when the BJP commanded a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own. Officially, it was an NDA government but PM Modi was not dependent on allies for his survival. But things changed after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. After 10 years in power, the BJP failed to win a majority on its own in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In a first for PM Modi, his government is now dependent on support from Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) for its survival.It is said ""numbers don't lie"". This seems obvious from the first budget of the Modi government 3.0. There is no doubt the Union Budget 2024-25 has been prepared keeping in mind the reality of changed numbers in the 18th Lok Sabha.This changed reality is self-evident in today's budget. Hence, no one should be surprised as the FM announced a host of bonanzas for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. The budget is full of schemes for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. Throughout her Budget speech, Sitharaman kept announcing special projects and funds for these two states.For details, read these stories on specific announcements for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh Next, another big focus of the Budget is on youth and jobs creation. ""I am happy to announce the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over a five-year period with a central outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore,"" the finance minister said.The jobless-growth was one of the main criticisms of Rahul Gandhi against the Modi government. The government seems to have taken a leaf out of Congress's Lok Sabha manifesto and announced an internship scheme which would benefit 1 crore youth.""This budget serves as an acknowledgement of the jobs problem facing the economy. The word ‘unemployment’ never featured even once in the BJP election manifesto, said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale SA. The fact that there was a clear focus toward employment generation now shows the nature of the issue the government is dealing with,"" a Bloomberg report said.To be fair to the Modi government, there are no great freebies in the Budget. At the same time, the government plans to cut its fiscal deficit to 4.9% of gross domestic product in 2024-25, below the 5.1% figure in February's interim budget.""The budget successfully engineered a fine balance between supporting job creation and skilling, rural development and agriculture, along with continued focus on infrastructure spending without compromising on fiscal consolidation,"" Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank, told Reuters.But the budget is not all about elections and immediate gains. Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand are set to go for assembly polls during the last quarter of the year. But there are no specific announcements for these states. So, in a way, this is also a signal that PM Modi is not looking at elections only and playing a long-term game too.In the end, the budget has helped PM Modi keep Andhra, Bihar CMs on the right side. At the same time, it has done a fine balancing act between fiscal prudence and political exigencies.Now, it's over to voters in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand. These three state polls will decide the next set of political manoeuvring by the Modi government and INDIA bloc.","Modi government did not announce much-anticipated freebies in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections.

The warship got flooded in the extensive fire-fighting operations to douse the fire, which led to the vessel first “listing” and then eventually tipping over on Monday afternoon.“Admiral Tripathi reviewed the damage to the warship. He also met the crew of INS Brahmaputra and talked about the plan being formulated to get their ship operational as early as possible,” an official said.It will, however, be a tough task to salvage INS Brahmaputra, which has a displacement of 3,850-tonne and is now resting on its port side on the jetty. It had taken almost three months to get another such frigate INS Betwa upright with the help of international salvage experts after she had also keeled over after slipping from her dock blocks at the Mumbai naval dockyard in Dec 2016.It had taken much more time to then make INS Betwa seaworthy and operational. Another frigate INS Vindhyagiri, which also faced a major fire and flooding after a collision in 2011, however, had to be decommissioned after being salvaged at great cost and effort.",Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi visited Mumbai to review the overall state of guided- missile frigate INS Brahmaputra.

After opening the trunks using the toolkit, he took pictures of the question paper booklet using a mobile phone and left the strongroom at 9.23am. Immediately, he sent it to one of his associates who took a printout and gave it to 7-8 solvers who made available solved question papers of botany and zoology at 10.15am and physics and chemistry at 10.40am.None of the solvers were allowed to take mobile phones as the gang wanted to keep dissemination of the solved questions to a target group of 155 students, whose parents had paid advance token money. They had issued post-dated cheques, which would have been encased if the question paper matched with the leaked one, CBI said.Since they wanted to monetise the leaked question paper without risking cancellation of the entire examination which would happen in case of a widespread leak, the target groups of students were gathered at pre-selected places in Patna and Hazaribag and were made to memorise the answers as much as possible in two hours.After the examination, they attempted to burn the printout of the leaked question paper and destroyed the mobile phone used for taking photos of the questions and for transmitting from Hazaribag to Patna, CBI told the court. Each question paper has a unique code printed on it and the half burnt question paper, a photo of the original, led the CBI to Hazaribag and the gang members, additional director of CBI Krishna told the SC. He said 18 mobiles from fringe elements have been seized and sent for forensic examination.On the petitioner's allegation that the question paper was available on Telegram social media platform on May 4, the solicitor general told the court that the Telegram group, which posted the question paper, was created on May 6 and the question paper was uploaded on May 6-7 night a day after the examination. The group tampered with the timestamp on the Telegram post while uploading the question paper to create a false narrative that the question paper was leaked a day before the examination, Mehta said.","CBI reached members of NEET-UG question paper leak gang by the providential recovery by Bihar Police of a partly burnt leaked question paper.

The issue will now be adjudicated by a larger bench .A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol took contradictory stands on the validity of the recommendation of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) and the Centre for allowing environmental release of DMH-11 to allow its field trial.As the court had earlier stayed the field trial, the stay will continue till a larger bench adjudicates it and settles the controversy.While Justice Nagarathna held that the decision taken by the committee and govt was vitiated and the impugned approval was in gross violation of principle of public trust, Justice Karol said field testing of DMH-11 with sufficient safeguards and precautions ought to continue and cannot be said to be violative of the precautionary principle.Holding that independent risk assessment should be done indigenously and safety assessment and ecological impact cannot be transplanted from research conducted in a foreign country, Justice Nagarathna said that the constitution of the expert committee in 2022 itself was an eyewash, and the report of the committee was tailor-made in order that GEAC could accord approval.“Wisdom lies in precaution. As the upholder and protector of constitutional wisdom and values, this court has no option but to hold that the decision-making process for grant of approval for the environmental release of DMH-11 has violated the precautionary principle... The failure to adequately assess health and environmental impact of GM crops seriously infringes upon intergenerational equity as it potentially endangers the ability of future citizens to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health,” she said in her judgment.Justice Karol said that the conditional approval was in line with a developmental approach and scientific temper which has been supplemented with conditions imposed by the expert body, to facilitate mitigating measures qua the environment. He emphasised that the use of GM technology had to be seen against backdrop of India being a global agricultural powerhouse and rural India being still largely dependent on agriculture.“The development of scientific temper is to be read with another limb of the DPSPs (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Constitution that is Article 48A and Article 51A(g) respectively which speaks of protection of the environment. As already noticed above, these three parts forming the heart and soul of the Constitution have to be read as a whole and as such any and all considerations of modernising agriculture or building a scientific temper would also be required to necessarily consider and abide by the duty to protect the environment,” he added.",Justices B V Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol took contradictory stands on the validity of the recommendation of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) and the Centre for allowing environmental release of DMH-11 to allow its field trial.

HC seeks Centre's reply on plea against declaring June 25 as Samvidhan Hatya Diwas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-seeks-centres-reply-on-plea-against-declaring-june-25-as-samvidhan-hatya-diwas/articleshow/111968341.cms,"PRAYGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has sought the central government's response to a PIL challenging its recent notification declaring June 25 , the day Emergency was imposed in the country in 1975, as Samvidan Hatya Diwas. The petition filed by Jhansi-based advocate Santosh Singh Dohrey came before a bench comprising Chief Justice Arun Bhansali and Justice Vikas Budhwar on Monday.During the hearing, the counsel representing the Centre sought time to obtain instructions regarding the matter from the government. The court allowed his request and fixed the next hearing on July 31.In the PIL, the petitioner sought quashing of the notification published in the Gazette of India on July 13 this year which declared June 25 as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas', claiming it violates the Constitution.The gazette notification states that a proclamation of Emergency was made on June 25, 1975, following which ""there was gross abuse of power by the then government and people of India were subjected to excesses and atrocities"".""Therefore, the government of India declares 25th June as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas' to pay tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross abuse of power during the period of emergency and to recommit the people of India to not support in any manner such gross abuse of power, in future,"" it said.The PIL plea argues that the notification by the central government directly violates the provision of the Constitution and hits the provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.The PIL contended that the language in the impugned notification is insulting and offending to the Constitution because the parliament, as per section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, has declared whoever whether by word, either spoken or written shows disrespect to the Constitution is an offence.It said that the proclamation of Emergency in 1975 was under the provision of the Constitution. Therefore, the respondents are wrong in declaring June 25th as "" Samvidhan Hatya Diwas "" as the Constitution is a living document ""which can never die nor anybody can be permitted to destroy it.The PIL also questions the rationale behind G Parthasarathi, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, issuing the impugned notification. The plea argues that, as a senior member of the Indian Administrative Services and an executive of India, Parthasarathi is oath-bound to follow the dictates of the Constitution.The plea alleged that he issued the notification to ""please"" his political superiors and to secure his important position in the administration.The PIL contends that all executive actions of the respondent must be expressed in the name of the President of India, as mandated by Article 77 of the Constitution of India.However, the impugned notification does not comply with Article 77, and the rules made thereunder. Therefore, the PIL argues that the notification violates Article 77 of the Constitution.",The Allahabad high court has sought the central government's response to a PIL challenging its recent notification declaring June 25 as Samvidan Hatya Diwas.

Tiwari accused the Centre of ignoring non-BJP-ruled states in the budget, saying, ""We discussed the budget...Wherever there is a non-BJP government, the budget has been blacked out. In the name of development, there is nothing. We will hold a protest tomorrow in the Parliament regarding this. We will raise our voice inside the Parliament also.

""Bengal has been completely deprived… the budget doesn't look into the interest of the poor… it is directionless… it is only to serve a political mission,” she said in Kolkata.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed the Budget has ignored the interests of the youth and farmers. Yadav linked finance minister’s announcements of development measures for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh to BJP's political compulsion to ""save"" its government and asked if there was anything for Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Uttar Pradesh has given the country its prime minister, he added, claiming that the state's farmers have received nothing despite the government's earlier promises of doubling their income.AAP dubbed the Budget as ""jhunjhuna"" (rattle toy) budget saying there was nothing in it for the farmers, youth, women and employees. In a press conference, AAP MPs Sanjay Singh and Malvinder Singh Kang slammed the Budget for ""depriving"" party-ruled Delhi and Punjab of their due shares in the financial allocations. This is ""sarkar bachao, mahangai badhao"" (save government, increase inflation) budget, Singh charged. ""This is a 'jhunjuna' budget in which people did not get anything,"" said Singh.NCP (SP) said the Budget was not for India but for the NDA allies of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. In a post on 'X', NCP (SP) spokesperson Clyde Crasto said Maharashtra was neglected in the Budget, and people of the state will give the BJP a befitting reply in the assembly polls later this year.","Opposition parties have condemned the Union Budget on Tuesday, slamming it for “depriving” states, ruled by the non-NDA parties.

CHENNAI: At least six key roads have been identified by Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for widening by 8 feet to 15 feet to smoothen traffic flow .The selected roads include sections of LB Road in Adyar, New Avadi Road from Kilpauk to Villivakkam, Paper Mills Road from Perambur to Kolathur, Radhakrishnan Salai from Marina Beach to Gemini Circle, Cooks Road, and Perambur Barracks Road from Purasawakkam to Perambur.Mayor R Priya said four roads will be widened using CMDA’s Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) funds, while two roads — Kolathur and Perambur Barracks Road, a long-term proposal — will be funded by GCC. The corporation has initiated negotiations with private property owners for land acquisition.“Widening of North Chennai roads will help to decongest the stretch and work will begin by the year-end,” Priya told TOI.Expansion of LB Road, RK Salai, and Perambur Barracks Road may take longer as they require CMRL to hand over the roads once corridor and station work are completed for corridor 3.Akilandeshwari, assistant executive engineer for zone 6 (Thiru Vi Ka Nagar), said the 3.8-km Paper Mills Road will be widened from 8.5mto 18m. “The widening will happen between 200-feet road and Perambur High Road stretch for a cost of 70 crore,” she said.Similarly, GCC plans to expand Cooks Road soon from 16m to 22m over a length of 240m. “This will be between Cooks Road and Stephenson Road junction, done at a cost of 5.2 crore,” she added.A consultant has been appointed to survey existing road width and determine necessary expansions. The consultant will soon begin work on RK Salai, focusing on properties near Mylapore junction.Murugesan, executive engineer of the bus route roads department, said the current widening efforts will pave the way for future four-lane flyovers. “We are yet to ascertain the width to be widened for RK Salai and LB Road. This work will begin soon after a meeting with CMDA,” he said.Considering the heavy traffic flow in the Nungambakkam subway, GCC is also planning to widen Nelson Manickam Road subway also.","At least six key roads have been identified by Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority for widening by 8 feet to 15 feet to smoothen traffic flow.

Ancient war weapons found in Jagannath Ratna Bhandar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/ancient-war-weapons-found-in-jagannath-ratna-bhandar/articleshow/111870640.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Age-old weapons like swords, spears, and javelins used in past battles were among the items discovered in the Puri Jagannath Temple ’s Ratna Bhandar during the shifting of valuables on Thursday. The Ratna Bhandar, closed for 46 years, was reopened by the Odisha government on July 14 for restoration and inventory.“We found some ancient idols in Ratna Bhandar on July 14.We have now come across a few swords and javelins near a wooden chest within the inner chamber. The weapons were very heavy and had turned black,” said one of the 11 committee members who entered the treasury.Ratna Bhandar supervisory committee chairman Biswanath Rath told journalists that they have “carefully sealed and preserved the battle items in the temporary strongroom.”Rath, a retired Orissa High Court judge, did not divulge details about the weapons, their numbers, or the era to which they belonged.The discovery of the weapons sheds light on the 12th-century CE shrine’s connection to the kings who ruled the region, offering a glimpse into the treasures they accumulated over centuries.Anantavarman Chodaganga Dev of the Eastern Ganga dynasty built the Puri temple in the 1190s, according to sources in the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA). The 214-foot-tall temple is spread over 10.7 acres with 95 subsidiary shrines on its premises.“Jagannath Temple had been invaded and plundered 18 times. For the invaders, the temple was a lucrative source of wealth. To protect the temple, the then kings may have kept the ancient weapons in the Ratna Bhandar,” said Shyama Mahapatra, a temple servitor.According to Jagannath researcher Bhaskar Mishra, “King Kapilendra Deb in 1460 had emerged victorious over another ruler and used 16 elephants to transport a substantial amount of gold to Puri Jagannath Temple.”Historians and heritage researchers have demanded a proper study of the recovered war weapons. They said the government should enlist eminent archaeologists to study the period during which the weapons were in use.“These are very rare materials bearing historical significance . The weapons should be properly preserved and displayed in a museum,” said Sajiv Mishra, a historian.","The Ratna Bhandar, closed for 46 years, was reopened by the Odisha government on July 14 for restoration and inventory.
