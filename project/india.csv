The JDS chief HD Deve Gowda and the Congress state president DK Shivakumar are members of the Vokkaliga community.The third phase is planned for May 7 and will see voting in 94 constituencies across 12 states and union territories.

Vote boycott becomes a cause of concern for parties in Tripura,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-boycott-becomes-a-cause-of-concern-for-parties-in-tripura/articleshow/109658492.cms,"AGARTALA:BJP State President Rajib Bhattacharjee said, “Development is a continuous process and aspersions of the people in ever growing. Even taking part in the election process, the villagers have several options to protest. After all voting is a sacred ritual of a citizen in the democracy.”Senior TIPRA Motha leader and MLA Paul Dangshu said, “It was an unexpected act by the citizens.They were being certainly instigated by a quarter who has failed to perform in 25 years and misguided the innocent people against the nation.”Senior Congress leader and MLA Sudip Roybarman said, “They might be deprived by the government or the party in power not by the country, but boycotting vote is considered as opposing the festival of democracy.”Veteran CPI-M leader and former minister Pabitra Kar opined, “Such incident never happened in the electoral history of Tripura . Road, water and electricity are the fundamental amenities for the citizens, which the government failed to ensure. Although its not a welcoming decision, shows the magnitude of their grievances.”Meanwhile, a noted civil society member and right activist Biswajit Das attributed that even after attaining high litarecy, still voting takes place in India based on symbol, not evaluating the poll manifesto and implementation of the past promises.“It appears that number of voters are gradually declining in India, rather number of cadres and party activists are increasing, which is harbinger a bad omen for democracy.

Did you know that your hospital bill is likely to be heftier – and not less, as many believe – if you are paying for it yourself rather than through an insurance firm? A patient in Gurgaon discovered this to his horror recently and’s enquiries reveal that this is standard practice.When this patient, while being discharged after three days of treatment, decided to pay the bill from his pocket rather than wait for insurance approval, he found that the bill went up by about 27%.The hospital insisted that it was standard practice for the bill to be more if a patient paid directly. Too tired and sick to argue, the patient was forced to pay the higher amount.The 53-year-old patient, who was admitted in Fortis Hospital Gurgaon for suspected food poisoning with fever, severe dehydration and diarrhoea on April 14, was given a twin sharing room, for which he was charged Rs 8,400 per night, similar to the room tariff of a swanky hotel in Gurgaon for a single room, except that here, everything from nursing services, and linen and laundry to admission charges and bio-medical waste disposal was charged separate from the room rent.“They delayed informing my insurance company, though all details including policy number and aadhaar card were given at the time of admission. That delayed the approval process. The doctor informed me on April 16 evening that I would be discharged the next day. I got a message from my insurance company at 8.07 pm on April 16 that they had received the claim. If I was admitted at 9.30 pm on April 14, why did it take them two days to inform the insurance company? We waited the whole day till 7.30 pm on April 17 for insurance approval. Finally, tired of waiting when I offered to pay, they jacked up the bill,” complained the patient. Till April 27 the insurance company had not processed his reimbursement claim.’s enquiries revealed that it was indeed standard practice for hospitals to have discounted rates for insurance companies and higher charges for patients who chose to pay themselves. However, this is not revealed to patients and there is no board put up outside hospitals giving the difference in rates charged to insurance companies and direct patients. In many hospitals, the difference is about 10%. “It is bad enough that there should be a difference in the rates for patients paying directly and for insurance companies. To charge a patient 27% more is plain loot. If anything, the patient paying directly ought to be charged less as the hospital is getting the money right away instead of having to wait for the approval process and so much back and forth with the insurance company asking for several clarifications on the bill. In fact, in many smaller hospitals they charge the patient less if they pay directly,” explained a doctor. Several other doctors thatspoke to echoed his words.According to a TPA representative Anurag Goswami, insurance companies sign MoUs with hospitals to get negotiated rates. “To start with, they are seen as customers not patients. Our customers get the negotiated rates. If the customer goes directly, the amount will vary. We get the discounted rates because we bring them business/customers. These rates vary for different insurance companies. Sometimes, if a customer requests, they might get some discount. In the case of insurance through a bank, if there is any fraud you can complain to the RBI. In the case of an insurance company, you can complain to the IRDAI. If a private hospital does fraud, you cannot go anywhere because they have no governing authority. They know that. That is why they charge individual customers whatever they want,” said Goswami.In response to’s queries, Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon responded: “We initially offered hospital tariffs in accordance with our contractual obligations with Manipal Cigna insurance (Mediassist - TPA) for his hospital stay. However, due to multiple queries and delays in approval from the insurance side, the patient requested to settle the bill and seek reimbursement from the insurance company later. Consequently, as a normal industry-wide practice, standard hospital tariffs were applied, and the contractual discounts with Manipal Cigna were removed, resulting in an increase in the bill amount.”","A patient in Gurgaon discovered this to his horror recently and’s enquiries reveal that this is standard practice. “To charge a patient 27% more is plain loot.

"69% vote in Karnataka Phase-1 for 14 LS seats, Bengaluru limps to 57%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/69-vote-in-karnataka-phase-1-for-14-ls-seats-bengaluru-limps-to-57/articleshow/109639136.cms,"‘Expected city to fare better this time’

BENGALURU: Over 69% of voters in 14 Lok Sabha constituencies of coastal and southern Karnataka turned up to exercise their franchise on Friday, and the provisional voting percentage almost mirrors the figures notched up in the previous two polls: 70.4% in 2019 and 68% in 2014.Bengaluru continued to remain on a sticky wicket with its overall subpar performance of 57%.Mysuru, for the first time, hit the ball out of the park crossing 70% against 69.5% in 2019 and 67.3% in 2014. With this round of polling, the fate of 247 candidates has been sealed, and the remaining 14 seats in central and northern Karnataka will vote on May 7.The seemingly middling turnout in the first phase is yet commendable as voters braved the heat to keep their tryst with the voting exercise. After the final tabulation on the morrow, the overall voting percentage is expected to rise by a couple of percentage of points, helping the figure sail over the psychological 70 mark.Of the four seats, Bangalore Rural reported the best turnout of 67.3% compared to 64.9% in 2019 and Central recor ded 52.8% compared to 54.3% in 2019, while it was 53.1% in South (53.7% in 2019). North had breached the 50% mark by 5pm and ended with 54.4%, compared to 54.8% in 2019.All four seats had seen a dip in turnout compared to 2014, with Bangalore South recording the least.The low turnout in the four-seat Bengaluru cluster is attributable to high temperatures and largely to continuing apathy. The issue of electoral roll inflation also continues to plague Bengaluru.Mandya, which had seen a lot of campaigning action in the run-up to the polling day, emerged on top again, registering 81.5% turnout.In 2019 and 2014 too, the tally had crossed 80% mark, making them the most robust voting constituency in the state.The 14 seats continued to witness the trend of rural voters pulling up the overall voting percentage in Karnataka with Bengaluru’s low proving to be a drag. The lowest polling was recorded in Bangalore Central with just over 52%.In a bid to beat the late forenoon and afternoon heat, voters stood in long queues early in the morning across the state.The voter turnout was the highest between 7am and 11am with 22% and post 3pm when Karnataka saw close to 18% of the total voters casting their ballot.Barring isolated cases of vandalism, missing votes and mismatches in the electoral roll, leading to a few voters being unable to cast their ballot, the state saw peaceful voting across the constituencies.As the day progressed and temperatures soared past 37°C, Bengalureans failed to show much enthusiasm in exercising their franchise.“We expected the city to perform better this time. After multiple consultations and reviews with local authorities, we had identified problematic areas and planned a targeted approach to educate voters and create awareness. Yet, the city did n ot improve on its previous tally,” said a senior official from the Chief Elec toral Office of Karnataka.Political parties, too, were upset about the outcome and blamed stringent measures initiated by the Election Commission for the poor turnout.A candidate from Bangalore Central said: “There are restrictions on holding community engagement events in clubs and marriage halls. We will be charged expenses if a bike or any other rally is held. Given the time constraint, it is difficult to connect with a ll voters through doorto-door campaigns alone.”“More events would have increased awareness among the general public. Digital platforms help in reaching out to one section of society but not all,” the candidate pointed out.","Bengaluru continues to remain on a sticky wicket with its overall subpar performance of 57%.

Is that even possible? Is he doing this out of nervousness,” Priyanka Gandhi responded. She also targeted Modi over inflation, labeling him as a “mehengai” man.Furthermore, in a twist to the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of ""ab ki baar 400 paar,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a rally in Maharashtra, asserted that the public has recognized the theatrics of the current government. She unveiled her own mantra: ""ab ki baar aap ki sarkar, ab ki baar janata ki sarkar"" (this time, a government run by you, a government run by the people).Rahul Gandhi also took aim at Narendra Modi over his claims. ""You have heard the prime minister’s speeches. He is scared. It’s possible that he may shed tears on stage,"" he said on Friday.","Priyanka Gandhi took a jocular stance on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent accusations of "" wealth redistribution "" She likened them to the ramblings of an uncle at weddings.

A level playing field which is a pre requisite for 'free and fair elections' has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of the Petitioner,"" Kejriwal told the Supreme Court.""The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central government has misused the central agency- Enforcement Directorate and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent -Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders. The corresponding paras of SLP are reiterated and relied upon herein and not repeated for the sake of brevity,"" he added.Delhi chief minister also claimed that the central agency has no proof or material demonstrating that theAam Aadmi Party has received advanced kickbacks from the South lobby, let alone utilizing them in the Goa election campaign.“Not a single rupee was traced back to the AAP, and the allegations put forth in this regard are devoid of any tangible evidence, rendering them vague, baseless without any corroboration,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal's response comes days after the Enforcement Director filed an affidavit in the Delhi Excise policy case and claimed that Delhi chief minister played a central role in the excise policy case, acting as the ""kingpin and key conspirator."" The probe agency asserted that arresting an individual based on evidence of an offense does not undermine the principles of free and fair elections.According to the ED , Kejriwal allegedly collaborated with his ministers and AAP leaders, and was involved in ""demanding kickbacks"" from liquor businessmen in return for favors granted through the policy.Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.On April 9, the Delhi high court upheld Kejriwal's arrest, citing his repeated non-compliance with central agency's summons as a compelling factor necessitating his arrest.","Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday filed his response on the Enforcement Directorate's affidavit in the Supreme Court.

Thakur asked people to decide whether they want to keep their property or give it to Muslims.This criticism comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders accused the Congress of planning to take away people's wealth and give it to Muslims. The PM claimed that the Congress-led government in the past had said that Muslims should get the first share of the country's resources. These remarks have caused a lot of controversy, with some people criticizing the PM for using negative terms for Muslims and others criticizing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his alleged statements.Thakur further added, ""The 'Tukde-tukde' gang has surrounded Congress completely and has hijacked their ideology... You have to decide whether you want to go with Congress' 'Tukde-tukde' gang or Narendra Modi who believes in 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat'. You have to decide whether the children's property should remain with them or should it go to Muslims. We gave all rights to Muslims, equally... But we did not give it based on religion, we gave it because it was their right... When Rajiv Gandhi became the PM, there was a law that 55% of property would go to the government, but he abolished this law and saved his property. Now, Rahul Gandhi did not get married so he wants to take away your children's property.

Nadda also accused the Congress of having a biased approach and claimed that their election promises favored Muslims, which the PM likened to the policies of the Muslim League.Thakur and Nadda's comments came after the Election Commission sent notices to both the BJP and the Congress based on complaints about their leaders' speeches. The notices warned both parties to maintain a higher standard of discussion during election campaigns and to avoid making statements that could create division.",The BJP has started tightening its grip around Congress's manifesto.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on BJP-led NDA govt over inflation and unemployment during a campaign rally for Lok Sabha elections in Dharampur of Gujarat’s Valsad district on Saturday. She alleged that BJP would alter the Constitution if it came to office for a third time. “Many BJP functionaries are saying they will change the Constitution.But Modiji is denying it. First, they will always deny what they want to do. But after coming to office, they will implement it. They want to change the Constitution to weaken the common people and deprive them of their rights,” Priyanka said.Priyanka referred to PM Modi as “mehengai man”. “Modiji is portrayed as a big leader. On the other hand, see how people are struggling. People are unemployed, and the unemployment rate is the highest ever in the country,” she said.She said Modi is portrayed as an able leader, but people are unemployed and the unemployment rate is the highest ever in the country. “People fear telling him anything. The PM is so arrogant, no one can tell him anything. How would he know what problems people are facing? When I was young, I used to be with Indiraji and Rajivji. People of Amethi would scold them for roads, but they did not take offence. They were assured of roads,” she said.Priyanka praised former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, referring to him as a “sabhya insaan” (civilised person).She criticised BJP govt’s handling of women’s security and its response to protests by Olympic medallists as well as Hathras and Unnao gang rapes.Regarding electoral bonds, she alleged: “They came up with a scheme of political donation. The BJP raided many people and took funds. They have accepted funds from those involved in the bridge collapse, from the makers of corona vaccine.”Priyanka highlighted Congress’s manifesto, which addresses issues faced by the tribal population. The party will bring an MGNREGA-like scheme for urban areas where families will get 100 days of guaranteed work, she said.She also outlined Congress’s agenda, including filling approximately 30 lakh vacancies in govt jobs, providing subsidised diesel to fishermen, increasing the minimum wage to Rs 400, and implementing “sub-plans” for STs and SCs.

26/11 prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam gets BJP ticket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-prosecutor-ujjwal-nikam-gets-bjp-ticket/articleshow/109654813.cms,"TOI

New Delhi: BJP has fielded 26/11 prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam as its candidate from Mumbai North Central seat, dropping two-term incumbent Poonam Mahajan from the contest.Nikam, a prominent presence on prime time TV during the trial of Ajmal Kasab, the sole survivor among the Lashkar gang who went on a rampage killing innocents, as well as during the trial of the accused in the 1993 serial blasts, is expected to be a good fit for BJP’s “tough-on-terrorism” plank.He has come in place of the daughter of late BJP leader stalwart Pramod Mahajan.“We can serve society and the country through politics. I have received this opportunity to serve the nation. Therefore, I consider myself lucky,” said Nikam after being named as BJP’s candidate., in its edition of April 23, had reported the BJP leadership’s plan to drop Poonam and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, the incumbent at Ladakh, who has been substituted by Tashi Gyalson.With this, the spotlight has turned on the party leadership’s plans for Kaiserganj seat in UP, amid indications that the party is considering replacing sitting MP Brij Bhushan Singh, who is accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers, with his wife Ketki Singh.Poonam’s axing is also seen as symbolising the leadership’s twin messages of “party comes first” and “nobody is indispensable”. Though relatively young, she was twice fielded from Mumbai North Central, seen as a tribute to the contribution made by her father Pramod Mahajan. Poonam was also made the chief of the party’s youth wing. While her career seemed to be on the rise, indications of the leadership souring on her surfaced soon because of what sources described as “intensity deficit”. Sources said that she was not able to fulfill the BJP leadership’s expectations.Poonam, in her first reaction after being replaced, took the decision gracefully and thanked the BJP leadership for allowing her to represent the constituency for 10 years.“I will always be indebted to the family-like people of the area for loving me not only as an MP but also like a daughter, and I hope that this relationship will always remain. My role model, my father Late Pramod Mahajan Ji showed me the path of ‘Nation first, then us’. I pray to God that I can follow the same path throughout my life,” she said in a post on X.The fate of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh hangs in the balance as his chances of being a BJP nominee have further diminished after a Delhi court on Friday rejected a plea filed by him seeking directions to Delhi Police to further investigate the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him by women wrestlers.The court said it will pronounce an order on the framing of charges on May 7 — the last date of filing of nominations is May 3.There are speculations that Namgyal was dropped in favour of Gyalson to calm the tension in Ladakh over demands for statehood and inclusion in Sixth Schedule.",Ujjwal Nikam is expected to be a good fit for BJP’s “tough-on-terrorism’ plank. He has come in place of the daughter of late BJP leader stalwart Pramod Mahajan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109654815,imgsize-812920,width-400,resizemode-4/109654815.jpg"

"Arrest illegal and arbitrary, ED acting with malice: CM Kejriwal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arrest-illegal-and-arbitrary-ed-acting-with-malice-cm-kejriwal/articleshow/109654679.cms,":

CM in a letter says

NEW DELHIAccusing the Centre of “misusing” Enforcement Directorate to “crush” its political opponents ahead of the parliamentary elections, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has told Supreme Court that his arrest was illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on free and fair elections and federalism.Countering the allegations of the agency that he was the “kingpin” of the alleged excise policy scam, CM said ED was acting with “malicious intent” against him in a gross affront to due process of law and there was no evidence of money laundering against him and his party, AAP.He said that the case was registered almost two years ago but the agency decided to act against him only after election dates were announced to give an “unjust upper hand” to central govt in the elections.Kejriwal, in his affidavit filed in the apex court, said, “The mode, manner and timing of the arrest of the petitioner just before the Lok Sabha elections , when the schedule had been announced and the model code of conduct had come into play, speaks volumes about the arbitrariness of ED. This timeline establishes the fact that the petitioner has been arrested intentionally with mala fide intent without any necessity to arrest.”Responding to the allegation that he misused his office and demanded a bribe, the CM said, “The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central govt has misused the central agency, ED, and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent, Aam Aadmi Party, and its leaders.”He told the apex court that the ED’s statement that he defied summons is a “blatant falsehood” as each summons had been duly responded to by raising pertinent issues which have not been responded to and the probe agency has maintained an “eerie silence”.“There is also an issue of the ED abusing its power of arrest in the middle of the general elections and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before its arrest. In such circumstances, the case of the petitioner is peculiar and grave and warrants urgent intervention of this court to protect life and liberty of an individual...The petitioner’s arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on ‘free and fair elections’ and ‘federalism’, both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of Constitution,” he said.“The central govt agency illegally ‘picked up’ a sitting chief minister and the national convenor of one of the six national opposition parties in India just five days after the general elections were called and the model code of conduct was put in place. The petitioner’s political party is in direct opposition to the ruling political party at the Centre in the on-going elections. During an election cycle when political activity is at its highest, his illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to his political party and will provide the ruling party at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections,” he said.Kejriwal argued that “the entire basis of the petitioner’s arrest rests upon certain statements which are in the nature of self-incriminating confessions by alleged accomplices who have been given immunity by way of pardon etc. These alleged incriminating evidences, therefore, were obtained under an arrangement without any corroborative evidence.”In this context, he recalled the chain of events involving Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, P Sarath Reddy and Satya Vijay Naik. He accused ED of suppressing certain statements. “It is a settled law by this Hon’ble Court that it is the investigating officer’s duty to ‘unearth the truth’ but not to prosecute the accused person by cherry picking a few statements here and there…This approach would clearly reveal that ED proceeds on the basis that it has a right to conceal documents which are in favour of the accused from the court and the accused. This negates the very principle of fair trial and fair investigation.”Dealing with the allegation of cash payments to an AAP candidate in the Goa elections, the affidavit says, “There exists no proof or material demonstrating that AAP received funds or advanced kickbacks from the South group, let alone utilizing them in the Goa election campaign. Not a single rupee was traced back to AAP and the allegations put forth in the regard are devoid of any tangible evidence, rendering them vague and baseless without any corroboration.”Responding to the allegation of “large-scale destruction of evidence” as a ground for his arrest, Kejriwal said there is not a single averment alleging destruction of evidence of any kind by him and hence the ground cited was devoid of any merit.The present case is a classic case of how the ruling party-led central govt has misused the central agency, ED, and its wide powers under PMLA to crush its biggest political opponent, Aam Aadmi Party, and its leaders","Arvind Kejriwal has told Supreme Court that his arrest was illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy. He said ED was acting with “malicious intent” against him in a gross affront to due process of law and there was no evidence of money laundering against him and his party, AAP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109654686,imgsize-1277445,width-400,resizemode-4/109654686.jpg"

It’s Congress that wants to change Constitution: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-congress-that-wants-to-change-constitution-pm-modi/articleshow/109654630.cms,"KOLHAPUR/VASCO: PM Modi alleged at a campaign rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, on Saturday that Congress wants to extend the “Karnataka model” of offering reservation to all Muslims in the country by “planning a dacoity on 27% OBC quota”, and that it “plans to change the Constitution for this appeasement”.Later, addressing a rally in Sancoale, South Goa, Modi said “the Constitution holds no significance” for Congress.“With the kind of clarification given by Congress candidate (Viriato Fernandes for South Goa), Congress’s hidden agenda has been exposed… And this isn’t a singular instance, they have talked of disintegrating the country earlier, too,” Modi said.In Goa, he reiterated his allegations of the last few days that Congress wants to impose a 55% inheritance tax . “The mystery of Congress’s shehzada has been unravelled. He has brought an X-ray machine from abroad by which he intends to assess your wealth and redistribute it among its vote bank,” he said. “And you know who their vote bank is,” he added. “If a fisherman wants to bequeath two of his boats to his son, he will be able to give only one.”In Kolhapur, Modi also claimed INDIA bloc partners are dreaming of forming govt and planning to share the PM’s post amongst themselves. “One year, one PM is their plan… But such formulas will not work,” he said.Modi said Congress and the INDIA bloc have their eyes set on wealth earned by common people, including the jewellery of women. “Congress’s Shehzada is going to bring inheritance tax through which 50% of the wealth earned by you will be recovered. Your wealth will be distributed to those whom they had once said have the first right over India’s wealth,” Modi said.He also accused Congress and DMK of trying to create narratives to divide the country and alleged that state govts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are openly talking about carving out a separate nation for southern states. “‘Ahad (from) Tanjavar, Tahad (to) Peshawar is our land’ was Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s slogan for achieving the goal of Hindavi Swarajya. Will you (Kolhapur residents) support Congress’s agenda to divide the country,” Modi asked.Modi claimed Congress was unable to compete with BJP ’s track record of development and hence started using “anti-national and appeasement planks” in poll campaigns. “Are they (Congress) aware what their situation will be if they dare revoke CAA?” Modi said.“DMK leaders called Sanatan Dharma dengue and malaria. I was surprised when an INDIA bloc partner invited DMK leaders in Maharashtra and felicitated them. Nakli (fake) Shiv Sena is walking shoulder-to-shoulder with those who praised Aurangzeb. Balasaheb Thackeray’s aatma (soul) would certainly be unhappy over his (Uddhav Thackeray’s) deeds,” said Modi.Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis, and RPI leader Ramdas Athawale also addressed the rally.In Goa, the PM referred to his special “relation” with the state. “Whatever I am today, every turning point of my life has been in Goa. The decision of my party to make me PM was taken in Goa. My fate is written in Goa. This is why I say that I need two strong colleagues in Parliament…” Modi said.Modi’s connection to Goa dates back to April 2002. At the BJP executive committee meeting in the aftermath of the post-Godhra riots, Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, overcame stiff opposition, first from party members and then from PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to retain his post with the support of national executive members.","Modi claims Congress wants to extend the “Karnataka model’ of offering reservation to all Muslims in the country by “planning a dacoity on 27% OBC quota” “If a fisherman wants to bequeath two of his boats to his son, he will be able to give only one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109654638,imgsize-1226246,width-400,resizemode-4/109654638.jpg"
