Trinamool Congress looks to maintain dream run in its Kolkata South bastion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-congress-looks-to-maintain-dream-run-in-its-kolkata-south-bastion/articleshow/110547828.cms,"KOLKATA: If one were to identify one seat out of the 42 in West Bengal as a bastion of Trinamool Congress , it would undoubtedly be Kolkata South that Mamata Banerjee and then her party colleagues (after she stepped down in 2011 and contested as an MLA to become CM) have held for 33 years.Kolkata South also stands out for its distinct political landscape where out of the seven assembly segments, winners in five were state cabinet members until July 2022 when one of them — Partha Chatterjee who won from Behala West — was arrested for his alleged involvement in a teaching job scam.First as a Youth Congress functionary and then as Trinamool Congress founder, Mamata had won the seat for six consecutive terms from 1991 before passing on the baton to Subrata Bakshi who won in 2011 (byelection) and then in 2014. Mala Roy, who won in 2019 is defending the seat this time. What tilts the scales further in TMC’s favour is the significant 28% Muslim voters in the constituency who are expected to stay loyal to the party.“With due respect to my opposition candidates, I’m 200% confident of winning,” said Roy. “Not just because of our solid presence and base in this constituency but also because of my own track record here. My work speaks for itself. After Sougata Roy, I have asked the most questions in Parlia ment among Bengal MPs. Opposition parties are trying to malign us. They are even using multiple agencies to harass our functionaries. But the more they do so, the worse they will fare in this elections,” said Roy, who is also a local councillor and chairperson of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.In 2019, Roy had trounced her nearest competitor, BJP ’s Chandra Kumar Bose, by more than 1.6 lakh votes. The latter, grandnephew of Subhas Chandra Bose, is no longer in the party.Roy has a star-studded support team in the constituency. CM Banerjee is herself the Bhowanipore MLA. Urban development minister and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim represents Kolkata Port. Javed Ahmed Khan from Kasba is the disaster management minister and Babul Supriyo from Ballygunge is the head of non-conventional and renewable energy sources ministry. Then there is Debasis Kumar from Rasbehari who is the KMC’s mayoral council member (parks and square). Ratna Chatterjee from Behala Purba, the estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, is another influential functionary.With such heavyweight presence alongside many minority voters in the 18.5 lakh-strong electorate, political observers and analysts believe it is a nocontest in three assembly segments: Kolkata Port, Ballygunge and Kasba. And that, they believe, is enough to win the Kolkata South seat yet again.BJP has fielded Debasree Chaudhuri, the outgoing Lok Sabha member from Raiganj Parliamentary constituency in North Dinajpur district, against Roy. While many termed Chaudhuri’s ejection from her stronghold Raiganj to the comparatively lesser-known turf of Kolkata South as more of an exile, the former Union junior minister for woman and child development views it as an opportunity to prove her worth in Trinamool’s strongest seat.“It’s a TMC stronghold alright but one that is built on lies and corruption and my job is to breach the fortress. That is the reason why the party brass has chosen me to contest from this seat. Among the five ministers in this constituency, one is in jail, and some are on bail. It tells you a lot about the party,” said Chaudhuri.Though BJP has never won the seat, the first MP to be elected in 1952 from the constituency — then known as Calcutta South-East — was Syama Prasad Mookerjee, founder of BJP’s predecessor Bharatiya Jana Sangh.Also in the fray is CPM’s Saira Shah Halim, the daughter-in-law of Bengal’s longest-serving speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and niece of actor Naseeruddin Shah and daughter of former deputy chief of Army staff, Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah.A relative newcomer to politics, Saira has been praised for her role in rejuvenating the CPM’s prospects in the closely contested Ballygunge assembly bypoll in 2022. She surprised many by finishing second ahead of BJP’s Keya Ghosh. Although Saira lost to Trinamool’s Babul Supriyo by 20,000 votes, her performance resulted in a significant 24% increase in her party’s vote share.However, Kolkata South is a different ballgame. The Left has won the seat only three times in the past: 1967, 1980 and 1989. But Saira says she is not daunted by the task at hand.“BJP is tinkering with the Constitution and Trinamool is full of corruption. People here are fed up with them and need an honest representative. People have seen how red volunteers have worked during Covid and showered their faith upon me in the 2022 bypoll. This cosmopolitan constituency needs a progressive and educative face and there is none better than me,” said the writer, activist and educator who was a business development and communications trainer with the West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd before she took the political plunge.","Mala Roy, who won in 2019 is defending the seat this time.

Poll Issues

Vote For Development

Modi & Yogi Factor

GORAKHPUR: Old-timers recall that after the construction of Vikas Bhawan in the late 80s, there was no development work worth its name that had reached Gorakhpur for over three decades. However, the elevation of its five-time MP Yogi Adityanath to the post of UP’s chief minister saw a turnaround. Now, the city is known for a new AIIMS , fertilizer plant, Ramgarh Taal and a zoological garden.Once infamous for mafia and mosquitoes, Gorakhpur has projects of Rs 40,000 crore in various stages of completion.In the late ’90s, the district had earned the sobriquet of ‘Chicago of the East’ due to the battle for supremacy between dons like Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. The district also witnessed the sudden rise of gangsters like Sriprakash Shukla and other criminals.During the last decade, especially in the last seven years of Yogi govt, a massive dip in crime rate has been reported and the district underwent a transformation with a host of development projects .Moreover, Gorakhpur, which used to be the epicentre of encephalitis which claimed the lives of hundreds of children every year, got rid of the epidemic with the help of a targeted strategy by the Yogi govt. “As an MP, he had relentlessly campaigned for the eradication of this disease, but his efforts didn’t bring desired results due to ‘unfriendly’ govts at Centre and in the state,” says S K Tripathi, a teacher.Residents say new roads, uninterrupted power supply and end of mosquito menace through fogging are like a “dream come true”. This time, election issues include employment, tap water supply to every household and crop losses due to stray cattle menace.Gorakhpur is home to Goraksh Peeth, established by Nath sect founder Guru Gorakhnath. Nath has been involved in political activities since the pre-independence era and remains an axis of power in UP till date. Its chief priest Mahant Digvijay Nath joined Congress in 1921 and was arrested for taking an “active part” in the Chauri Chaura incident. He joined Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. He spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of 1949 at the end of which idols of Lord Ram appeared inside Babri Masjid. He was elected Gorakhpur MP in 1967.His successor, Mahant Avaidyanath, was elected MLA as an independent in 1962, 1967, 1969, 1974 and 1977, and an MP from Gorakhpur in 1970 and 1989. During the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, he joined BJP and got elected as Gorakhpur MP in 1991 and 1996.Avaidyanath’s successor Yogi Adityanath remained Gorakhpur MP for five terms from 1998 to 2017, when he vacated the seat to take over as Uttar Pradesh CM.This time, the constituency is witnessing a fight between Bhojpuri actor-turned politician Ravi Kishan of BJP and Bhojpuri actress Kajal Nishad of SP.In the 2019 LS polls too, BJP had fielded Kishan who defeated SP’s Rambhual Nishad by over 3 lakh votes. SP is eyeing Nishad and Yadav-Muslim votes by field ing Kajal Nishad. Goraknath Temple, where Yogi is still the chief priest, continues to be a centre of attraction for all.Gorakhpur constituency comprises five assembly segments — Campierganj, Pipraich, Gorakhpur Urban, Gorakhpur Rural and Sahjanwa – and covers the entire Gorakhpur district. There are around nine lakh OBC and six lakh upper caste voters out of which around 3.5 lakh are Nishads and 2.4 lakh Yadavs. There are 2.5 lakh Dalits and two lakh Muslims. The dominance of the riverine community of Nishads and their associated sub-castes plays a key role in poll outcome. That’s where SP’s Kajal claims her edge.Vishnu Kumar, a shopkeeper, says, “Campierganj has seen development, be it roads or lights. People will vote for development and not on caste lines,” he says.Rajkumar Nishad, a farmer from Sahjanwa, says: “I will vote for our own candidate. If BJP wins, then it will be due to Baba’s (CM Yogi’s) charisma.” Farmers in Machhligaon, Algarpur, are upset with stray cattle menace and water crisis and say they would support the party which promises relief from these two problems.Susheela Gaud, who is busy preparing tea and ‘jalebis’ at a tea stall at Bismipul in Campierganj, says: “People are facing water crisis and are dependent on hand pumps which are not in a good condition.”According to farm labourers Ashok Yadav, Santosh Kumar, and Raju Nishad from Lakshmipur and Algarpur villages in Campierganj, the govt has advised people to consume piped water only as there is arsenic contamination in water. They, however, say water supply is not sufficient. A group of jute mill workers and farmers sitting at a shop near Sahjanwa railway station say the station lacks public toilets and drinking water facility.“We get electricity and roads are also good. Development is taking place here,” says Susheela in Machhaligan village of Campierganj. A shop owner in Gol Ghar says that in the last few years, power supply has improved, and roads have been widened. “Sahjanwa is not developed like other parts of Gorakhpur, but it has firstclass roads and power supply,” says Umesh Yadav, a worker in a jute mill.A group of homemakers in Gol Bazar said: “I live near Nauka Vihar and have come here for household shopping at 7pm. This is something women in Gorakhpur couldn’t think of a few years ago as chain snatching, eve-teasing and harassment were common. Now, we freely use public transport and can come out for work even late at night,” says Anubhuti Jaiswal.New hotels, roads, sugar mills, fertilizer factories and improvement in law and order are drawing appreciation from people. “Once dead bodies used to float in Ramgarh Taal. Now, it has crystal clear water, and the cruise service has given the city a new look. Here people will vote for development and not for caste,” says Akash Yadav, who lives in Pipraich and works in a private hotel in Gorakhpur.","Once infamous for mafia and mosquitoes, Gorakhpur has projects of Rs 40,000 crore in various stages of completion.

BJP Loses An Ally, Cong Gains One

Changing Voter Base

CHANDIGARH: It’s once again a one-onone fight between BJP and Congress for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha constituency as has been the case in most of the elections since the city’s first parliamentary polls in 1967.The difference this time though is that it is not just a battle between two parties, but the culmination of more than a decade-long wait for the two main contenders — BJP’s Sanjay Tandon and Congress’s Manish Tewari .For two-time MP and former Union minister Tewari, 58, it is a homecoming he has been waiting for since 2009 polls. Born and raised in the city, Tewari learnt his first political lessons here. But since 1991, Congress brass kept its faith in its veteran functionary Pawan Kumar Bansal , who maintained a tight hold and resisted any new entrant in the city’s political landscape.Bansal won four of the eight elections he contested in, including three wins on the trot in 1999, 2004 and 2009. In the last two Lok Sabha polls, he suffered major defeats at the hands of BJP’s actorturned-politician Kirron Kher , who has also grown up in the city.For BJP’s Tandon, 60, the wait for nomination has been long and bitter. In 2014, he was the lead contender, but the party’s national leadership sprang a surprise by declaring Kher as candidate.There were internal squabbles and protests, but Tandon, the Chandigarh BJP state president at the time, went along with the party’s decision. Riding the Modi wave, Kher won easily in 2014 and 2019 elections. But relations between Tandon and Kher have remained cold if not bitter. This time, with Kher struggling with health issues and anti-incumbency at its peak, the party finally decided to repose its faith in Tandon.Within the overarching campaign narratives of ‘democracy in danger’ vs ‘10 years of vikas’, the Chandigarh campaign is also driven by the personality and background of the two candidates.Tewari, son of a noted educationist, poet and a former Rajya Sabha member V N Tewari, is a full-bred Congressman, having risen through the ranks — president of National Students Union of India from 1986 to 1993 and president of Indian Youth Congress from 1998 to 2003.On the other end, Tandon’s roots run deep in BJP and Sangh Parivar. His father, Balram Das Tandon, was an RSS pracharak and founding member of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1951. Tandon learnt his first ideological lessons in the Sangh’s shakhas. His first major political responsibility was in 1991 when he was put in charge of the party’s Lok Sabha campaign. Despite being overlooked by BJP for the Chandigarh ticket, Tandon continued to work at the grassroot level building close relationships within the cadre and also with major stake holders and interest groups across the city.With Kher accused of being inaccessible and not on good terms with the Chandigarh administration, particularly in the last five years, party workers and residents have turned to Tandon. He has become the link between residents and administration. After Tewari was chosen Congress candidate, Tandon was quick to flaunt his wellcultivated connection, and labelled his rival an “outsider”. BJP also termed Tewari as a “bhagora” (runaway) for frequently changing his constituencies. “Where are you running off to in 2029?” is a rhetoric raised by Tandon in his campaigns.Tewari was Congress MP from Ludhiana in 2009, didn’t contest 2014 elections, and in 2019 was elected from Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib seat. However, Tewari’s poll pitch is that even though he was representing other constituencies, he still lives in Chandigarh and has funded several projects in the city through his MPLAD funds and raised issues related to the city in Parliament. His supporters are also quick to remind, “He is a son of the soil. His father was killed in Chandigarh by terrorists (in 1984).” Tewari has also raked up Tandon’s connection with disgraced BJP-nominated councillor Anil Masih, who was castigated by Supreme Court for his role in denying INDIA bloc victory in Chandigarh mayoral elections. Attacking Tandon, Tewari has said, “A vote for Tandon is a vote for Masih.”For the first time, Congress is contesting Chandigarh elections in alliance with AAP. In 2014, AAP had dented Congress’ vote share by garnering nearly 24% of the total votes polled. Congress’ vote share shrank by 20% from 2009. In 2019, AAP got only 4% of votes. Congress recovered around 13% of the lost vote share.BJP and its long-time ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, have parted ways this elections. Akalis, who hardly have a base in the constituency, had nominated their Chandigarh MC councillor Hardeep Singh as candidate but he gave up his ticket and quit the party, claiming no Akali leader was supporting him. He later joined AAP. BJP also suffered its first electoral setback in a decade in Chandigarh in the 2021 municipal corporation elections. AAP became the single largest party, followed by BJP and Congress, a development that may help Tewari.Rehabilitation colonies and villages, with nearly half of the city’s 6.6 lakh voters, are key to victory. They also have a higher propensity to get out and vote than those living in the sectorial grid. Migrants from Bihar and UP make up a major chunk of colonies and village voters. Issues like village and colony infrastructural development, regularisation of constructions outside lal dora, relief for building violations, traffic congestion, parking woes and ownership rights have consequently gained primacy in this election. And both candidates are on the same page regarding these issues.","BJP's Sanjay Tandon and Congress’s Manish Tewari are the two main contenders.

"As PM Modi takes ‘poll position’, battle boils down to win margin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-pm-modi-takes-poll-position-battle-boils-down-to-win-margin/articleshow/110547634.cms,"Nothing seems to be more in focus for Prime Minister Narendra Modi except the numbers in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi, which is one among those few seats where BJP requires least effort to ensure victory.Even the fiercest of the critics of the PM, who claim that there is only “cosmetic development” in some places and the much-needed works off the main roads have been neglected, believe that there is no contest as there is no match to PM Modi’s stature.The BJP, therefore, has shifted its focus on improving the tally of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. For this, a battery of top BJP functionaries, Union ministers, chief ministers, deputy chief ministers, MPs and MLAs have camped in Varanasi to boost the numbers.In 2019, the PM had a comfortable victory by a margin of around 4.79 lakh votes. He secured 6.74 lakh votes which was around 63% of the total votes polled. Samajwadi Party ’s Shalini Yadav, who has now joined the BJP, then got 1.95 lakh votes, while Congress’s Ajay Rai garnered 1.52 lakh votes.Total voter turnout in 2019 stood at 59.2%, which means that out of 17.84 lakh voters, 10.56 lakh stepped out to vote. In the last general elections Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party were in alliance while Congress contested alone. This time, Samajwadi Party and Congress have joined hands while the BSP has decided to go solo.Ajay Rai of the Congress is the INDIA bloc candidate while Athar Jamal Lari is contesting on BSP ticket. A month before the election, the BJP deployed its national general secretary Sunil Bansal to boost the morale of the cadre and make efforts to improve voting percentage and victory margin.According to party sources, he started off by convincing and cajoling those who were unhappy with the present party functionaries for some reason. During the roadshow of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day before the filing of nomination, almost all the prominent BJP workers of Varanasi were present.Thereafter, to promote a feeling of belongingness, the party focused on personalizing the election campaign. As part of the strategy, BJP functionaries visited a total of 2,005 intellectuals, awardees of Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and celebrities from Varanasi and handed them a personal letter from the Prime Minister urging them to vote and encourage others to do so.Under the guidance of Bansal, BJP is also handing over personalized letters to first-time voters of Varanasi. Out of the total 1.26 lakh identified voters, around 90,000 have been chosen for personalized letters.Each letter will have the name of the first-time voter and will be handed over to them by BJP workers. The exercise to distribute the letters has already begun and the target will be met by May 30. The letter is a request to the first-time voters to participate in the festival of democracy on June 1. “The idea behind this exercise is to ensure at least 60% voting this time so that the victory margin of the PM crosses at least 5 lakh mark if not more,” a BJP functionary said. INDIA bloc candidate, Ajay Rai, is relying on his supporters’ votes as he has been five-time MLA from Kolasla and then Pindra. He is also looking forward to getting support from Muslim and Yadav voters to challenge Modi.Athar Jamal Lari of the BSP is focusing on division among Muslim votes along with traditional Dalit votes loyal to BSP president Mayawati. Observers believe that the battle in Kashi is more about improving statistics rather than focusing on victory or defeat.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency of Varanasi is one among those few seats where BJP requires least effort to ensure victory.

Caste matrix

Urban voters

The dry land of Mirzapur is eagerly waiting for rains to get relief from the scorching heat. Same is the situation on its poll turf where water could be the deciding factor. Situated on the banks of the Ganga river, shortage of potable and non-potable water is the main election issue in the district which has shot to fame thanks to the popular OTT series ‘Mirzapur’.The primary source of irrigation for cultivation of crops in more than three dozen villages of Marihaan sub-division of Mirzapur, the sluice gates to provide water to the canal were lifted last time in 2022 Rabi season. The starting point of the canal has now dried up and algae has covered its bed.Baba Yadav, a local resident and a worker of Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction, shares the plight of villagers: “For the past two years we have been struggling in every cropping season as no water comes from the canal. In remote areas of Mirzapur, every family depends on agriculture for livelihood. Ahead of the paddy cultivation in Jan and Feb, power supply was also irregular because of which borewells could not be operated.” Yadav adds that he has been unable to convey these concerns to the party leadership due to lack of access.Mirzapur is among the driest regions of the state and its farmers rely heavily on the monsoon-fed dams and reservoirs for agriculture. Presence of red sandstone and rock terrains make drilling of borewells difficult unlike other parts of the state.Mirzapur is known for not giving more than two consecutive turns to an MP. Apna Dal (Sonelal) candidate Anupriya Patel is aiming to break the jinx this time, but it’s a tough fight for her on the seat she has been representing since 2014. Anupriya, 43, is having a face-off with BJP turncoat and sitting MP from neighbouring Bhadohi, Ramesh Chand Bind , 50, who has entered the fray in Mirzapur on SP ticket after being denied the ticket in his constituency.Mirzapur comprises five assembly segments of Chhanbey, Mirzapur, Majhawan, Chunar and Marihaan. While the gun-toting mafia like ‘ Kaleen Bhaiya ’ are limited to reel life, the real-life kaleen (carpet) traders are keen for an MP who can address their business concerns. Rajesh Kumar, vice-president of All India Carpet Manufacturers’ Association, says: “The one district one product scheme has certainly created a brand value for Bhadohi-Mirzapur carpets but the industry is not getting the support it needs. The incentives have been rolled back or withdrawn while additional compliances and regulations that have been introduced in the recent years have impacted the business.”Ramesh Bind has an uphill task to consolidate voters beyond Muslims, Yadavs and Binds (the three communities account for 4-5 lakh votes). Bind has also been mired in controversies for making inappropriate remarks against upper castes and it’s being raked up against him in the polls. Bind, though, has deep roots in politics. He was BSP MLA from Majhawan for three consecutive terms (2002, 2007 and 2012) on a seat dominated by Binds, Dalits and Brahmins.Caste factor, too, is in the play. Scheduled Caste voters can be the decider for any party. BSP has fielded Manish Kumar Tripathi and Mayawati even addressed a rally in his support on May 23. SCs account for 26% of the population (about 5 lakh voters out of 19.06 lakh electors) and half of them are Jatavs, the old loyalists of BSP. Mirzapur also has a higher population of Kol voters compared to Pasi.OBCs, particularly Patels, constitute the largest chunk in the district and are expected to stand behind Anupriya firmly for the third time. Rajesh Patel, a businessman in Rajgarh development block of Chunar, says, “I will support Anupriya because she is our community leader and a minister. Her margin may drop but she will sail through.” Patel, however, adds that “No steps were taken when we needed water and power for our crops in Jan and Feb. Water crisis is perennial and we hope Anupriya will find a permanent solution in her third term.”Backing Ramesh Bind, Mithlesh Prajapati from Danti village of Majhawan says, “Bulldozers were used to bring down houses of 40 rural families in Danti in Jan last year. Nobody paid heed to our pleas and it is time to teach a lesson to the local MLA and MP.” Local administration had identified the land in Danti for setting up a university and razed the houses to clear up the land. However later on the project was shifted to Deori Kalan.Urban voters in Mirzapur say work on the upcoming Vindhyavasini shrine corridor, proposed investment projects and improved connectivity through national highways might go in favour of the BJP-Apna Dal (S) alliance. Shyam Kumar Dubey, who runs a battery shop near Mirzapur railway station, says, “You should have seen the railway station earlier to realise what has changed. The only issue which I can recollect was frequent closure of the Lal Bahadur Shastri bridge (pucca pul) over the Ganga during the past three years for repair works. However we would soon get six-lane connectivity as Yogi Adityanath has made the announcement and provided the budget for its construction.”","Mirzapur is known for not giving more than two consecutive turns to an MP.

slave mentality

NEW DELHI: Accusing Congress of ignoring Mahatma Gandhi , PM Modi has said the icon remained unknown to the world till the 1982 film 'Gandhi' was made, inviting swift retaliation from Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge who said ""those whose ideological ancestors along with Nathuram Godse were involved in the assassination of Bapu can never follow the path of truth shown by him"".Replying to a question on whether opposition didn't do enough to promote India's cultural heritage and pilgrimage sites when in office at the Centre, Modi said, ""The question is not just about (that)... Gandhi was a tall personality... In the past 75 years, was it not our responsibility to let the world know about him? No one knew (of him).""When the film ('Gandhi') was made, it attracted global interest. We have not done this (the film was an India-UK co-production directed by Richard Attenborough). If the world knows Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, Gandhiji was no less. This I am stating after my worldwide travels. We've to accept that Gandhi and, through him, India should have received its share of attention in the world. Gandhi is a solution to many of the global issues today, said PM Modi.Countering the PM, Congress's Jairam Ramesh said, ""If there is someone who has destroyed the heritage of the Mahatma, it is the 'caretaker PM'. It is his govt that has destroyed Gandhian institutions in Varanasi, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The 2024 elections are between a Mahatma follower and a Godse follower. The defeat of the 'caretaker PM' and his Godse-follower companions is evident.""In a post on X, Kharge added, ""Now lies are going to pack up and leave."" Rahul Gandhi too took a dig at Modi and said, ""Only the student of 'entire political science' would need to watch a film to know about Mahatma Gandhi.""In an interview to ABP News, Modi accused past govts of failing to conserve heritage because they viewed things from a ""slave mentality"" and also there were ""compulsions of appeasement."" Modi cited the examples of Statue of Unity, Dandi and development of Panchteerth, five places associated with of Babasaheb Ambedkar, all developed under his govt and said, ""We have to live and connect with our history. There is cultural heritage as well. Moreover, we have to brand our 500 years of struggle (of Ram Mandir) globally. When the court gave its judgment, there was absolute peace in the country. The credit of this peace goes to all.

Haryana's Sirsa half-boiled at 50.3°C

At 49.9°C, Delhi records its highest temp ever

NEW DELHI: The north Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave with temperatures in excess of 50 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan and Haryana. Delhi on Tuesday recorded its highest ever temperature with mercury reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius. Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has predicted the heatwave to continue for another two days.Rajasthan continued to suffer a blistering heat wave for the 17th consecutive day on Tuesday, with Churu being the hottest place in the state where the mercury touched the 50.5 degree Celsius mark.In most places, the maximum temperature remained almost 5 degrees above the normal for this season.Health department confirmed three deaths caused by heatstroke in Jaipur on Tuesday, taking the official toll to four in the state so far. Two women from Delhi and Karnataka, both aged 63, and a 40-year-old man from Agra were undergoing treatment for heatstroke at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. The hospital administration said despite all possible efforts, they could not be saved.Sirsa’s maximum temperature on Tuesday touched 50.3 degrees Celsius in a heatwave-gripped Haryana, where mercury crossed 44°C during peak hours at 18 stations and electrical infrastructure couldn’t take the load. The last time it was so hot in Hisar, the first Maruti car had not come out yet from Gurugram.The next three hottest districts after Sirsa were Hisar, Narnaul and Rohtak, while even the Shivalik ranges couldn’t shield foothill stations Panchkula and Chandigarh from temperatures that baked them like Ambala and Karnal. The day temperature crossed 48°C in NCR districts Faridabad, Gurugram, and Sonipat, which was 1.1-to-6.1°C above normal.The grilled spots included Balsamand in Hisar (49.3°C), Nuh (49°C), Mahendragarh (48.8°C), Jind (48.7°C), Narnaul (48.5°C), Hisar and Faridabad (48.4°C), Jhajjar (48.2°C), Charkhi Dadri (48.1°C), Ottu in Sirsa (48°C), Bawal in Rewari (47.7°C), Rohtak (47.5°C), Mahendragarh outer (47.2°C), Gurugram (47°C), Karnal (46.5°C), Palwal (46.4°C), Sonipat (46.1°C), Karnal outer (45.9°C), Panipat outer (45.4°C), and Panchkula (45°C). Just three locations recorded temperature between 44 and 45°C during peak hours.Scorching heat, cloudless skies and searing winds blowing from Rajasthan sent Tuesday’s day temperature soaring to an all-time high on record in Delhi. While the mercury shot up to 49.9°C — nine notches above normal — in Mungeshpur and Narela, it was 49.8°C in Najafgarh.Apart from Mungeshpur, Narela and Najafgarh, several areas of the city, including Pitampura, Pusa and Jafarpur, also recorded severe heatwave on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature eight to nine notches above normal.With temperatures exceeding 42 degrees Celsius, people are prone to heat stroke, which is a medical emergency characterised by an elevation in core body temperature, often exceeding 104°F (40°C). Doctors say the heat stroke may lead to central nervous system dysfunction. When the body’s ther moregulatory mechanisms fail, extreme dehydration ensues, signalling an alarm.There is little respite in sight in the next two days, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a red alert for heatwave and severe heatwave for Wednesday and an orange alert for Thursday, when the day temperature may witness a very slight drop. However, there’s a glimmer of hope: the capital may receive very light rain on Friday and Saturday, according to IMD.Punjab is due to elect its MPs on June 1, in a severe northwestern heat wave in which extreme highest temperatures have made daytime campaigning hazardous.The India meteorological department recorded the state's highest temperature of Tuesday to be 49.3 degrees Celsius at the Bathinda Airport, which was 8°C above normal. At many places in the state, the maximum temperature was between 44 and 47°C. In Bathinda town, the reading was 47.2°C. On Monday as well, Bathinda had recorded the highest temperature from across the state, at s little above 48°C.The IMD says that the temperature at the airports normally is observed to be 2 to 3°C more than the reading in the plains, since it is recorded from instruments placed at a height. The IMD has issued weather advisory, asking people to remain hydrated and avoid coming out between 11am and 4pm.In Safdarjung, the city’s base observatory, maximum temperature was 45.8 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the highest this year.","Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave.

Naicker, the lone inhabitant, was a poignant symbol of a community once thriving, now a ghost village.Meenakshipuram in Sekkarakudi panchayat had 1,296 residents according to the 2001 census. Yet, the relentless grip of environmental changes, inconsistent rainfall, and enduring droughts gradually eroded the village's lifeblood, leading to a mass exodus over the past decade. Fields once fertile turned barren, pushing families to seek stability elsewhere.Amidst this exodus, Naicker clung to Meenakshipuram, outliving his wife by 20 years and continuing to reside in the village where he was born. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.Younger son Bala Krishnan reflected on Meenakshipuram's transformation. ""The village was highly dependent on farming,"" he recounted. ""The situation began to deteriorate due to the lack of rainfall and water shortage . People had to walk 3-4km to get water and other basic facilities, which made them disinterested in staying in the village.""Naicker's last wish was to die in the village. Up until his final months, he managed his daily chores, cooking his own meals. Only recently did Krishnan arrange for someone to assist his father. Living in Kasilangapuram, 15km away, Krishnan would often bring food for his father, or Naicker would travel to his son's home.After Sunday's sundown, the man who checked on Naicker found him lifeless. ""Even though my father was a farmer, he was well-known for participating in rekla and jallikattu (bull races),"" Krishnan said.Sekkarakudi panchayat president I Ramalakshmi spoke with a heavy heart: ""There are six villages within the panchayat's limits. Now, officially we have lost a village due to the exodus that occurred over the past decade."" She noted that while the groundwater table has improved and roads have been laid in recent years, the spectre of the past struggles looms large. ""No one is ready to come and settle in the village.""As Meenakshipuram fades into memory, it stands as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by many similar villages in the region. Its abandonment underscores the harsh realities of environmental change and the inexorable forces that shape the world.","Kandasamy Naicker, 73, was a poignant symbol of a community once thriving, now a ghost village.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area, claiming it to be the highest ever recorded in India. This extreme heatwave has sparked widespread concern and debates on its accuracy and implications, prompting a closer examination of the data and its effects on daily life in the city.While the IMD's automated weather station recorded the temperature, meteorologist Soma Sen Roy indicated that the accuracy of this reading is under review. This extreme temperature surpassed the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. As the national capital grapples with this intense heat, officials have issued red alerts, emphasizing the severe health risks and urging precautions.""The maximum temperature over Delhi NCR varied from 45.2° to 49.1°C in different parts of city, Mungeshpur reported 52.9°C as an outlier compared to other stations. It could be due to error in the sensor or the local factor. IMD is examining the data and sensors,"" the IMD said in a statement.In a post on X, Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju flagged the error, saying that the temperature of 52.3 degree Celsius in Delhi is ""very unlikely.""""It is not official yet. Temperature of 52.3°C in Delhi is very unlikely. Our senior officials in IMD have been asked to verify the news report. The official position will be stated soon,"" Kiren Rijiju said in the post.Yes, according to the IMD, Delhi's Mungeshpur area recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius on May 29, 2024.However, IMD meteorologist Soma Sen Roy mentioned that they are ""checking out"" the accuracy of the recording.The recorded 52.9 degrees Celsius surpasses the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. It also broke the 50C threshold for the first time in Delhi's history.The IMD has issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of ""severe heat-wave conditions"" and highlighting the ""very high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke in all ages"". They are also reviewing the accuracy of the recorded temperature.Residents are adopting various measures such as staying indoors, using traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice), taking multiple baths, and keeping hydrated. Amit Kumar from Najafgarh mentioned, ""We're taking traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice) and using wet towels to stay cool and prevent fainting.""High temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke and dehydration. Dr. Atul Mathur warned, ""If you have not been drinking water, you will be dehydrated. For those who have pre-existing heart issues, their BP becomes high.""The intense heat has strained daily activities and essential services. The electricity grid faced a record peak demand of 8,302 megawatts. Water shortages are a significant issue, with authorities ordering measures to prevent wastage. People are also facing severe challenges in commuting and outdoor work, as highlighted by residents like Jay Pandit, who said, ""The hot wind feels like burning the skin, and it's affecting my health.""Years of scientific research suggest that climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent, and more intense. This trend poses a growing threat to public health, infrastructure, and daily life in urban areas like Delhi.The Delhi government has issued red alerts and health advisories, urging people to stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours. They have also deployed teams to prevent water wastage and manage the city's strained resources.The IMD has warned of continuing severe heatwave conditions across several northern states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The trend indicates that extreme weather events will likely become more frequent due to climate change.","The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area.

Last time, a similar simultaneous onset/progress over Kerala and North-East had happened was on May 30, 2017 triggered by Cyclone Mora that formed over east-central Bay of Bengal .This time, the possibility of simultaneous onset is attributed to Cyclone Remal that formed over Bay of Bengal last week.

Last year, the onset happened over Kerala on June 8 after a delay of seven days.Met department also predicted that the prevailing heatwave to severe heatwave conditions over northwest, including Delhi-NCR, and central India are likely to reduce gradually from Thursday. Drop in temperature can be attributed to western disturbances.MD had earlier this month predicted the possibility of monsoon onset over Kerala on May 31 with a model error of ± 4 days. Its operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset over Kerala during the past 19 years (2005-2023) were proved to be correct except in 2015.Advance of the southwest (summer) monsoon over Indian mainland is marked by monsoon onset over Kerala and is an important indicator characterizing the transition from hot and dry season to a rainy season.

NEW DELHI: The scorching heat in New Delhi has reached unprecedented levels, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recording a staggering temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in the Mungeshpur area. If confirmed, this would be the highest temperature ever recorded in India.Globally, temperatures in Death Valley's Furnace Creek, Southern California, registered 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius) in 2023, potentially the highest global temperature in over a century, according to the US national weather service (NWS). The NWS emphasized the need for formal verification before confirming this reading as the hottest temperature recorded since July 1913, highlighting the significance of this potential record .Death Valley, located in the United States, is known for its scorching temperatures. The highest temperature ever recorded on Earth was measured at Greenland Ranch, a location within Death Valley, on July 10, 1913. The temperature reached an astonishing 134°F (56.7°C), as confirmed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The soaring temperatures in India are attributed to blistering winds from Rajasthan, where temperatures peaked at 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, making it the hottest region in the country. Rajasthan's Phalodi desert region currently holds India's all-time heat record of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit), set in 2016.Pakistan is also grappling with its own heatwave , with temperatures reaching a peak of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro, rural Sindh province. The Pakistani meteorological office expects a slight decrease in temperatures from Wednesday but warns of further heatwaves in June.The heatwave in Pakistan coincides with the country's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are believed to heavily focus on addressing the country's energy supply crisis, characterized by extensive load-shedding of up to 15 hours per day in some regions.","Temperatures in New Delhi reach 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) If confirmed, this would be the highest temperature ever recorded in India.
