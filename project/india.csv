"""When will justice be delivered?,"" ask acid attack survivors as they demand stringent punishment for the culprit in Kolkata doctor's rape-murder case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-will-justice-be-delivered-ask-acid-attack-survivors-as-they-demand-stringent-punishment-for-the-culprit-in-kolkata-doctors-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112696651.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the country rages over the shocking case of rape and murder of a doctor at a govt run hospital in Kolkata, acid attack survivors have come forward in solidarity to raise the demand for speedy justice by ensuring that punishment is delivered without delay. In a stirring call for action, the founder of 'Brave Souls Foundation', Shaheen Malik, demanded to know from the authorities from a public platform that ""whether survivors like her will be able to see justice delivered during their lifetime"".She was speaking at the programme organised in the Capital to bring into focus the challenges acid attack survivors face at every step. Joining forces with women survivors of violence, Malik, who is herself an acid attack survivor, said that the Kolkata doctor 's case yet again brings into focus the vulnerability and lack of safety women grapple with everyday. ""Whenever we hear of such incidents, it forces us to relive our trauma, reminding us of our vulnerability. It reinforces the fear that perpetrators can easily disrupt our lives. The recent incident in Kolkata is particularly horrific and highlights the persistent danger we face,"" Malik said at a symposium focused on 'Reintegration - People & Policy that was organised by 'Brave Souls Foundation. Survivors called for a complete ban on sale of acid at retail shops.""Until strong and enforceable laws are in place to deter these heinous crimes, our commitment to fighting them must remain unwavering. We need to persistently work towards protecting survivors and advocating for justice, ensuring that these atrocities are not allowed to continue unchecked. Our efforts must be ongoing, focused, and resilient, as we push for meaningful change in the legal system and society,"" she added.Malik added that survivors often lose support from family and friends after an offence, whether it’s sexual assault or an acid attack, largely due to the social ostracism they endure. ""The process of obtaining compensation is equally challenging. First, survivors are often unaware of their eligibility for compensation. It is the state’s responsibility to provide adequate compensation, enabling survivors to live independently. However, the support offered is minimal. Additionally, the compensation process is lengthy and burdensome, filled with numerous formalities, causing many survivors to abandon their claims,"" Malik explained.Activists draw attention to the fact that under the current compensation scheme, a survivor of rape is entitled up to Rs 7 lakhs, a gang rape survivor can receive up to Rs10 lakhs, and an acid attack survivor can receive up to Rs 8 lakhs.""In acid attack cases, survivors typically require 15 to 20 surgeries just to survive. With each surgery costing around Rs 1 lakh, a survivor would need at least Rs 15-20 lakhs for medical treatment alone, excluding the costs of medication and legal expenses,"" Malik explained.Drawing attention to the legal concerns, advocate Choudhary Ali Zia Kabir said that to improve justice for survivors there is need to invest in judicial infrastructure by setting up more courts, appointing more judges and making way for better legal education. ""It is also important to increase awareness within the judiciary by including the issue of acid attacks as a part of curriculum at judicial academies and in training and awareness programmes,"" Kabir said. He also asserted the need to increase the representation of marginalised groups among judges to make the judiciary as diverse as the country.“Three things that activists could do is – to continue doing the wonderful work that they do; petition the courts afresh for banning acid sales; and petition the parliament via a private member’s bill encompassing prevention against acid attack and gender violence, and rights for their survivors,” Kabir said.Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh who was also present at the programme said that he will make every effort possible to raise the issue with government and parliament, and also explore the possibility of bringing the issue into focus through a private member's bill in the upper House."," acid attack survivors have come forward in solidarity to raise the demand for speedy justice by ensuring that punishment is delivered without delay.

His 15-year experience as a mail/express driver came to probably his life's best use when he jammed the emergency brakes of the train carrying 1,727 passengers and averted a major mishap.While this came as a sigh of relief, at least four recent instances of planting foreign objects on tracks such as boulders, wheels and iron rods have rung alarm bells to railway officials.The national transporter, sources said, is exploring options of using technology such as Lidar - a method of determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver - and installing CCTV cameras equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) on every locomotive. They added that sensitive areas will be identified for more intense patrolling.In the latest Sabarmati Express accident case, the Uttar Pradesh Police have lodged an FIR against unknown persons for sabotage based on a complaint by a senior railway official claiming that the ""piece of rail"" was deliberately placed on the track.Railway officials said there was another incident of iron rods being placed on the rail track near Kachhpura junction in Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh) on Aug 18. They added that the engine had hit the rods, but no accident occured. ""Three iron rods of 9 mm diameter and 11 ft long were found.

'Clear picture in one week ... ': Will BJP become Champai Soren's 'good friend' in Jharkhand?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-picture-in-one-week-will-bjp-become-champai-sorens-good-friend-in-jharkhand/articleshow/112688497.cms,"Will Champai Soren add value to BJP in Jharkhand?

Will Champai's exit harm JMM?

The problem of part-time chief ministers

NEW DELHI: Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren , who is on his way out of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha ( JMM ) after alleging ""insult and humiliation"" by the party, on Wednesday said he will not retire from politics and is ready to chart a new path, either by forming an organisation or by joining hands with any ""good friend (ally)"" who comes along the way.Champai, who was in the national capital amid reports that he is exploring options of joining the BJP , said he will take a final decision on his future course of action in a week's time. The former chief minister lost his cool when reporters suggested that there may not be enough time for forming a new party.""What is your problem? When 30,000 to 40,000 supporters have assembled here for me on a day's call, why do you think forming a new party will be difficult for me? I can easily form a new party or align with a friend,"" Champai Soren said.Champai was sworn in as 12th chief minister of Jharkhand on February 2 after Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money-laundering case. The party had then chosen him over Hemant's wife Kalpana Soren to lead the Jharkhand government. However, the bonhomie was short-lived. Less than a week after Hemant Soren was released on bail on June 28, Champai had to step down to make way for his predecessor.The senior JMM leader has claimed that he was insulted and humiliated by the party and was forced to choose an alternative path for himself. Champai had taken to social media on August 18 to share details of how he was marginalised within the party and abruptly asked to resign as chief minister. Champai also alleged that all his government programmes in the first week of July, when he was the chief minister, were abruptly cancelled by the party leadership without his knowledge.The post on X and his subsequent visit to Delhi via Kolkata, where reports said he met a senior BJP leader, set the stage for speculations of his new innings with the saffron party in Jharkhand.Champai Soren, without any doubt, is among the tallest tribal leaders of Jharkhand. The 67-year-old was once the most trusted aide of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren and had earned the sobriquet of ""Jharkhand's Tiger"" for his contribution to statehood fight.However, unlike Shibu Soren or his son Hemant, Champai does not have a huge mass following in the state. He is a 7-time MLA representing the Saraikela constituency in assembly and a very popular leader in the region.Champai after raising the banner of revolt is hopeful of finding a ""good friend"" with whom he can move forward. The ""good friend"" is perhaps a refernce to the BJP, which has heaped praise on him but has been guarded in its reactions over possible induction of Champai Soren into the saffron party.The BJP in Jharkhand already has two former tribal chief ministers in its fold - Babaulal Marandi and Arjun Munda. The saffron party also has a third former chief minister in the state Raghubar Das, who is now the governor of Odisha. However, the gubernatorial role does not rule him out from electoral politics in future as we saw during Lok Sabha elections when Tamilisai Soundararajan stepped down as Telangana governor and contested the polls for BJP in Tamil Nadu. In fact, Raghubar Das is the only leader to have completed the full term of five years as chief minister since Jharkhand was formed in 2000.The BJP would want to use Champai to counter Hemant Soren but what role can the BJP offer him? That perhaps would be the key to BJP's gameplan.Nearly half of the 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand are dominated by tribal population and that is why induction of Champai Soren may help the BJP in some areas of the state. This is definitely important for the saffron party which failed to win even one of the five Lok Sabha seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the state -- Khunti, Lohardaga, Singhbhum, Rajmahal and Dumka in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The BJP would also be wary of any possible negative fallout of Hemant Soren's charge of poaching leaders with money in an election year. The Jharkhand chief minister has accused the BJP of ""destabilising parties and breaking families."" The BJP would rather have him out of the JMM but not in the saffron party till the assembly elections. The fact that none of the BJP leaders have met him till now, seems to suggest that the saffron party has still not taken a final decision on the issue.And while the BJP top brass debates the pros and cons of having Champai Soren on board ahead of the year-end assembly elections, the JMM will definitely need to worry about the possible negative impact of his exit from the party in the Kolhan region.On record, most of the JMM leaders have said that if Champai Soren decides to leave, it will not make any difference to the party's electoral prospects. Champai, who started as an independent before joining the JMM, has been an integral part of the party for decades. His decision will influence several local leaders of Kolhan region and also the party workers for whom he has been a guiding figure.However, JMM would cite the case of Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Shibu Soren who had joined the BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections, but could not win in the family stronghold of Dumka.Hemant Soren, who already faces the charge of making JMM a family party, will also have to contend with a strong BJP campaign against him over dynasty politics and also his ""greed"" for the chair.The favourbale court observations in the ED case has emboldended Hemant Soren, who is confident of defeating the BJP if elections were held today.In the last assembly elections, the JMM won a comfortable majority in the state in alliance with its INDIA bloc partners including the Congress.Champai Soren is not the first part-time chief minister to land in such a situation. There have been instances in the past when part-time chief ministers have been forced to make bitter partings with the party and their leaders.Jeetan Manjhi, who was made chief minister of Bihar by Nitish Kumar after he resigned in 2014 taking moral responsibility for JD(U)'s humiliating Lok Sabha peformance is a case in point. Then we had O Paneerselvam who took the top post in Tamil Nadu when Jayalalitha was in legal trouble in disproportionate assets case and ended up leaving the party.Clearly, Champai should have seen this coming. After all, he was not the first choice as chief minister for the JMM. As he gets ready to start a new chapter in his political life, he would hope that he gets to meet ""good friend"" on the way to kickstart his new innings.",Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren says he will not retire from politics. The 67-year-old is exploring options of joining the saffron party. Champai was sworn in as chief minister on February 2 after Hemant Soren was arrested.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112688971,imgsize-38152,width-400,resizemode-4/112688971.jpg"
'Forced to step back ...

NEW DELHI: The Congress hit back at the Modi government 3.0 on Wednesday saying those who considered the Lok Sabha election results a triumph for the BJP might now be grasping the true significance of the mandate, as the NDA government has been compelled to retreat four times in just two months.A day after the Centre took a U-turn on UPSC lateral entry advertisement, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said the public has put a stop to the Prime Minister through the power of their votes.Pointed out the withdrawal of the proposal for lateral entry into IAS positions, the Congress leader said, ""The latest example is the cancellation of the proposal of lateral entry for IAS posts. Due to strong criticism from the opposition and the voice raised from all over the country, within just three days the government had to abandon the plan of recruiting its favourite people in the bureaucracy .""He also mentioned that the government had to withdraw the draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, in response to criticism.""The government, which has been forcibly passing bills by ignoring Parliament for 10 years, was forced to send the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to Parliament's joint committee. And in view of the huge resentment of the middle class, the government also had to restore the indexation benefit on the sale of property,"" he said.BJP's Amit Malviya, however, defended the U-turn saying ""flexibility and sensitivity remains the key"". In a long post on X, Malviya said, ""The opposition is needlessly excited, claiming victory of sorts, just because the ‘Lateral Entry’ notification, issued by the UPSC, has been withdrawn.""Clarifying that the notification has been withdrawn and not cancelled, Malviya said, ""A more specific notification likely to follow, with clear elucidation of guidelines and defined provisions of social justice, so that usual suspects can’t vitiate the environment.""""In first term, Modi Govt withdrew the Land Acquisition Bill and in second the three Farm Laws. So, the Govt is open to feedback, not obdurate. Similarly, in the first 10 years, several Bills were sent to the Standing Committees for review. Those citing Waqf Amendment Bill should note,"" he said.Malviya added that ""nothing has changed"". ""Flexibility and sensitivity remains the key. Opposition is unlikely to get an issue to agitate. They can claim moral victory all they want,"" he wrote.With the issue of reservations in lateral entries , the opposition picked up from where it left off in its Lok Sabha election campaign when it turned BJP's ambition to post a 400+ score to its advantage by alleging that the bid for super majority was meant to scrap caste quotas by amending the Constitution.The Centre's decision came amid increasing criticism from both the opposition and the NDA allies.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the Union government had to cancel the recruitment due to resistance by a strong opposition. ""Recently they introduced lateral entry. They tried to appoint joint secretary (rank officers) ... But I heard that lateral entry appointments have been withdrawn. This is because the opposition is strong,"" Kharge said.Meanwhile, NDA allies also welcomed the move.LJP chief Chirag Paswan expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for listening and addressing the ‘pain’ of backward classes.“We thank the Prime Minister for taking back the partisan proposal and making course corrections for the benefit of all communities including the backward and marginalised classes. This shows PM Modi’s firm belief in ensuring principles of social justice,” Paswan said.He also said that his party lodged a protest against the lateral entry program on the grounds that since previous governments didn’t give weightage to the reservation, it didn’t mean that we should also follow the same precedent.HAM chief Jitan Ram Manjhi welcomed the rollback order and said that this was a step in the right direction and also credited the PM for the move.“PM Modi has rightly taken note of the public sentiment and ordered the cancellation of UPSC advertisement,” he said.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the public has put a stop to the Prime Minister through the power of their votes.

Euthanasia: SC rejects parents’ plea for euthanasia for son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-parents-plea-for-euthanasia-for-son/articleshow/112664558.cms,"SC Asks Centre To Examine Long-Term Aid For 30-Yr-Old

NEW DELHI: Unable to bear their only son ’s 11-year-long vegetative state , mounting expenses and doctors promising little chance of recovery, the parents of a 30-year-old man on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to constitute a medical board to examine withdrawal of the Ryles tube , through which he has been fed, to relieve their lone child of suffering through passive euthanasia .A Ryles tube is a disposable tube inserted through the nose into the stomach, providing access to the nasogastric tract. It is used both to deliver food and medicine to the stomach.However, SC said, “Removal of the Ryles tube is not part of passive euthanasia. If the Ryles tube is removed, the patient will starve and die.” It also asked govt to “please find out if some institution can take care of this person”.Despite limited income, parents — 62-year-old Ashok Rana and 55-year-old Nirmala Devi — fought on to save their son who suffered severe head injury and quadriplegia (100% disability) after falling from the fourth floor of a paying guest accommodation at Mohali while pursuing a graduation course in civil engineering.While pleading that the meagre pension of the father was not enough to sustain the family, their counsel told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that they were forced to sell their house in 2021 to meet their son’s mounting medical expenses. The bench said Delhi HC had rightly dismissed their petition for passive euthanasia as was permitted by the SC, first in 2018 through a judgment and then last year by relaxing the procedure for removal of life support from terminally-ill patients in vegetative state with no real chance of revival. “Removal of the Ryles tube is not part of passive euthanasia. If the Ryles tube is removed, the patient will starve and die. Passive euthanasia is very different. Ryles tube is not a life support system,” the bench said.The bench, however, could not wash its hands of the heart-rending case, as the parents have struggled for more than a decade, spent their life’s savings and yet see no light at the end of a long and arduous journey.The bench requested additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to consult the Union govt on whether some permanent solution can be found — to take care of the 30-year-old man in vegetative state and relieve the parents of their financial constraints. “It is a very hard case. The parents have struggled for 13 years and can no longer take care of their son’s medical bills,” the CJI said.“Please find out if some institution can take care of this person. We cannot permit passive euthanasia as he is not on life support system, even though fed through Ryles tube,” the bench said. Bhati said she would consult the health ministry and respond.",Parents of a 30-year-old man on Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to constitute a medical board to examine withdrawal of the Ryles tube through which he has been fed.

Vande Bharat Metro to run between Vadodara and Ahmedabad: Trial runs soon; new high-speed corridor announced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharat-metro-to-run-between-vadodara-and-ahmedabad-trial-runs-soon-new-high-speed-corridor-announced/articleshow/112679753.cms,"High-speed corridor to boost connectivity

Following the success of the Vande Bharat Express trains, Indian Railways is preparing to introduce the Vande Bharat Metro in Gujarat . This upcoming metro service will be the first of its kind in the nation and is set to start trial runs soon. The Vande Bharat Metro will operate between Vadodara and Ahmedabad, with trial runs scheduled to begin in the near future.According to the reports, JK Jayant, Chief Spokesperson of Western Railway, confirmed that the trials will commence within the coming days. This initiative aims to enhance connectivity and efficiency, particularly after recent upgrades to the railway route between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.The Vande Bharat Metro is designed to cater to the needs of daily commuters, providing a time-efficient travel option. Jayant emphasized that the final decision on the metro's route will be made soon, ensuring that the service is optimized for travelers.Recently, a 20-coach Vande Bharat train was tested at Kalupur railway station in Ahmedabad, reaching speeds of 130 kilometers per hour. The trial, overseen by Western Railway officials and engineers, demonstrated the train’s capabilities. Given the high demand and full occupancy of the current 16-coach Vande Bharat trains, the new 20-coach train is expected to significantly improve service.In addition to the metro service, Gujarat is set to benefit from a new 214 km High-Speed Corridor between Tharad and Ahmedabad. This six-lane corridor will enhance road connectivity for residents of these cities and neighboring states, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Delhi. The project has been approved by the Union Cabinet, with a budget of over Rs 10,500 crore allocated for its development. This infrastructure project aims to facilitate smoother and faster travel, further boosting the region’s connectivity.","Indian Railways is preparing to introduce the Vande Bharat Metro in Gujarat.

India should clearly speak out where international law is broken: German MP Jurgen Hardt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-should-clearly-speak-out-where-international-law-is-broken-german-mp-jurgen-hardt/articleshow/112687648.cms,"International eyes are again on India as Modi undertakes a visit to Ukraine two years after the beginning of full-scale war in that country.

Jurgen Hardt

, German MP and foreign policy spokesperson of the German CDU, spoke with

Rudroneel Ghosh

, about hot-button geopolitical issues and India's approach to them:

PM Modi is visiting Ukraine soon. With the Ukraine war in its third year, what needs to happen for a ceasefire?

Has EU reached a stage where it can’t have any ties with Russia for the foreseeable future?

But that strategy failed.

What are your thoughts about US elections? Will a potential return of Trump take us back to Trans-Atlantic confrontations?

Has Europe found a solution to China’s weaponisation of economic interdependencies?

But they keep threatening Taiwan.

How do you see India’s role in geopolitics today?

The curious thing about that conflict is that no one is talking about what Russia has to give for peace.The only demand on Russia is to respect the Ukrainian border and promise not to attack Ukraine again. Therefore, the negotiating position of Ukraine is clear but also probably weak. The only chance of bringing Putin to the negotiating table is through ensuring that he and his immediate coterie feel that they can risk losing in some way. For example, like losing Crimea. Putin then will not be able to continue his so-called operation against ‘fascists’ and it will shutter the whole Russian system. Thus, I see the chance that Putin himself, before it comes to a situation where he loses, will declare that he has actually won the war and stop fighting. Then the rest of the world has to smile to this lie and do something to ensure durable peace. But this will only happen if Putin believes failure is possible. We have to ensure Putin fails.Nobody in Europe wanted to cut ties with Russia the country. But we also see no chance of cooperating with the govt of Putin. This is not a legitimate govt in terms of democratic elections and rule of law. So it is possible that in future we might see a Russia that is totally different from what it is today. We did make a lot of attempts to bind Russia to Europe. We did economic associations, bought Russian oil and gas, because we believed that a weak Russia is a problem for us and we should stabilise this country.The strategy failed on account of Putin but it doesn’t mean that it isn’t a good strategy generally. Russia always skipped the opportunity to do most of the work with the EU. And the reason for that is Putin fears the rule of law. Because every closer cooperation with EU creates situations for independent justice. And Putin clearly doesn’t want rule of law and hopes to retain his oligarchical system.What we saw in the four years of Trump is that it took a relatively long time before he was able to make concrete demands on Europe. Because he wasn’t well prepared for office. I am sure that won’t be the case this time should he win. So in case of Trump presidency , we should be prepared for a more competitive scenario from day one.That said, we also have the experience of getting things done with him. You have to figure out what he really wants. For example, last time we had reached a situation where the automobile industry was secured because we made a deal with Trump on import of soya beans from the American Mid-west to EU. This is how Trump does politics. So EU should identify those items on which we can do deals with a potential Trump presidency.Meanwhile, I say we missed the chance to help Biden to give proof that his cooperative approach is better, even for the American people, than Trump’s confrontationist approach. The Biden-Harris team has been very good and stable on foreign policy and security issues, no matter what people say about Biden’s age.I agree that Chinese trade policy has become ‘martialised’. But we also see that the Chinese govt needs good trade relations to maintain the social contract in China. This social contract is under strain now, and if you talk to Chinese officials, they are very open about the fact that they face the risks of economic chaos, housing bubble, and several other questions. Their biggest problem is demography. So I think that they also don’t really want to do something disruptive, like attacking Taiwan.True, but they failed to influence the elections in Taiwan this year, they failed in blackmailing the Taiwanese and the rest of the world. Sure, there is muscle-flexing from Beijing. But it knows it needs good trade relations with the world. In response, we should combine approaches of US, G7 , Germany and friends like India. Then we will have the chance to get China to make compromises. The key here is reciprocity. If China can have stakes in the Hamburg port, why can’t we have stakes in the Shanghai port? Also, with respect to Chinese investment projects, should such projects also be financed by China? Because this runs the risk of China acquiring assets in case the project fails. So we have to think deeply about such things.India and Germany are among the top 5 economies in world. Given our economic power, both India and Germany should take a more engaged role in international affairs.I respect India’s traditional neutral, bloc-free approach. I also appreciate the role that India plays in Brics and G20. But we should be clear that neutrality should not hinder a govt from speaking out against breaking of international law. Because international law is global. This is the fairytale that Russian and Chinese presidents make up that international law is somehow a Western invention. Therefore, India should be encouraged to maintain its neutral position but clearly speak out where international law is broken, for example with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","German MP Jurgen Hardt spoke with Rudroneel Ghosh about hot-button geopolitical issues and India's approach to them.

The case involved a resident of Chandrapur in Maharashtra and employed with an educational institution. She was accused of having an extramarital affair with the complainant's husband. Police charged her, along with the husband and his family, under Section 498A.The petitioner argued Section 498A could only apply to the husband and his relatives, not to a third party involved in an extramarital affair. The woman contended she was charged due to a personal grudge as she was close to the complainant's husband.According to experts, the judgment provides clarity on the scope of domestic violence laws and reinforces the principle of not expanding the statutory definition of ""relative"" beyond its intended meaning. As extramarital affairs are sensitive and complex, the HC ruling is likely to have a considerable impact on the way such cases are approached and adjudicatedin the future. Earlier, the SC had said Section 498A should not be automatically applied in every case of domestic violence, holding that a single instance of inappropriate behaviour does not constitute harassment or cruelty."," Bombay high court's Nagpur bench recently held that a husband's girlfriend cannot be considered a ""relative"" under domestic violence laws.

The Pakistan flag was used as a prop in the play, just as Britain’s flag was, since it was based on India’s freedom struggle and Partition.But ABVP , BJP’s student wing, protested against it and staged a demonstration in front of the Ratlam collectorate on Wednesday and blocked the Mhow-Neemuch Road for an hour, demanding action against the school.The school says an edited clip of the video was posted by someone on social media, giving a wrong picture. “I have received information about this incident. The matter has been passed on to local police for investigation.We have not initiated any action through the education department,” Ratlam collector Rajesh Batham told TOI. “Preschools do not have any affiliation or recognition from the education department. Thus, we have not initiated any action in this regard,” Ratlam DEO in charge Ashok Lodha said. The skit was part of a cultural programme held at the preschool on Independence Day.A seven-minute video of the play was shared on the school’s social media page the following day. It starts with the children celebrating Indian culture and diversity, showing people of different religions living in harmony.Towards the end, most of the kids are seen holding up the Tricolour and a lone child is seen with the Pakistan flag as the narrator describes the Partition. As soon as the scene is over, the Pakistan flag is taken off stage. However, the video soon sparked outrage on social media. The school management said the video was misinterpreted. “The play was intended to educate the children about India’s struggle for Independence, including Partition. The Pakistani flag was used as part of a historical scene.The scene depicting Partition required the presence of both the flags. Someone cropped that portion from the original video and shared it on social media, and this led to a misinterpretation,” Deepak Panth, dir","The Pakistan flag was used as a prop in the play, just as Britain’s flag was, since it was based on India's freedom struggle and Partition.

The party's founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed first won here in 1967 as a Congress candidate, and his daughter Mehbooba claimed victory there in 1996. The family has deep roots in the area, with Iltija's father Javid Shah also hailing from the area.From 1999 to 2018, PDP's Abdul Rehman Veeri, also known as Abdul Rehman Bhat, held the seat and served as a minister in successive Mufti govts. Mehbooba's decision to field her daughter has stirred discontent, as Veeri now plans to run as an independent candidate from Srigufwara-Bijbehara, although the party has offered him a ticket for Anantnag East.""Since this will be Iltija's first election, Mehbooba is keen to secure a safe constituency for her. But Veeri could complicate matters if he decides to file his nomination for that constituency instead of the one assigned to him, as he enjoys considerable support among Bijbehara's voters,"" a source said Wednesday.This has added to the tension within PDP, as other party members have also expressed dissatisfaction with candidate selections. Senior party figure Suhail Bukhari resigned after the ticket for Sangrama constituency in north Kashmir was given to Basharat Bukhari - who deserted PDP in 2019 to join NC, briefly went to Sajad Gani Lone's Peoples Conference, and returned to PDP this year. PDP decided to field the turncoat as he had represented the constituency twice.Several other PDP members, including former MLA Ajaz Mir, have defected to Awami Itehad Party (AIP) of Baramulla's independent MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh aka Engineer Rashid. Arrested in 2019 on terrorism-funding charges and currently in New Delhi's Tihar jail, Rashid's party has been gaining support from disillusioned politicians ahead of the elections.Iltija, a political science graduate from Delhi University and holder of a master's degree in international relations from Warwick University in England, entered active politics following the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.She acted as the party's spokesperson during her mother's house arrest and campaigned extensively for her in Anantnag-Rajouri during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, Mehbooba lost to National Conference's Mian Altaf.

Ali has claimed that he had complained to the state authorities against Ghosh for irregularities but no action was taken on his plaint filed last year.The former RG Kar Hospital principal is currently being interrogated by the CBI, which is looking at his role in the rape and murder of a doctor with the hospital.Ghosh is also alleged to have promoted cartels for procurements and construction work in the hospital and having received bribes. The ED's probe under the PMLA is more extensive in terms of establishing a money trail to track proceeds of crime, and this also involves questioning other suspects, including contractors, middlemen and politicians.Kolkata Police have registered an FIR at Tala police station on Monday based on a complaint from the health department of West Bengal govt, accusing Ghosh and others of a criminal conspiracy and alleged nexus with contractors in award of procurements and works related to the hospital.

Similarly, the Muslim Jamadar community was recommended to be added to the list the day (April 21, 2010) it filed an application: a feat considering the pace with which govt machinery moves as also the intricate nature of the task.The OBC Commission matched the astonishing alacrity and took just a day to recommend inclusion of Gayen (Muslim) and Bhatia Muslim communities in the list, four days for Muslim Chutor Mistri community, and less than a month for inclusion of a dozen other Muslim communities to the OBC list.The affidavit of West Bengal govt, which is under fire for alleged arbitrary inclusion of 77 castes, 75 of them Muslims, was full of surprises. In some cases, the survey for sub-categorisation of communities was conducted even prior to community members filing an application before the Commission seeking their inclusion in the OBC list. Surveys for some Muslim communities - Kazi, Kotal, Hazari, Layek and Khas - were done in June 2015 but they had filed applications much later, in some cases after nearly a year or two.""It was only after a detailed enquiry and/or upon consideration of the material before it in oral or documentary nature, that a final report on each of the 34 communities was prepared along with the final recommendation by the Commission,"" the state said in response to the CJI D Y Chandrachud-led bench's Aug 5 order seeking information about the process adopted for inclusion in OBC list.On Aug 5, SC had asked WB to ""explain the process"" followed for designating 77 communities (75 of them Muslims) as OBCs between 2010 and 2012 and the nature of survey carried out on the twin aspects of social and educational backwardness and inadequacy of representation in services of the state. The Mamata Banerjee govt had appealed against a Calcutta HC decision to quash such inclusions in OBC list without following the procedure. SC had refused to stay HC order.The affidavit filed by Abhijit Mukherjee, additional secretary and ex-officio joint commissioner of reservation at backward classes welfare department, stated that the process commences with an application by individuals who seek inclusion in the OBC list detailing the name of class, size of its population, its place of concentration, along with social, educational, matrimonial, occupational and economic data. The affidavit said the three-tier process was scrupulously followed by the state.After submission of such an application, the commission carries out field surveys through its members (before 2012) or through state govt's Cultural Research Institute (CRI) and the anthropologists with them (after 2012). During such a survey, the commission issues public notice regarding hearing on the application as well as objections to the claim.At the hearing, the commission examines records, survey inputs, inquiries and material adduced during public hearings, to either accept the application or reject it. On acceptance, it recommends inclusion of a community in the OBC list, which the state said is ""ordinarily binding"" on govt. It is then placed for approval of the Cabinet. After such approval, it is published in the official gazette.","West Bengal govt is under fire for alleged arbitrary inclusion of 77 castes, 75 of them Muslims.
