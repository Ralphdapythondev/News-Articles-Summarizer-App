"Hindenburg report: Government unlikely to wade into row, officials say report 'malicious'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindenburg-report-government-unlikely-to-wade-into-row-officials-say-report-malicious/articleshow/112453009.cms,"Top Picks For You Full statement of Sebi chief, her husband on Hindenburg allegations

NEW DELHI: Government is unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report as senior officials believe that the charges against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, are ""untrue and malicious"" and are in response to the regulator 's notice to the short seller.They alleged that Hindenburg may also be trying to make a quick buck from the Indian markets through its latest action and the regulator and govt are keeping a close tab on how the developments unfold.Describing it as a fresh attempt to ""create a smokescreen"", a govt source suggested that this may be part of a larger attempt to discredit the regulator at a time when the Indian stock market is seeing a good run on the back of healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and strong growth prospects with clean corporate and bank balance sheets. The source alleged such actions were part of a pattern to hit Indian markets but argued that the markets were now strong and deep enough to withstand Hindenburg-type attacks.""There have been a series of regulatory actions to improve the overall functioning of the markets and the regulator itself has not shied away from cautioning investors, wherever it sees pressure building up,"" another official said, while listing out a host of measures taken by Sebi. The officer said that Sebi has submitted its probe findings on issues raised by Hindenburg in its earlier report to the Supreme Court.Pointing to the statements issued by Madhabi Puri Buch and Dhaval Buch , who both worked in the private sector, officials said required disclosures had been made, which may not be in public domain like those of civil servants.While suggesting that some of Puri Buch's actions may have upset some of the market participants, sources said, the regulator has followed an elaborate consultation paper, even in the case of REITs, amid suggestions by Hindenburg that the rules benefited Blackstone, where Dhaval is an adviser.Market players are closely monitoring govt's response, given that Puri Buch has over six months to go as Sebi chief and is eligible for another term. She took over as Sebi chief in March 2022 and was given a three-year term.","Government unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report.

Farmers will receive seeds of all new varieties within three years.Lauding scientists for development of these varieties, the PM said they would lead to value addition, thus boosting farmers' income.PM proposed that experts from KVKs, ICAR and state agricultural universities engage with farmers one day each month and the goal of this exchange should be to tackle a current issue related to agriculture and attempt to identify answers through mutual learning.Such an exchange will be helpful in handling the simmering tensions among farmers at a time when a section of them has constantly been on protest demanding better price for their produce either through MSP or other interventions.These crop varieties have been developed for different agro-climatic zones of the country, focusing on short duration, resistance to floods and droughts/heat, and adaptability to various biotic and abiotic conditions.Interacting with farmers at the farms of ICAR-IARI, Modi said these varieties of different crops will increase yield as well as farmers' income in addition to encouraging them towards environment-friendly sustainable farming practices.The PM also discussed importance of millets. On benefits of natural farming, he said people have started consuming and demanding organic food and adoption of organic farming will be quite beneficial for farmers.Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan accompanied Modi to ICAR-IARI farms.","PM Narendra Modi on Sunday released 109 high-yielding, climate-resilient and biofortified varieties of 61 crops, including 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops.

"Sub-quota a plot to divide & rule Dalits, allege SP veterans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sub-quota-a-plot-to-divide-rule-dalits-allege-sp-veterans/articleshow/112450919.cms,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party ’s Dalit functionaries have dubbed the proposal of sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes a ploy to “divide and rule”, arguing that the party stands strongly for the unity of the community as prescribed by Ambedkar.Veteran MPs RK Chaudhary and Awadhesh Prasad told TOI that division of SCs into sub-groups will sound the death knell of Dalit unity, which cannot be accepted.“SP led by Akhilesh Yadav stands resolutely with the SC/ST community. SCs are one bloc and there should be no change in it,” he said.The views of the MP duo from Uttar Pradesh came as SP is positioning itself to tap into BSP’s support base which has diminished amid steady erosion of its Dalit base. Several BSP members have joined SP, with Chaudhary being a key figure from Kanshi Ram’s era. As Mayawati has come out strongly against the Supreme Court judgment on sub-categorisation and has historically stood for a single bloc of SCs, the views of SP’s Dalit brass are politically significant given its firm eyes on the fragmenting BSP vote bank.Chaudhary said Kanshi Ram played a big role in uniting Dalits across divisions and sub-catergorisation will be an assault on that unity. “Kanshi Ram believed they should unite and only with the united struggle of the ‘Bahujan Samaj’ which includes SC, ST and OBCs, can the community succeed in securing its participation (in the society),” he said.Prasad said Ambedkar enshrined in the Constitution the privilege for the entire SC community and “splitting them as Pasi, Raidas, Dhanuk, Koeri” will not work. Questioning the argument over affirmative action benefits being monopolized by some dominant sub-castes, Chaudhary said sub-categorisation is not the answer to the issue. “The Supreme Court has not studied the issue but decided according to the ‘mahaul’... nobody is stopping the other (weaker) sub-castes,” he said.",Samajwadi Party’s Dalit functionaries have dubbed the proposal of sub- categorisation of Scheduled Castes a ploy to “divide and rule” The party stands strongly for the unity of the community as prescribed by Ambedkar.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112450910,imgsize-319540,width-400,resizemode-4/112450910.jpg"

‘I still have many good throws left in me’

Beginning Of Neeraj Chopra: When Javelin Star Impressed Coach Despite Finishing 5th In State Meet

Neeraj Chopra, World Champion & Olympic Champion | 'The Road Less Taken Part 2: Highs And Lows'

Road Less Taken Part 3: Higher. Faster. Stronger

PARIS: When Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final Thursday night, the pressure was on Neeraj Chopra to better it.The Indian believed he could do it, but in his desperation to go past his Pakistani rival’s mark, he ended up with four foul throws. Trying to come to terms with his first loss to Nadeem since 2016, Neeraj, who threw 89.45m and bagged silver, said a nagging groin injury has been bothering him.“When I get ready for my throws, 70-80% of my focus is on my injury as I don’t want to aggravate it. My speed drops and so I start pushing myself. Before the last World Championships , the doctor had advised me to go for surgery . But I didn’t have the time. I couldn’t do it before Olympics either. But (now) I will have to make a big decision,” the current world champion said here after the event, adding that the same throw could have been four metres further had he been in perfect shape.Despite the disappointment of not winning back-to-back Olympic gold, many consider Neeraj the greatest-ever Indian athlete. He, though, remains humble. “It’s been a great journey after starting from a small village,” he said.Starting off, Neeraj never believed he would be on the Olympic podium one day. “I didn’t have the physique or the background. I don’t know how I reached this far,” Neeraj said.Talking about his injury, “It was in 2017 that I felt the groin pain for the first time and after that I had a lot of treatment. At the beginning of this year, everything was perfect. Maybe (I have to undergo) surgery… I will speak to my team and make a decision,” Neeraj said. The champion athlete had tried to play down the injury in the build-up to the Olympics, but now that it’s all down, he was ready to explain how difficult it was. “I was not able to throw using my full runway for the last couple of years.Normally, we make 40-50 throws in each session. But in my case the session itself was happening once every two or three weeks because of the injury scare. Till you throw, you are not working with the javelin and then it is very difficult to lift it. But now I’m throwing because I have the belief in my hand,” Neeraj said. The champion said he won’t rest till he manages the big throws.“I still have many good throws left in me. Until I achieve that, I won’t get peace. I now realise that mindset is very important going into an Olympics. I will surely do it if my body is willing to come along as my mind will be ready. If you can stay away from injury, then your throw gets bigger and bigger,” the 26-year-old said. Neeraj’s first throw on Thursday was a foul, but that didn’t affect his confidence.“After the foul in the first throw, I had confidence ahead of the second throw that I could do it. I was pushing myself a lot but the throw was good and I can tell you that I still have a lot of big throws left in me. For that I have to keep myself fit.” Asked what changed between the qualification when he appeared in great form and the final, the 26-year-old said: “In the qualification round it’s all easy and relaxed. But finals are different. I tried to keep my mind the same but it was hard. I tried to go really fast on the runway but it didn’t work.Even in qualification I was really close to the line but I stopped within one step.” The pulls and pressures of commercial commitments become part and parcel of a top athlete’s life, but Neeraj has learnt to take that in his stride.“After Tokyo, I gave priority to sports. With great difficulty we get a chance to endorse a brand. So if you get a chance then who will leave it? But I don’t want to overdo it, because if my body breaks, nothing will be left.” Neeraj was tired but his sense of humour was intact. “Motivating myself to talk in English is almost like being in competition with the best in the business,” he said as everyone burst into laughter.","Neeraj Chopra threw 89.45m and bagged silver in the javelin final.

beats Cruz to clinch sixth medal for India

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification. It came as a much-needed balm.","Aman Sehrawat is the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship.

NEW DELHI: Olympic medalist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has expressed optimism about fellow Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat 's ongoing appeal regarding her disqualification from the Paris Olympics . The Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) has extended the deadline for delivering its verdict on Phogat's appeal to Tuesday, August 13, 2024. Dutt hopes for a favorable outcome that could add another medal to India's tally.In a conversation with ANI, Dutt commented, ""CAS has extended the time for a verdict on Vinesh's appeal till August 13...We are hoping for something positive... We have won six medals, I hope something positive will happen, adding one more medal to the tally.""Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the Paris Olympics final due to a slight breach of the weight limit. She had been a strong contender for gold after defeating Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez in the semi-finals. Her disqualification occurred on the day of her scheduled match against Sarah Ann Hildebrandt of the United States for the gold medal. Phogat has since appealed to CAS to be awarded the silver medal instead.Dutt highlighted the contributions of wrestling to India's Olympic medal count for the fifth consecutive Olympics, noting Aman Sehrawat's recent bronze medal in the 57kg freestyle event.

INDIA bloc allies target 'Adani-Sebi' connection, attacks BJP govt

Hindenburg report claims Adani's regulator immunity tied to Sebi chairperson

Adani Group dismisses Hindenburg claims

NEW DELHI: The political clash between Congress and the BJP intensified on Sunday after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research levelled allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch . The Congress party demanded immediate government action to address potential conflicts of interest in the regulator's investigation of the Adani Group and called for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to investigate the full scope of the ""scam"" involving senior officials.Hindenburg's latest report accused Buch and her husband of having stakes in offshore funds allegedly linked to the Adani money siphoning scandal.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that Sebi had previously cleared ""Adani, a close associate of PM Modi,"" in the Supreme Court following the January 2023 revelations by Hindenburg Research.However, he noted that new allegations have now emerged involving a ""quid-pro-quo"" concerning the Sebi chief.""The small & medium investors belonging to the middle class who invest their hard-earned money in the stock market need to be protected, as they believe in the Sebi. A joint parliamentary committee (JPC) inquiry is imperative to investigate this massive scandal,"" he said.""Until then, concerns persist that PM Modi will continue to shield his ally, compromising India's Constitutional institutions, painstakingly built over seven decades,"" Kharge said in a post on X.In response, BJP leader Rajeev Chandrashekhar dismissed the allegations as part of a ""conspiracy"" to destabilise India's financial system. He also accused the opposition party of seeking foreign assistance to undermine the independent regulator, Sebi, and to create chaos in the country.""This is a conspiracy and some forces are working together to destabilise India's economy and discredit our regulator, stock markets and financial system. It is something that we should never allow as our country is on the path of expansion and growth. Using these innuendos and lies against an independent regulator is a crime. Nothing in the report is credible. This is a conspiracy and deliberate attack on India's economy,"" said Chandrasekhar.The grand old party has also questioned why Sebi's official twitter account is currently locked and inaccessible to the public.Later in the day, leader of opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asserted that the integrity of Sebi has been seriously undermined by the allegations against its chairperson.""The integrity of Sebi, the securities regulator entrusted with safeguarding the wealth of small retail investors, has been gravely compromised by the allegations against its chairperson,"" Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.Rahul also questioned why Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch has not resigned, calling on the government for an explanation. He further inquired, ""If investors lose their hard-earned money, who will be held accountable—PM Modi, the SEBI Chairperson, or Gautam Adani?""In a post on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that Sebi's official Twitter account is ""locked"" and thus inaccessible to the general public.""Some reports suggest it may have been locked for a while, but this continued inaccessibility - at a time when evidence of conflict of interest by its top leadership has come out - is puzzling. The Modani scandal has been brewing for many months now, and the Sebi's inaction has been a recurring disappointment,"" Ramesh said.He raised concerns about why the account was locked, saying, ""This opacity leads to questions about whether the platform has been quietly deleting past advisories/press releases which may be incriminating the organisation/its leadership on the Modani scam,"" Ramesh said.Meanwhile, the BJP MP and spokesperson, Sudhanshu Trivedi intimated the Congress's involvement behind the Hindenburg report and said such foreign reports come only at the commencement of Parliament session.In an interview with a news agency, Trivedi said, ""For the past few years, whenever the Parliament session commences, a foreign report gets released. BBC documentary was released just before the Parliament session. The Hindenburg report came in January just before the Parliament session. Sometimes there is a report on religious freedom or sometimes there is a report on farmers from foreign countries or sometimes Greta Thunberg's statement. All these sequences happen during the Parliament session. Today, when the opposition is carrying forward such reports, then it is suspected that the opposition has some connections with the abroad to create instability and anarchy during every Parliament session of India.""Allies of the INDIA bloc have also focused on the 'Adani-Sebi' connection highlighted in the Hindenburg report. The Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, and CPI(M) have criticised the ruling BJP-led NDA government for its close ties with industrialist Gautam Adani.AAP MP Sanjay Singh has alleged that the Modi govt is deeply embroiled in corruption and is attempting to protect ""their friend Adani.""In a post on X, Singh claimed, ""The Hindenburg revelations were hinted at three days before Modi ended the Parliament session. The Modi Government is corrupt from top to bottom. To shield his friend Adani, Modi Ji has had the investigation handled by the same Sebi chairperson allegedly involved in the scam with Adani. The Supreme Court should reconsider its decision.""TMC leader Mahua Moitra also took to X, posting, ""In true Adani style, even the Sebi Chairman is an investor in his group. Crony capitalism at its finest. @CBIHeadquarters & @Dir_ED – will you be filing POCA and PMLA cases or not?""CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, in a post on X, said, ""The latest Hindenburg revelations have accused the regulator, SEBI, and that its chairperson herself is part of the manipulation. She must immediately quit and a Joint Parliamentary Committee to be constituted for the investigation.""Earlier on Saturday, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research made new allegations, claiming, ""We had previously noted Adani's total confidence in continuing to operate without the risk of serious regulatory intervention, suggesting that this may be explained through Adani's relationship with Sebi chairperson, Madhabi Buch.""The report went on to assert, ""What we hadn't realised: the current Sebi chairperson and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had hidden stakes in the exact same obscure offshore Bermuda and Mauritius funds, found in the same complex nested structure, used by Vinod Adani.""Hindenburg Research stated that these new allegations are based on documents provided by a whistleblower and investigations conducted by other entities.In January 2023, Hindenburg had published a report accusing the Adani Group of financial irregularities, which led to a significant drop in the company's stock price. The Adani Group had strongly denied these claims at the time.The Hindenburg report alleged stock manipulation and fraud by the Adani Group, claiming the conglomerate had inflated its share prices. Following the publication of these allegations, there was a sharp decline in the stock prices of various Adani Group companies.In January 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a request to transfer the investigation into the stock price manipulation allegations to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and instructed market regulator Sebi to conclude its probe into two pending cases within three months.Earlier this year, the top court also dismissed a plea to review its previous verdict, which had mandated an investigation by Sebi into the Adani-Hindenburg case.However, the Adani Group has strongly rejected the recent claims from Hindenburg Research, dismissing them as ""distractions from a desperate organisation showing complete disregard for Indian laws.""","US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research levelled allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch.

"Prime Minister Modi releases 109 new varieties of crops, suggests farm experts to engage with farmers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prime-minister-modi-releases-109-new-varieties-of-crops-suggests-farm-experts-to-engage-with-farmers/articleshow/112446631.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday released 109 high-yielding, climate-resilient and biofortified varieties of 61 crops, including 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops, and suggested that the ‘ Krishi Vigyan Kendras ’ (KVKs) - agri extension centres - should proactively inform farmers about the benefits of the new varieties as it will help them produce more, spend less and earn more.Farmers will receive seeds of all these new varieties within three years.The Prime Minister also proposed that experts from KVKs, Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ), and state agricultural universities engage with farmers one day each month and the goal of this exchange should be to tackle a current issue related to agriculture and attempt to identify answers through mutual learning.It is expected that the regular interaction may not only help farmers know the best farm practices and effectiveness of new varieties but also solve their problems of how to get the best price of their produce. Such an exchange may also be helpful in handling the simmering tensions among farmers at a time when a section of them has constantly been on protest mode demanding better price of their produce either through minimum support price (MSP) or other interventions.New crop varieties, developed by scientists of ICAR, include nine of paddy, six of maize, two of wheat, one each of jawar, bajra and ragi, seven of different oilseeds, 11 of pulses, five of cotton and four of sugarcane. Among horticultural crops, the new varieties include three of mango, two of guava, one of pomegranate and two of tomato among others fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. These crop varieties are developed for different agro-climatic zones of the country, focusing on short duration, resistance to floods and droughts/heat, and adaptability to various biotic and abiotic conditions.Interacting with farmers here at farms of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), PM Modi emphasised on how these climate-resilient varieties of different crops would increase the yield as well as farmers' income in addition to encouraging them towards environment-friendly sustainable farming practices.The Prime Minister on the occasion also discussed the importance of millets and underlined how people are moving towards nutritious food. Talking about the benefits of natural farming and the increasing faith of common people towards organic farming, he noted that people have started consuming and demanding organic foods and therefore adoption oforganic farming by farmers would be quite beneficial for them.Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also accompanied PM Modi to the ICAR-IARI farms. Calling it a historic day for farmers, he said the release of new varieties of crops is the best example of a ""lab to land"" programme.The move to release these 109 new varieties was announced by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her budget presentation on July 23. Release of new improved varieties of seeds is a regular process by the ICAR which is driving innovation and technology development to maintain the agri-productivity, keeping in view changing climate and evolving biotic and abiotic stresses.The ICAR - premier public sector farm research institution - released as many as 323 varieties of 56 crops including cereals, oilseeds, forage crops, and sugarcane were released during 2023-24. These varieties include 27 biofortified and 289 climate-resilient varieties for the various biotic and abiotic stresses.The ICAR's records show that a total of 2,593 high-yielding varieties were released during 2014-15 to 2023-24. These varieties include 2,177 climate resilient (83% of total) with biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and 150 biofortified ones. High-yielding fine grain aromatic Basmati rice varieties (Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa basmati 1509, Pusa Basmati 1401 and Pusa Basmati 17180, which contribute to annual export of more than Rs. 42,000 crores, are among the most successful varieties developed by the institution.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday released 109 high-yielding, climate- resilient and biofortified varieties of 61 crops, including 34 field crops and 27 horticultural crops.

India Commissions INS Arighat: Second Nuclear Submarine Armed with Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fully-ready-to-add-to-fleet-2nd-sub-with-n-tipped-missiles/articleshow/112433199.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is now all set to commission its second nuclear-powered submarine armed with nuclear missiles for strategic deterrence, while the project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat , constructed at the ship-building centre (SBC) at Vizag, is “fully ready” for formal commissioning after extensive trials that saw some technical issues being ironed out with upgrades over an extended period.“The SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) will be commissioned within a month or two. She will then join her sister INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018,” a source told TOI.Parallelly, on the conventional (non-nuclear) warfare front, the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two nuclear-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations, another source said.The initial case was for six such 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ submarines (called SSNs) under `Project-77’ at the SBC. But it was first whittled down to three and now stands at two vessels. It will take at least a decade to build the first two SSNs, which will be around 95% indigenous, while the next four will be approved at a later stage, the source said.As per long-standing approved plans, India requires at least 18 diesel-electric submarines, four SSBNs and six SSNs to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan, which is also turning collusive in the maritime domain after the land borders.The country, however, currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurized light-water reactor at its core, and 16 diesel-electric submarines. Moreover, the conventional underwater combat fleet consists of six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, apart from six new French-origin Scorpenes.China, in contrast, already has 60 submarines, and is fast building more. Its fleet includes six Jin-class SSBNs, armed with JL-3 missiles that have a strike range of 10,000 km, and six SSNs.INS Arighat will to a certain extent strengthen India’s weakest leg of the nuclear triad, or the capability to fire nukes from land, air and sea. The land and air vectors, with the Agni ballistic missiles and fighters with nuclear gravity bombs, are relatively more robust.While INS Arighat will also be armed with 750-km range K-15 missiles like INS Arihant, she can carry a larger number of them. The real teeth will come when the third SSBN, the slightly larger 7,000-tonne INS Aridhaman with 3,500-km range K-4 missiles, is commissioned next year.The fourth SSBN, which will be able to carry more K-4 missiles, is also being constructed under the secretive Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched decades ago. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors.Bigger SSBNs with longer-range missiles will give India’s deterrence posture greater credibility because they are the most secure and survivable platforms for assured retaliatory strikes after a first-strike by an adversary.The SSNs, in turn, are critical because they can discreetly operate at high speeds for long distances while remaining submerged for extended periods to take out enemy targets unlike diesel-electric submarines that have to surface or “snorkel” every few days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.Till the indigenous SSNs roll out, India is slated to get an advanced Akula-class SSN on lease from Russia in 2026 under the $3 billion deal inked in Mar 2019, as reported by TOI earlier.","The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat is ‘fully ready’ for formal commissioning after extensive trials. The project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast- expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112437078,imgsize-32966,width-400,resizemode-4/112437078.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The semi-nude body of a second-year post-graduate female trainee doctor was found on August 9 (Friday) at R G Kar Medical College in Kolkata. Her body was recovered on Friday morning at 7:30 from a seminal hall of the hospital's emergency building.""Her body was found in the seminar hall at the emergency building by fellow students who informed us,"" a senior police officer said.The victim was on duty when the incident occured on Thursday night.Police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the murder case and arrested a suspect, Sanjay Roy, on Saturday.Here's what we know so far about the incident:After an initial investigation, the police said that it was a case of murder. However, the victim's father alleged that her daughter was sexually assaulted before she was murdered. “I know that my daughter will never return. But let there be a proper investigation in the matter,” he said.The body bore injury marks with the clothes not in a proper condition. The body was sent for post-mortem examination. A preliminary post-mortem report also confirmed that the girl was raped and murdered inside the hospital. The report detailed numerous injuries on the victim's body. The report said, ""There was bleeding from both her eyes and mouth and injuries over the face. The victim was also bleeding from her private parts. She also has injuries in her belly, left leg... neck, in her right hand, ring finger and... lips."" A broken collar bone was also documented.Kolkata Police said they were waiting for the final post-mortem examination report to come to a conclusion regarding the murder. ""We are waiting for the final autopsy report to come to a conclusion in this case,"" a police officer was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Kolkata Police arrested an accused, Sanjay Roy, on Saturday. The accused was charged under sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of BNS and was produced before Sealdah court, which remanded him to police custody till August 23.Based on circumstantial evidence and statements provided by doctors who were on night duty, the suspect has been charged with rape and murder, as stated by Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal.Goyal while addressing the media, said, ""This is a heinous crime, and the arrested person is allegedly involved based on circumstantial evidence, including accounts of the other doctors present during night-duty hours.""Goyal said the force will ensure that the accused gets the maximum punishment if the charges are proved in court.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, vowed on Saturday to seek the death penalty for the individual accused of the horrific sexual assault and murder. The announcement followed the swift arrest of the suspect.Despite her well-known opposition to the BJP's demands for central agency investigations into various corruption cases in Bengal, Banerjee stated that her administration would not object to a CBI probe if the students and the victim's family requested it.""If they do not trust the West Bengal government, they can approach any investigating agency; we have no objection,"" she said.Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up. Roy, a civic volunteer, was recruited in 2019. Civic volunteers assist police officers in non-law enforcement capacities.Despite receiving compensation from the state, these volunteers are not formally recognized as members of the police force. Having been frequently assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital, Roy had unrestricted access to all departments within the hospital.His undoing was a damaged earphone discovered in the seminar room located on the third floor of the emergency building, where the body of the doctor was found in the early hours of Friday.CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4 am, wearing a Bluetooth device in his ears. However, when he departed the building after 40 minutes, the earphone was no longer present. According to the police, the device subsequently connected to Roy's mobile phone.Massive protests have erupted among junior doctors and medical professionals in medical colleges and hospitals across the West Bengal following the alleged rape and murder in Kolkata. Junior doctors, including interns, housestaff and postgraduate trainees held protest sit-ins and processions at state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, National Medical College and Hospital and Medical College, Kolkata.The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) has declared a nationwide suspension of elective services in hospitals on Monday, August 12, in solidarity with the state-run RG Kar Medical College residentsGovernment hospitals in Delhi have also announced an indefinite strike starting Monday, suspending all elective services in a show of solidarity and anger over the incident.Official statements released by multiple government hospitals in Delhi on Sunday confirmed the closure of outpatient departments (OPDs), operation theatres (OTs), and ward duties, effective Monday morning. The strike aims to pressure authorities to address the safety concerns of healthcare workers and ensure justice for the victim.Medical professionals in Kerala, including doctors, postgraduate students, and educators, have also announced that they will stage demonstrations at government medical colleges throughout the state on Monday.The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association (KGMCTA) vehemently denounced the horrific crime on Sunday.In a statement, the association said, ""The safety of women doctors, who are part of the night duty and emergency department duty work, has always been a matter of concern.""","The semi-nude body of a second-year female trainee doctor was found on August 9 (Friday) at R G Kar Medical College in Kolkata.

Clarity must be provided on this matter. It needs a thorough probe. At the govt level, helipads were constructed wherever the helicopter landed, and govt funds were used. He (Pandian) visited 400-450 places. It is not clear who authorized this and how the authorization was issued. A department secretary does not have the authority to use helicopters. How, then, was permission granted?” asked Harichandan. Pandian was the 5T secretary at the time.Harichandan, also the works minister, added that BJP govt will include everything in the investigation. “After the investigation is complete, we will consider the appropriate punishment,” he told reporters.Odisha Soochana Adhikar Abhijan, a group of RTI activists, staged a demonstration on July 24, alleging misuse of helicopters and chartered flights by Pandian, who took voluntary retirement from IAS in October and joined BJD the following month. He campaigned extensively for the party in Lok Sabha and assembly elections.In response to the ministers’ calls for an investigation into the helicopter rides, BJD functionary Sambit Routray said, “BJP and Congress functionaries should focus on whether there has been development across the state.

Do we want farm labourers to be earning (low) farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade? No, that's not a job. It's servitude, but it’s a necessity today.. we can change the nature of those jobs. Vinod Khosla

How should AI be regulated? There are differing views on this.

What do you think about the future of entrepreneurship as an individual passion, and startup as a business in India?

Risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India--it’s less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India. Vinod Khosla

Should the government play a role in setting up a large fund itself?

You were one the earliest backers of Sam Altman. What prompted you to invest in Open AI?

We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. Sam Altman is doing it with Gen AI. He was a big part of my belief in AI. Vinod Khosla

Dependence on technology is also creating a lazy workforce at a time when India needs to reap benefits from the demographic dividend...

Technology can't override centuries-old human motivations: Vinod Khosla

You have worked closely with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus who is heading the transition government in Bangladesh. What are your hopes for him and the country?

What is your assessment of his ability to sort out the issues in Bangladesh?

On July 22 you had an exchange with Elon Musk on X which was one of the most mature exchanges of views that Musk has had on US politics...

Between the perils of tomorrow and promise of tomorrow,has always bet on the latter. That’s why billionaire founder of Khosla Ventures, who describes himself as a ‘techno-optimist with caring & empathy’, is busy convincing the world of an AI-powered future that can be good for all. Among the first investors in Open AI--and several Indian AI startups--Khosla spoke toofon a host of issues ranging from AI to startups to Mohammand Yunus and Elon Musk. Here’s an edited excerpt:Let’s look at a couple of different aspects of AI. From the national security point of view, governments want to be in control of their AI destiny, not be dependent on foreign algorithms. This is why we invested in Sarvam in India. Because India should have a national AI champion. We have invested in a company called Sakana in Japan.Japan has already announced doubling its national defence budget. They made it clear that AI be a Japanese AI, so they have control over it. Sovereignty and AI are important at a level people don’t quite understand.I would like to see a primary care physician for every Indian, available 24/7, for free as part of the set of digital services the government offers. Aadhaar was the first example of such a service. The hardest part of that service was identity, and that’s already done. With UPI payments are done too. There’s no reason not to add other digital services -- the two most important ones are a free tutor for every child and a free primary care doctor for every citizen of the country.I would like to send a clear message to the Indian government that AI educators, AI teachers for every child in India would cost far, far less than today’s schools and provide much more personalised instruction. Similarly, AI primary care doctors could scale primary care and health far better than any other way.None of these are hard technologies in today's context of AI, and we are working on both. If the Indian government wanted to take and offer it as their service, we would give them all the technology for free.There’s no agenda here. I’d give them all the technology for free, so it becomes a government service, and nobody has any questions about what the agenda is, other than these services should be available to every Indian and every Indian child and even adult education. It's very, very doable in the very short term, and I mean two to five years max.My wife is in India right now, talking about our free AI tutor (CK-12 tutor). One way is to just take it over. It's used in many countries already. It's being translated into 120 different languages. I'm fine if they develop it inside India and take it over and have a starting point that's useful today.Kids using this tutor do better. Turns out it's not only cheaper, but also substantially better. It can teach each kid at the level at which they are, in their language, in a way that the kid will understand best. For example, the same physics concept can be explained using the analogy of cricket or dance depending on which kid understands better with what analogy. You can generate AI explanations in real time, generate the content so it looks more interesting, though it's teaching the same concept.An AI tutor would change the level and method of teaching depending on each student’s level of understanding. If they're not keeping up with the class. Teach them in simpler steps, change the language…I really hope this becomes a national agenda in India. We would give the technology. The content is already there. I think fairly large chunks are translated into the Indian context. It's relatively lightweight to launch it as part of the digital public infrastructure.Digital public infrastructure should include payments, which are basic financial services everybody needs. It should include education. It should include primary healthcare. You can then expand it to others. This can be done, and it can be done philanthropically.In India we started ‘10 Bed ICU’ during Covid, because ICUs were not available in most parts of rural India. I donated the first couple of 100 to remote areas and we wanted to cover all 700 remote districts in India. It’s working really, really well.AI lets you take an unskilled person and teach them very quickly how to do skilled tasks, because the expertise sits in the AI. A 10-bed ICU is a very simple version of it, typically under the supervision of a regional hospital. A hospital in Manipur would cover the remote areas around it. It’s just the beginning of what is really possible.Yes, if you need an MRI, you are going to go to a city to get an MRI. But for simpler things like even an ultrasound can be done by an AI. You don’t need an ultrasound technician anymore. You can buy these devices for Rs 50,000 rupees. Of course, there’s expensive ones too, but small handheld, portable ones are becoming inexpensive and adapted to the Indian environment. All 6 lakh, however many villages there are, should have one. In fact, these diagnostics can be put in one van -- blood test, ultrasound, ECG...We have a company called Alivecor that sells ECG machines in the US for $99. They diagnose without a cardiologist 35 different cardiology conditions with AI. It’s FDA approved. Most of cardiology can be done with a simple device, and you don't need expertise, and expertise is what’s expensive. The cardiologist is what takes 20 years to train. And so this is the promise that I hope India pivots to rapidly.This is a real issue. Firstly, you can upgrade the skills of India’s youth very quickly with AI. We had a company (that General Electric bought) to teach an Uber driver to do a cardiac ultrasound in a week. It's FDA approved. This is an extension of the idea of an AI tutor, which is where we should start. You can impart skills, which very quickly, can be upgraded so they can participate at a higher level. The countries that do this well will be more competitive than others.Secondly, it’s hard to imagine the kind of abundance we can get (in an AI-driven economy). If GDP grows 10% in real terms for the next 25 years, you can imagine the standard living we can achieve and the kind of surplus we can have to provide income and other support to people for whom transition will be hard.The economy can grow much, much faster, and people can be upskilled much faster. We should think about the transition period. There’s very much Utopia at the other end, but, but there is a transition period, and people will get disrupted.India has schemes for guaranteed work. I think we will have to get guaranteed income.I think it will be absolutely required. I first wrote about it in 2016 that AI will cause great GDP growth, great productivity growth. I ended that piece by saying, we will need to think about universal basic income. It’s very clear to me, it's where it leads, but there will be enough abundance.If we are thinking of the world in 2050 do we want farm labourers to be earning farm wages working in 45 degrees centigrade heat in the fields? No, that's not a job. In my view it's servitude, but it’s a necessity today, and if we can change the nature of those jobs then it’s a good thing.The notion of GDP creation and GDP acceleration is separate from the notion of distribution in the west. It’s a controversial idea… everybody wants low taxes. India is in a much better position to tackle it, things like guaranteed work schemes were a bad idea from an economist point of view when they were enacted. They may not be a bad idea in the world of AI, because they are really ways for redistributing income.I believe there’s some right level of regulation. I was very involved in what President Biden did with what's called the ‘executive order on AI’, and that was the right level to focus it on.The technology is in very early stages. Remember, it was only December of 2022 that ChatGPT was released. It’s so new, most people haven't had time to adjust. And my bet is that in 6-12, months from now, the capability will be substantially better than it is today.Technology is making rapid progress, but, you know, human beings adjust at their pace, and jobs will take a decade or two to adjust.If you look at my robot prediction (over a billion robots that will do most of the low-value labour work done today), it’s like creating a business larger than the auto industry globally. How long does that take to put in place? A long time. So the physical world moves at a different pace, even with technology like robots. We just have to recognize that these things have to be managed and managed closely. Regulation may need to protect certain people.The venture business in the US is very different what’s what’s called the private equity business, which is the investing business, where you run spreadsheets and you calculate rates of return. We just bet on big ideas and we bet on technological risk. India’s startup system has been closer to private equity than real risk taking.If you need a physics invention or an AI algorithm invented, you don’t know you can do it when you start. So, risk taking is very different from the financial venture ecosystem in India. It is less risk taking and more focused on growth investments. I hope we start to get to more fundamental risk taking in India.I don’t think governments should be in this business. It’s too dynamic a business for governments.Look, there are so many good ideas. People don’t try them, and when they try them, you need certain types of special individuals to make them happen. These things don’t happen because some academic made a forecast. They happen because one person decides to change things.When Elon Musk said, I will build an electric car, every major automaker in the world had given up on it. In fact, the department of energy here did a forecast for the number of electric cars in 2035 which Elon Musk (Tesla) exceeded in 2016 itself.So, big companies and institutions don't do these things. We have to find somebody who has a vision and can make that happen. Mukesh Ambani did that with Jio. He said, I will lay fibre... I don’t care about the market. Everybody thought it was a stupid 10 billion investment. He just made it happen. So it takes individuals, and Sam was a big part of my belief in AI.The one problem technology will not solve is human motivation. If there’s an easier way, humans tend to take it. I am not sure we should say technology will solve every problem, because human motivations will not change. They haven’t changed for the last 500 years. In the new context, they're presented differently, but personal self interest has always been the case. Less work and more goods has always been something people strive for.I have been to Bangladesh and over the last three to six months, I have been in touch with him (Yunus) and all of his people and writing in support of him when he was being put in jail. I was very much advocating he not be sent to jail, which the then prime minister had wanted to do. I was very much part of the process of trying to give it enough visibility so he doesn’t get sent to jail.Most of it is through public relations influence. There was a full paid ad in the New York Times. Richard Branson and I and a few others funded that. It was much less with the government itself, much more general public pressure and visibility, which obviously autocrats don’t love.It's not my area of expertise. I have been there, I have talked to him a lot. I know he is a caring man, and we have gotten to know him over the years and his foundation. But as to the status of the country, it's very hard to say. As far as I can tell Yunus has said that he has no interest in being in politics, so it is very unlikely he will play a role other than the interim role. He is mostly interested in helping the transition and getting out of the way, and hopefully we will see democratic elections.My interaction with him on Twitter was the most rational discourse I have seen. It was not emotional. It was rational. It got close to 14 or 15 million views because it was rational.Elon is an emotional person, so his comments on the UK riots, I don’t know why he's wading into that. Obviously, he is not doing it because he has an agenda. He has nothing to gain from that.On the question of liberal views versus sort of super conservative views. I don’t think he is particularly religious, so it's not like he’s a religious conservative. I do think there’s a personal side of him that rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, because of the situation with one of his children. I think that's where it goes into the emotional domain as opposed to the logical domain of what’s good for progress, what's good for government. He is a very smart guy, obviously.",Vinod Khosla is one of the first investors in Open AI and several Indian AI startups.

Kolkata doctor rape-murder case: Delhi resident doctors to halt elective services indefinitely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/kolkata-doctor-rape-murder-case-delhi-resident-doctors-to-halt-elective-services-indefinitely/articleshow/112449784.cms,"TimesView The rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata is undoubtedly horrific. But for Delhi government doctors to suspend elective procedures indefinitely in response to the incident is difficult to justify. Neither the government of Delhi nor the patients of the Capital are in any way responsible for the incident or involved in determining the official response to it. And it isn’t as if no action has been taken against the accused. So why hold the Capital to ransom?

NEW DELHI: Resident doctors at major govt hospitals across Delhi are set to indefinitely halt all elective services starting Monday to protest the brutal rape and murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata. They are demanding immediate action in the case and measures to ensure protection for all healthcare workers.President of the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), Dr Aviral Mathur said safety of doctors must be prioritised to allow them to continue their crucial work without fear.“We can no longer stand by while our safety is compromised. The recent horrific rape and murder of a fellow doctor on hospital premises is the final straw,” he said. “We are initiating an indefinite strike, in coordination with other doctor associations of the national capital, from Monday to demand immediate action and protection for all healthcare workers. Our ability to care for patients hinges on our own safety being ensured,” he added.Dr Bharani Kumar, president of the resident doctors’ associations (RDA) at Delhi’s Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, said they have decided to shut down elective services, including OPD, elective surgeries and ward duties starting Monday. “We are deeply grieved by this heinous crime and demand an immediate, transparent investigation with severe punishment for those responsible,” he said. “The govt must swiftly implement the ‘Central Protection Act for Doctors’ and enhance security measures across hospitals nationwide, including installation of CCTV cameras in high-risk areas. Today it happened in Bengal, tomorrow it could be Delhi, or any other part of the nation,” he added.RDAs of Maulana Azad Medical College, RML Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and GTB Hospital have also announced the suspension of elective services.The body of the 32-year-old woman was found on Thursday night in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College & Hospital. Kolkata Police on Saturday arrested the accused under Sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of the BNS and produced him before Sealdah court, which remanded him in police custody till Aug 23.Deen Dayal Upadhyaya RDA president Dr Vipin K Madhogarhia said in a statement, “We extend our full support in the pursuit of justice for our fellow doctor in the face of this heinous crime. Together, we stand united in this hour of need... As a mark of solidarity with our colleagues at RG Kar, we announce a nationwide suspension of elective services in hospitals starting August 12. This decision is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure that our voices are heard and that the demands for justice and safety are addressed without further delay.”On Saturday, several resident doctors’ associations held a candlelight march, demanding an immediate and thorough investigation as well as a CBI inquiry into the incident.",Delhi government doctors to suspend elective procedures indefinitely in response to the incident is difficult to justify.

AAP, meanwhile, demanded PM Narendra Modi’s resignation over the issue.SP chief too wrote on X: “There should be a historical investigation of Sebi because the history of Sebi has been such that it has never become the true protector and support of investors. Only an impartial investigation can restore Sebi’s reputation to instill a sense of security in investing in the Indian markets. ”Kharge, calling Adani a close associate of PM Modi, reminded that Sebi had previously cleared the billionaire businessman following the Hindenburg report allegations in Jan 2023. He said, “A JPC inquiry is imperative to investigate this massive scandal. Until then, concerns persist that PM Modi will continue to shield his ally, compromising India’s constitutional institutions, painstakingly built over seven decades.”Party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said the SC expert panel had noted that the Sebi had shown strange reluctance to probe the Adani ‘MegaScam’, while underlining that the Sebi had in 2018 diluted, and in 2019 entirely deleted, the reporting requirements relating to the ultimate beneficial ownership of foreign funds, which tied the hands of the expert panel and led to Sebi’s failure to reach to the bottom of the irregularities.AAP’s Sanjay Singh, demanding a JPC, said, “Any statement or report made by the Sebi chief in the SC on Adani’s probe has no meaning. The Court should take cognisance of this, because the truth has been hidden from it.”Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate asked if the govt curtailed the Budget session of Parliament because it was aware of the impending release of Hindenburg report.","Alleged quid pro quo between Adani Group and Sebi chief Madhabi Buch following fresh Hindenburg claims.

Rain fury claims 30 lives in 4 northern states; 5 missing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rain-fury-claims-30-lives-in-4-northern-states-5-missing/articleshow/112449821.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rain fury in the north left 31 people dead on Sunday across Rajasthan , Himachal, UP and Punjab, where nine from an extended family were washed away after their car sank in a stream. At least eight people were missing in the four states.Rajasthan, especially Jaipur and Bharatpur, bore the brunt of the monsoon misery, with 17 deaths and five people missing.The five had gone for a dip at Kanota dam in Jaipur.In Bharatpur, seven young men posing for reels near the Banganga fell into the river and lost their lives after ground beneath them caved in. Three youths drowned in a rain-fed pond in Jhunjhunu after getting stuck in sludge. In Karauli district, which witnessed a flood-like situation with record rainfall of 380mm on Sunday, a man and his 10-year-old son Jia were killed when a portion of a neighbour’s house collapsed on their home.Jodhpur reported five deaths, including that of a 17-year-old who drowned in Koilana lake during a trekking trip.The heavy rainfall caused widespread damage and disruption throughout Rajasthan. CM Bhajan Lal Sharma reviewed the situation on Sunday and instructed officials to provide timely assistance to the affected.In Punjab’s Hoshiarpur, the nine died when their Innova was negotiating a seasonal stream at Jaijon Doaba village on the border with Himachal Pradesh. According to some locals, the SUV driver apparently misjudged the depth of the stream after watching a bulldozer wade in and cross it. A teen was rescued but two were still missing. The victims were part of a group of 12 relatives headed to a wedding in Hoshiarpur from Himachal’s Una district.“The strong flow swept the Innova away. Two-three of us immediately rushed to get a rope and the bulldozer driver tried to reach them, but he had to fall back due to the swift currents. Those inside the vehicle were washed away, but a teenaged boy was pushed to the side of the stream and we pulled him out,” said Manoj Kumar Sharma, a villager.According to Sharma, he could see the others being washed away but could do nothing. “Five bodies were found around 1km away, caught in bushes, and four were fished out later,” he said. Hoshiarpur DC Komal Mittal said NDRF teams were searching for the two missing.In Himachal Pradesh, three girls died and one person was missing after landslides and flash floods over the last two days. This led to the closure of more than 280 roads. Officials said 458 power and 48 water supply schemes were affected.In Uttar Pradesh’s Jalaun, a woman and her seven-year-old son died after the roof of their house collapsed in the district’s Koch area following heavy rain.","Rajasthan, especially Jaipur and Bharatpur, bore the brunt of the monsoon misery, with 17 deaths and five people missing.

Natwar: From Congress’ ‘charmed circle’ to persona non grata,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/natwar-from-congress-charmed-circle-to-persona-non-grata/articleshow/112450066.cms,"NEW DELHI:

He could have been anything and he did become everything. A royal who wore many hats and a diplomat who was witty and also excelled at arts and letters. A politician who had the free pass as someone “close” to four generations of the Gandhi family , starting with Nehru. Natwar Singh achieved so much and more, that his death could have been a glowing celebration across partisan lines.But when Singh did depart at the ripe age of 93, he was remembered as a bitter man who had a sad falling out with the Gandhi family, with a cloud of corruption over his head, and his counter charges against Congress and its leadership. And, as a man who shook hands with “communal forces” out of personal pique.Singh’s journey from Congress towards BJP dominated his obituaries, when the man could have been toasted just for the breadth of his experiences, nicely compressed in his book ‘Profiles and Letters’ about his elite acquaintances, that included EM Forster and Rajagopalachari.Singh was a member of the Congress’s “charmed circle”, since he joined politics and became an MP and minister in 1984, after a rich life as diplomat of IFS who had served key postings in China, the US, Pakistan and the UK. He was close to Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and then to Sonia Gandhi. But the dominant and defining chapter of his life came with the Volcker Report and the allegations about his having benefitted from ‘Oil for Food’ programme of the UN by using his acquaintance with then Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein. That sparked a furore under the initial days of the UPA govt led by Manmohan Singh. Interestingly, the timing of the case in 2001 was when Congress was in the opposition and Singh was the head of the party’s foreign affairs cell.Aniel Matherani, who in 2005 was ambassador to Croatia, and two other Congressmen were said to have gone to Iraq as part of the party delegation. Matherani laid the blame on Singh, and “corroborated” the allegations that the veteran had laid the ground for benefitting his son and son’s friend. Singh contested the claims and pointed out that Congress too was named in the annexures of the Volcker report.Singh left the govt and the party, and quickly turned into a paraiah. The Justice RS Pathak Committee was, as was reported, said to have fixed the responsibility with Singh. He always countered the view and insisted that he had been exonerated, as per his interviews and press reports.From charmed circle to persona non grata, Singh lived his later years with bitterness, his comments about Sonia Gandhi, and even barbs at other members of the family betraying his peeve.On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge paid tributes to Singh, writing on X: “Our deepest condolences on the passing away of Former Union minister K Natwar Singh. An acclaimed intellectual and a Padma Bhushan recipient, he made a profound contribution to India’s diplomacy and external affairs. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and followers.”Praising his personality and achievements, Jairam Ramesh said, “He was truly someone who has left behind his ‘footprints on the sands of time’.”","Natwar Singh achieved so much and more, that his death could have been a glowing celebration across partisan lines.

The monsoon session of Parliament was scheduled to end on Monday but was cut short by one working day and ended on Friday.BJP leader and former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said Hindenburg had attacked Sebi in an “obvious partnership” with Congress and had an ominous motive. “It is to destabilise and discredit one of the world’s strongest financial systems and create chaos in the world’s fastest-growing economy,” he said on X.“I have said often and say again, many global forces with the help of the Congress dynasty want to slow down or trip up India’s rise. We won’t let them,” he said.Hindenburg Research on Saturday launched a broadside against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch, alleging she and her husband had stakes in obscure offshore funds used in the alleged Adani money siphoning scandal.Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too claimed Congress was behind the Hindenburg report.“Congresss work is only to spread anarchy and entangle the country in controversial matters,” he said. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP workers were carrying the “torch of development and progress”, whereas Congress has been trying to mislead the country and keep it in the dark for years.The Adani group also termed the allegations malicious and based on manipulation of select public information.

As Adam Piece came forward to state, “Our medical staff has informed me that Seth Rollins has in fact suffered several cracked ribs and internal bruising, and as such will be out of action for an unspecified period of time.” He further stated, “ Bronson Reed, the cause of this last Monday on ‘Raw’ has been fined a massive yet undisclosed amount of money, which he has appealed. And I do not expect that Mr. Reed will be happy when I deny that appeal.”It all started with the SummerSlam “grudge match” where Rollins was invited as their special guest referee.

Subsequently, Punk held a grudge with Rollins which he intended to settle in the last match.With Rollin currently being out of action for an indefinite while, Punk and McIntyre would be left to continue their feud and settle it in future matches.
