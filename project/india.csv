Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.","The government is evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.

For school and college students, July is a month of new beginnings. After the summer vacations that typically end in June, students return to school, ready to embark on a new academic journey. This period also coincides with the onset of the monsoon season in many Indian states.In terms of holidays, July has relatively few school breaks.Schools may declare holidays for special occasions, with Muharram being a notable one. Including weekends, students can expect a total of five off-days in July.Here's an overview-Muharram holds deep historical importance for both Sunni and Shia Muslims, as it commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. This event, marked by the Day of Ashura on the tenth day of Muharram, is a time of mourning and reflection for the Muslim community. Muharram also marks the beginning of the new Islamic year.","Schools may declare holidays for special occasions, with Muharram being a notable one.

"July 23 Budget to focus on infrastructure, targeted spending",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/july-23-budget-to-focus-on-infra-targeted-spending/articleshow/111546831.cms,"NEW DELHI: The first Budget of Narendra Modi ’s third term will be presented on July 23 amid indications that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will use the revenue growth and record dividend from Reserve Bank of India to spend not just on capital expenditure for creating infrastructure but also use the resources at its disposal to focus on specific target groups such as the middle class, women and farm sector.While the economy has so far been performing well, govt also wants to use the Budget to announce some reform measures that do not need legislative approval.“Hon’ble President of India, on the recommendation of Govt of India, has approved the proposal for summoning of both the Houses of Parliament for the budget session, 2024 from 22nd July, 2024 to 12 August, 2024 (subject to exigencies of parliamentary business). Union Budget 2024-25 will be presented in Lok Sabha on 23 July, 2024,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said in a post on X.The Economic Survey for the last financial year, which is also due, is likely to be tabled in Parliament on the opening day, outlining the Modi govt’s achievements during the first two terms and identifying the focus areas. It remains to be seen if govt releases its much-talked 100 days’ agenda before the Budget is tabled since the elements in the plan will feed into the announcements.Sitharaman, who will present her seventh consecutive Budget — a record that overtakes Morarji Desai’s six, will seek to address critical concerns around inflation, jobs, income inequality and regional imbalances while announcing tax measures and other social security benefits targeted at the middle class.Having posted a better-than-budgeted fiscal deficit thanks to buoyant tax collections, Sitharaman and her team are being watched if govt intends to speed up the move towards a 4.5% fiscal deficit. Against revised estimates of 5.8% of GDP last year, the Centre closed the year with a deficit of 5.6%. For the current fiscal year, the govt had set a target of 5.1% and therevenue mop-up so far is expected to help it achieve the target, especially amid projections that GDP growth may turn out to be higher than the budgeted level.Sitharaman, who has been conservative in her estimates, may, however, use some of the receipts for spending to ensure that the Indian economy , which is expected to grow 7% this year, remains resilient in the medium term by investing in areas that need attention.","The first Budget of Narendra Modi ’s third term will be presented on July 23. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will use the revenue growth and record dividend from Reserve Bank of India to spend.

"Eye on China, desi light tank Zorawar to be ready by 2027",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-desi-light-tank-zorawar-to-be-ready-by-2027/articleshow/111544031.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's very own light tank , designed under ' Project Zorawar ' for high-altitude warfare in places like eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh , is expected to be ready for induction into the Army by 2027.The light tank, developed by DRDO and private sector company L&T, will have to undergo a series of summer and winter trials, including in deserts and high-altitude areas, over the next two to three years before the entire acquisition, production and induction process can actually begin.The need for such tanks, each weighing around 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now.Reviewing the first prototype of the light tank at Hazira in Gujarat on Saturday, DRDO chairperson Samir Kamat told journalists it was ""a momentous day"" to see it in action. The prototype, designed and developed in a short period of 24 to 30 months, is an example of what can be achieved when the DRDO and industry work together. The light tank should be ready for induction, after ""developmental and user (Army) trials"", by 2027, he added.The Army's case for 354 such tanks, which will cost an estimated Rs 17,500 crore, was given preliminary approval or ""acceptance of necessity"" by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council in Dec 2022.While 59 of these light tanks are reserved for DRDO, which has L&T as the ""lead system integrator"", the rest 295 are to be manufactured under the govt-funded design and development 'Make-1' category, which is open to companies other than L&T as well, as was first reported by TOI.A DRDO official said the agile and versatile light tank will be capable of operations in the ""most challenging environment in the world with minimal logistic support"", including high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China.""Due to its lighter weight, the tank has high strategic mobility. It can be transported by air and is capable of amphibious operations. It can fire at high angles of elevation and perform the role of limited artillery,"" he added.The over 11-lakh strong Army had managed to deploy some of its heavier Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation with China erupted in May 2020. The PLA also inducted a large number of technologically advanced mix of medium and light tanks, including the new third-generation Type-15 ones.The T-90S and T-72 tanks, however, are geared for operations in plains and deserts, and thereby have limitations in high-altitude areas ranging from 11,000 to almost 17,000-feet. ""Consequently, the need arose for light tanks that are more manoeuvrable and operationally flexible in mountains,"" an officer said.","The light tank, developed by DRDO and private sector company L&T, will have to undergo a series of summer and winter trials, including in deserts and high- altitude areas.

Counselling for NEET-UG to begin after July 3rd week: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/counselling-for-neet-ug-to-begin-after-july-3rd-week-government/articleshow/111547109.cms,"NEW DELHI: NEET-UG counselling , the process for allotment of seats to successful candidates based on their exam score, will start after the third week of July, govt said on Saturday.The clarification came in the wake of allegations that the govt had deferred the counselling process, which was scheduled to commence on Saturday.

For the year 2024, NMC has communicated its schedule for finalisation of the seat matrix for UG and PG seats in the last week of June, indicating that it will finalise the UG seat matrix by third week of July and PG seat matrix by mid-August. MCC will accordingly notify the counselling schedules.”The NEET seat matrix provides students with information regarding the state-wise distribution of seats, cutoff scores, and courses each medical institution provides.The NEET-UG exam has been mired in controversy this year due to an alleged paper leak.

The next hearing on the matter is likely on Monday.Sources said pendency of the case could be one of the reasons behind the delay in announcement of the NEET-UG counselling schedule. Normally, when a matter is sub judice and the case is likely to be taken up in the coming few days, the govt and its authorities prefer to wait for the court’s hearing.There are approximately 1.2 lakh undergraduate medical seats across govt and private medical colleges in the country. This year, more than 23 lakh students appeared for NEET-UG, which was held on May 5. The results were declared on June 4.

Integration with drones and battle management systems for enhanced situational awareness

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) tested out its light battle tank Zorawar in Gujarat's Hazira on Saturday.Zorawar has been developed jointly by the DRDO and Larsen and Toubro . The tank project being developed for the Indian Army was reviewed by DRDO chief Dr Samir V Kamat.""It's indeed a momentous day for all of us to see the light tank in action.It makes me happy and proud. It's indeed an example ... in a short period of two years to two and a half years, we have not only designed this tank but made a first prototype and now the first prototype will undergo development trials over the next six months, and then we will be ready to offer it to our users for user trials .... Zorawar is expected to be inducted into the Indian Army by 2027 after all trials,"" said Kamat.The tank has been developed by the DRDO to meet the Indian Army’s requirements in the eastern Ladakh sector to counter the Chinese deployment across the Line of Actual Control.The tank with its lightweight and amphibious capabilities can travel through steep climbs in mountains and cross rivers and other water bodies much more easily than the heavy-weight T-72 and T-90 tanks. As per the DRDO chief, the tank is expected to be inducted into the Indian Army by 2027.Commenting on the unique features of Zorawar, ⁠DRDO tank lab director Rajesh Kumar said, ""Generally there are three different types of tanks. There are three categories depending on the weight. The heavy tanks, the medium tanks and the light tanks. Each one has its role. One is for protection, one is for offence and these light tanks play a mixed role. What is unique about this tank is the weight as well as the combination of the fundamental parameters of a tank, which is the fire, power, mobility and protection. All three are optimized in such a way that the weight is also maintained. At the same time, you are getting all the parameters.""The Zorawar is a light-tank designed to provide the Indian Army with enhanced capabilities in high-altitude areas like Ladakh. It is named after the 19th century Dogra General Zorawar Singh, who led military expeditions to Ladakh and Western Tibet.The Zorawar is designed to be light, maneuverable, and transportable by air, while still maintaining substantial firepower, protection, surveillance and communication capabilities.It weighs just 25 tons, half the weight of heavier tanks like the T-90, allowing it to operate in difficult mountain terrain that is inaccessible to larger tanks.The Indian Army has placed an initial order for 59 Zorawar tanks, with plans to potentially procure a total of 354 light tanks. The Zorawar will help balance the scales against China's existing fleet of lightweight mountain tanks, like the Type 15, which have a significant advantage in the high altitudes of Ladakh.The induction of the Zorawar light tank will provide the Indian Army with a critical capability to rapidly deploy and maneuver in the high-altitude regions of Ladakh and other border areas. Its combination of mobility, firepower and advanced systems will enhance India's overall military posture against China in these strategically important sectors.","The Zorawar is a light-tank designed to provide the Indian Army with enhanced capabilities in high-altitude areas like Ladakh.

Brand Buddha & A Superfood Rice

From Lucknow to London and Dumraon to Dubai, connoisseurs of food still talk about the legend of kalanamak rice, named so because of its black husk.Known for its extraordinary fragrance that is said to have drawn herds of deer out of jungle and a lightness that would allow one to gorge on it and yet never feel full, kalanamak rice was once quintessential part of dinner time stories shared at dastarkhwans of Awadh and in the royal kitchens of Banaras. But as decades went by and human greed gave way to guile, the elusive rice variety – known particularly for its health benefits – lost its acreage as much as it lost its famed qualities and gradually confined itself to myths and stories. Efforts of a few dedicated individuals, including scientists, and the Uttar Pradesh government led to the revival of the elusive rice variety in the past two decades.It was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2013 which recognized Siddharth Nagar and the adjacent districts as the area where it is grown. Later, under the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme, kalanamak rice was exported from Siddharth Nagar district to Singapore and a few other Asian destinations. The rice variety also earned the Prime Minister’s award for Excellence in Public Administration 2021 and featured in the book ‘Speciality Rice of the World’ by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.It’s heartening to see that a lost rice variety has finally made it to many organic outlets. It is also available on Amazon and other online platforms. And yet, the pricey packs you stumble upon in fancy outlets or online are more likely to leave you wanting. Counterfeit and adulteration are rampant as little is known or understood about kalanamak rice. This writer travelled to the remote locations associated with the cultivation and history of this rice variety and spoke to scientists, academicians and farmers to bring you the truth straight from the farm.Kalanamak, known as kalonunia in Bengal where it is regarded as the ‘prince of rice’ and is often used in veneration, has a history directly connected to Lord Buddha.The history of rice cultivation in India is as old as agriculture itself. While the first evidence of agriculture is found in Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan’s Balochistan, where wheat, cotton and barley seeds were conclusively discovered by archaeologists, first variety of wild rice were found closer home in Uttar Pradesh, in the Belan river valley of Prayagraj district. While Mehrgarh is dated approximately 8000-6000BC, carbon dating of rice grains established 7000 BC as the time of rice cultivation in Koldihwa and Mahagara archaeological sites, both on the opposite banks of Belan river, in Prayagraj district. Both sites are earliest examples of oryza sativa (Latin for rice cultivation), a rice variety first domesticated in the Yangtze river basin in China 13,500 to 8,200 years ago.In Harappan culture, the site of Lothal has been associated with rice cultivation. The Rig Veda doesn’t mention rice, but Yajura Veda does, where it is often mentioned as ‘dhannya’. Sayana (14th century, Vijayanagar Empire) in his commentary on the Vedas uses the term ‘tandula’ for rice.The Ramayana has several mentions of rice. In the Mahabharata, Krishna gifts a vessel, called akshay patra, to Draupadi that would always be filled with rice.Kalanamak rice made its debut in Indian history with Gautam Buddha in his own land. When Siddhartha returned to his father’s kingdom, Kapilvastu (between the present-day Piparhawa in Siddharth Nagar and Kapilvastu district of Nepal), he was greeted by villagers at a place. According to the account of Chinese traveller Fa Hien (early 5th century), the people of Mathla village, near Bajaha jungle, asked Gautam Buddha for prasad or holy food, and he gave them grains to grow in marshy areas. According to Fa Hein, Buddha famously said, “The rice will carry a fragrance that will remind you of me.”According to farmers, even today, the kalanamak rice variety grown between Bajaha village and Piparhawa – the place where a portion of Gautam Buddha’s ashes were discovered in a relic casket by British engineer and landowner William Claxton Peppé in 1897 – which is merely a distance of around seven kilometres on the Indo-Nepal border, has a distinctly better fragrance and taste than the rice variety grown elsewhere in the region.Piparhawa is just 15 kilometres from Nepal’s Lumbini where an Ashokan pillar marking the site to be Buddha’s birthplace was discovered in 1896.There is little doubt in the fact that kalanamak rice had a direct connection to both Gautam Buddha and his father’s kingdom. According to the GI registry, grains similar to kalanamak were found from excavation sites at Aligarhwa, located on the Nepal border in Siddharth Nagar – identified as the territory of Buddha’s father, king Shuddodhana. The name, Shuddhodhana, in Sanskrit, stands for ‘pure rice’.The accidental discovery of Buddha’s relics by Peppé in 1897 took the world by storm and all details of the findings and related research were compiled in what is now known as the Piparhawa Project. However, it’s intriguing to note that there are little details of what Peppé, an estate manager and private landowner, was doing in Birdpur for a living.According to the Asian-Agri History Foundation, the first effort at conserving kalanamak was made by the British who built reservoirs in the area to increase its production. Besides William Peppé, J H Humphrey, and Edcan Walker (zamindars of Birdpur, Alidapur and Mohana, respectively during the British Raj) led these conservation efforts.They built ten reservoirs in the area to produce kalanamak in large quantities. They not only produced this variety for themselves but to transport it to many countries from the nearby Uska Bazar mandi, passing through Dhaka (now in Bangladesh) via the sea route.Local farmers still point out to irrigation canals dug by these Britishers to ensure water supply to rice cultivators at all times of the year. According to village elders, they would personally ride through villages and monitor that the canals had proper flow of water to be able to reach the fields where kalanamak rice was being grown. As a result of their efforts, the rice variety had also begun to be grown in the neighbouring Basti and Gorakhpur back then.Of these, Peppés had a larger influence, and their name is still part of the local folklore. Their house in Birdpur area is still referred to as ‘sahib ki kothi’ and a larger market town in the region is named after them. Initially called Peppéganj, it has since become Pipiganj. But the British landowners’ interest in kalanamak rice that also brought Marwari merchants to Uska Bazar in pre-Independent India didn’t go down well with farmers who were at the receiving end of their overenthusiasm.Dinesh Chaudhary, a kalanamak rice grower from Siddharth Nagar’s Majhauli village whose ancestors were contract kalanamak cultivators for the British, said, “The British were brutal in their approach and farmers were reluctant to grow this rice variety for them. They would often beat them up if the harvest wasn’t to their satisfaction. But saying no wasn’t an option in the days of the Raj. As a result, growing kalanamak became a symbol of their slavery, something the farmers here gave up soon after Independence.”A local folk song sung by children here in pre-Independent India, which is still at times crooned by village elders, summarises it all.(Oliver sahib plays golf,Peppé sahib checks grain quality;They chase and beat up contract farmers, And what a damn circus it was!)Agriculture scientist Ram Chet Chaudhary, who taught at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University in Pusa, Bihar, before joining the United Nations to lead a team of scientists working on rice production, studied rice cultivation in various parts of the world as part of his job.After his retirement, Chaudhary, who worked closely with MS Swaminathan, returned to Gorakhpur, his native town, and got involved in the conservation and development of kalanamak rice. By that time (1990s), the area of its cultivation had fallen to less than 2000 hectares, from 50,000 hectares at the time of Independence.“Growing kalanamak wasn’t an easy job for the farmers here. The rice variety needs marshy land, and the paddy grows up to a height of six feet which makes it lodge. Only those having land in the terai region could grow this variety and the yield was less and far from profitable,” he said.Chaudhary and his team of scientists examined the carbonized rice grains found in the eastern mound at Piparhawa along with Buddha’s relics.“I wanted to determine the qualities of the original kalanamak rice and match it with the ones that farmers were growing at that time,” Chaudhary said. He began to visit villages between Bajaha and Piparhawa in Siddharth Nagar district to collect seed samples from the farmers engaged in growing this rice variety. After 1998, he collected 250 germplasm (rice samples), characterized these, and selected the best ones for testing at the state government’s regional testing facility.Just one of these samples came close to the ancient rice samples found at Piparhawa. Since it was sample number 3, it was named Kalanamak KN3. “The sample came from a farmer named Phoolchand in Ghoswa village, barely 2 km from Mathla village in Bajaha where Buddha is said to have given seeds to farmers as prasad,” Chaudhary said.Phoolchand’s ancestors were engaged in cultivation of this variety. They were also enrolled by the Peppé family to grow rice for them. “Traditionally, our ancestors used seeds from their own harvest and never took seeds from anywhere else. This may have preserved our crop against genetic impurities,” Phoolchand said. After years of research, KN 3 was released by the state govt in 2007 and notified by the Centre for cultivation to the farmers in 2010. “Farmers liked the aroma and the grain quality of KN 3 still avoided growing KN 3 as its long strand was prone to bending which affected its yield,” RC Chaudhary said.Chaudhary started working on it to develop a better variety of KN 3 which could be profitable for the farmers at his organisation, Participatory Rural Development Foundation. He crossed KN 3 with an improved Sambha Masuri, another fragrant rice variety, to develop two other rice varieties – Bauna (dwarf) Kalanamak 101 and Bauna Kalanamak 102.These had shorter plant height but were not on a par with KN 3 in terms of fragrance and texture.In 2019, Chaudhary was successful in the notification and official release of Kalanamak Kiran variety which resulted in three-fold yield. Farmers showed readiness as Kalanamak Kiran was profitable and the state govt’s One District One Product (ODOP) and PKVY schemes helped in branding it better. In 2013, Chaudhary’s efforts led to grant of a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the ancient rice variety, signifying its association with 11 districts – Bahraich, Balrampur, Basti, Deoria, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Siddharthnagar and Shrawasti.By 2023, the kalanamak cultivation had increased to 80,000 hectares in these 11 districts.Chaudhary was recently awarded Padma Shri by President Droupadi Murmu for his efforts to conserve this rare rice variety.In 2022, Indian Agriculture Research Institute successfullydeveloped and tested two new dwarf varieties: Pusa Narendra Kalanamak 1638 and Pusa Narendra Kalanamak 1652, in UP.Kalanamak rice is rich in micronutrients such as iron (four-times the normal rice variety) and zinc (16.97ppm). It has 11% protein, almost double that of common rice varieties. It has a low Glycaemic Index (49% to 52%) making it “sugar-free” and suitable for diabetics. Besides, it has low amylose (21%, against 24% in normal rice varieties) and has beta carotene present in its grain (.42mg), something that’s absent in the grains of other rice varieties (according to analysis done at R-FRAC, dept of horticulture, UP. Chaudhary et al., 2021). The central government came out with its Nutri-Farm scheme in 2013, intending to promote food crops that offer critical micronutrients to improve the nutrition status of the vulnerable section of society. Kalanamak rice was the only rice from north India to be selected as a nutri-crop for this scheme. Under the state govt’s ODOP scheme, kalanamak rice was branded as ‘Buddha Home rice’ and exported to Singapore in 2021.The name caught the fancy of Buddhist nations and this rice variety is now being regularly re-exported to Japan, Malaysia, Cambodia, and a few other Southeast Asian countries.A few other measures were also taken at the grassroots level. To address farmers’ issues, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) that nurture the growth of the farmers in the district by providing forward and backward linkages were formed. Each FPO had seed-providers as members which helped them estimate demand so that they could provide adequate supply. A common facility centre for kalanamak processing was developed and farmers were provided linkages for sale on various platforms, including e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart.But with branding came bad practices. Middlemen began to procure rice from farmers, mix them with other rice varieties of similar grain size and sell them in open markets as well as on online platforms. As a result, out of ten packs of kalanamak rice one purchased online or even in stores, nine turned out to be fake, or heavily adulterated. The govt will have to develop a mechanism to check bad practices in kalanamak trade in due course of time.With the extension of kalanamak rice cultivation in 11 districts of eastern UP, the fragrance and texture of the rice have taken a tumble as compared to original KN 3, the heritage rice variety. RC Chaudhary said, “I have heard about such issues. KN 3 is the heritage rice variety with traces of wild rice qualities. Besides, terrain, soil and climate of the particular area each play a part in rice cultivation. Our research is far from over. The good thing is that people are talking about, growing and getting to eat the kalanamak rice variety.” The French used a word for wine quality, ‘terroir’, which is the complete natural environment in which a particular wine is produced, including factors such as the soil, topography, and climate. Perhaps, ‘terroir’ plays a role in kalanamak rice cultivation too. While agricultural research and govt’s efforts have expanded area of cultivation and brought it out of fables to the food tables, the fragrance of Buddha still pervades the land he once walked.","Kalanamak rice was once quintessential part of dinner time stories shared at dastarkhwans of Awadh and in the royal kitchens of Banaras. But as decades went by and human greed gave way to guile, the elusive rice variety – known particularly for its health benefits – lost its acreage. Efforts of a few dedicated individuals, including scientists, and the Uttar Pradesh government led to the revival of the rice variety in the past two decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111547552,imgsize-77284,width-400,resizemode-4/111547552.jpg"

Claiming that some political parties had recently contacted Madhukar, the police said political connections and money trail would be probed and ""strictest possible"" action would be taken if any party is found involved in the activities.""Madhukar was the main organiser of the satsang programme in Fulrai village on July 2 and the permission for this programme was taken by him.Thus, two roles of Madhukar have come to light -- the main organiser and fundraiser,"" Hathras Superintendent of Police Nipun Agarwal said at a press conference.Madhukar is the only accused named in the FIR lodged at Sikandra Rao police station on July 2 after the stampede, and Agarwal said the investigation has revealed that some political parties had contacted him some time back.""A detailed investigation is being conducted regarding the collection of funds to see if such programmes and other resources are being funded by any political party.""From the investigation so far, it appears that some political party is connected with them for its political and personal interests,"" Agarwal said.""All the bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, money trail, related to the accused Devprakash Madhukar are being investigated, in which assistance will be taken from other agencies as per the need,"" he added.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, both former chief ministers, hit out at the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government over the handling of the case.Yadav alleged that ""to hide its failure"" in the Hathras incident, the UP government ""wants to shirk responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of people by making minor arrests"".He also accused the government and administration of ""needlessly arresting people, who were away from the original venue"" with a specific motive and is preparing to hold them guilty after the arrest.""These arrests are a conspiracy in themselves,"" he said on X, demanding an immediate judicial inquiry into the case.BSP chief Mayawati demanded strict action against Bhole Baba and others for the stampede. In a post on X, she urged the poor, Dalit and the oppressed, not to be ""misled by preachers like Bhole Baba"".""Action is also necessary against other such babas. The government should not be lenient due to political interests in this matter, so that no more people lose their lives in the future,"" Mayawati said.Asked if the police would question the preacher after arresting Madhukar, Hathras Superintendent of Police Agarwal said, ""Action would be taken on the basis of further investigation"" in the case.Carrying a Rs 1 lakh bounty, Madhukar, 42, was arrested late Friday from Delhi's Najafgarh area by a Special Operations Group of Hathras police, while two more suspects -- Ramprakash Shakya (61) and Sanju Yadav (33) -- were held locally on Saturday over the episode that left 121 people dead, according to the police.Madhukar and Yadav were later produced before a local magistrate who remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days, while Yadav would be produced in the court on Sunday, an official said. The police had sought their custody for questioning.So far, nine people, including two women and three senior citizens, have been arrested in the case, in which ""several unidentified sevadars (volunteers)"" of the satsang are mentioned as accused. The 'godman' is not an accused in the case.The Hathras SP said Madhukar worked as a fundraiser for events of the self-styled godman Surajpal alias Narayan Sakar Hari alias Bhole Baba and collected donations.""His financial transactions and money trails are being looked into, and call detail records are also being checked,"" Agarwal added.However, Madhukar's lawyer A P Singh claimed that the 'mukhya sevadar' (chief organiser) of the satsang, where the stampede occurred, had himself surrendered to the police in Delhi, where he had come for medical treatment, contradicting the police's claim of having nabbed him on their own.On Saturday, he told PTI Video that while organisers of the event are being arrested, there was also need to nab ""15-16 unidentified, drunk anti-social elements in half pants"" who he claimed triggered the stampede.Singh also questioned the swift issuance of a non-bailable warrant against Madhukar and the declaration of bounty on his arrest, but maintained he has faith in the judicial process and the investigation teams.Meanwhile, the judicial team formed to probe the matter reached Hathras on Saturday afternoon and visited the incident site, among other places. Justice (retired) Brajesh Kumar Srivastava told reporters that the judicial panel's report is mandated to submit its report within two months.Around 2.15 pm on Saturday, Madhukar was brought by the police to the Bagla Combined District Hospital in Hathras for a medical examination amid heavy security deployment in and around the government hospital.The SP said after preliminary interrogation, accused Madhukar said he had been working on contract as a junior engineer in MNREGA in Etah district since 2010. He has been associated with Surajpal's organisation for years and organises programmes, collecting funds for it.Agarwal said the accused and the sevadars/organising committee members working under his direction were ""fully responsible"" for the barricading, entrance gate, exit gate, seating arrangements, parking and other facilities around the pandal of the satsang.""Madhukar and other sevadars prevented the police administration from any kind of interference inside the event venue. At the event venue, his sevadars were looking after all the arrangements in the form of commandos in different costumes,"" he said.""No person was allowed to do videography or photography at the venue. Thus, the arrangements were not done properly and the traffic system etc was affected by violating many conditions mentioned in the permission letter issued by the administration,"" the SP said.After the stampede, an FIR was lodged in the matter on July 2 under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 110 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 126 (2) (wrongful restraint), 223 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by the public servant) and 238 (causing disappearance of evidence).On July 3, the Uttar Pradesh government formed a three-member judicial commission headed by a retired high court judge to probe the tragedy and to look into the possibility of a conspiracy behind the stampede.Simultaneously, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Additional Director General of Police (Agra Zone) Anupam Kulshreshtha is also filing a detailed report on the episode, to be submitted to the UP government.Kulshreshtha on Friday told PTI that the conspiracy angle in the probe has not been ruled out even as the evidence and statements gathered so far suggest culpability on the part of the event organisers.","Devprakash Madhukar, the main accused in Hathras stampede, was arrested from Delhi.

, he analyzes the political scenario after Lok Sabha elections.Excerpts:Before the results were announced, I had said that ticket distribution was a major issue for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Many candidates were repeated which did not go down well with party workers at several places. These candidates lacked strong connection with the local populace, and there was a lack of consultation with local leadership in ticket distribution. This led to a lack of enthusiasm among workers. However, the strong law and order situation under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came as a significant advantage, contributing to victories in 33 seats.Before the elections, a BJP MP from Karnataka said that 400 seats would be needed to bring about changes in the Constitution. This statement did not resonate well with the ST/SC and OBC communities as they thought that reservation would end. Across the country, it is evident that these communities do not prioritize religion and instead they revere BR Ambedkar. This sentiment was reflected in the election results in Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, as predicted previously, Ram Mandir did not emerge as a significant issue in 2024.Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from Rae Bareli injected fresh enthusiasm among Congress workers in Uttar Pradesh. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s active campaigning for KL Sharma in Amethi hinted at a potential shift in party dynamics, which manifested in the election results. Now, with renewed enthusiasm among workers, both Rahul and Priyanka are poised for a new phase. BJP should strategize to counter them. Rahul’s recent speech as the leader of the opposition in Parliament has brought a new vigour to Indian politics. His delivery, confidence, and composure have rattled the BJP, marking a significant moment in a decade. As anticipated in May 2023, Congress’s victory in the Karnataka assembly elections signals a new era for the party.While the BJP made significant efforts to regain ground in West Bengal, voters have strong memories of the Communist Party era. TMC’s victory was a response to countering the terror of that period. Mamata Banerjee, through her hard work and tenacity over the past two decades, has surpassed challenges. Her adversaries were unable to dent her strong image. This will continue in future.In Maharashtra, as predicted earlier, there was a sympathy wave in favour of Uddhav Thackeray’s faction due to their sudden removal from power. BJP’s policies and candidate selections during their tenure in the state bolstered Uddhav Thackeray’s position. Wrong policies of BJP made Uddhav stronger. It will be challenging for BJP to match the opposition in the upcoming assembly elections. In Odisha, BJP’s efforts are commendable, which aim to eradicate corruption and bring positive change. Regarding Manipur, politics should not be only for governance; it must reflect compassion in its decisions.He has emerged as a prominent figure in Indian politics and is here to stay. He will come out of his problems. Both he and his wife. Arvind and his wife Sunita Kejriwal have established themselves as influential figures. He will continue to play a significant role in the political landscape.",Vimal Singh believes that discontent within the BJP over ticket distribution led to considerable loss to the party in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s law and order policy contributed to theParty’S victory on 33 seats. He believes that the Ram temple issue failed to fetch votes for the BJP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111547493,imgsize-92802,width-400,resizemode-4/111547493.jpg"
