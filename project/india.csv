Did US play any role in India-China LAC agreement? State department responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-us-play-any-role-in-india-china-lac-agreement-state-department-responds/articleshow/114755692.cms,"Matthew Miller, the spokesperson for the US state department. (ANI)

The United States has expressed approval over the easing of tensions along the India-China border, following the recent disengagement of troops from both countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Matthew Miller , the spokesperson for the US state department , said that the situation is being closely monitored and confirmed discussions with India on the issue. “We are closely following the developments and we understand that both countries have taken initial steps to withdraw troops from the friction points along the LAC. We welcome any reduction in tensions along the border,” Miller said during a press briefing.""We have talked to our Indian partners and taken a brief on it, but we did not play any role in this resolution,"" he added.The disengagement process in the Depsang and Demchok areas of eastern Ladakh is under way. The conflict along the LAC dates back to April 2020 when hostilities began, leading to strained relations between the two nations. Both sides have been working to return to the pre-2020 status quo.Recently, the Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that troops from both countries were progressing with the agreed-upon disengagement work. Chinese spokesperson Lin Jian noted that the process is moving ""smoothly.""On October 21, India announced a new agreement with China regarding patrolling along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, marking the end of the prolonged military standoff since 2020. This announcement followed a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Brics Summit in Russia, where they welcomed the new patrolling arrangements.",The United States has expressed approval over the easing of tensions along the India-China border.

Make for India: FMCG companies think & design desi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-for-india-fmcg-companies-think-design-desi/articleshow/114753835.cms,"MUMBAI: Inside Hindustan Unilever 's headquarters in Mumbai, a section of the research and development team is busy studying consumer trends and drawing up ideas on the next set of products that the company should push into retail shelves to cater to changing consumer tastes. As Indians become discerning and selective in terms of the products they consume, FMCG firms are increasingly focusing on local nuances and ""designing for India"".At HUL, which is relying heavily on technology to bring products to the market faster, the way the firm processes products for different regions has also undergone a change. ""In South, the Red Label tea we sell is a finer blend. In North, the tea is more daaneydar (grainier). The way we process the tea is also quite different,"" Vibhav Sanzgiri, executive director (R&D) at HUL, said. India's varying weather patterns, diverse tastes and cultures have necessitated companies to design for the Indian palate. ""We are looking at health, taste, wellness, fragrance and even packaging,"" said Sanzgiri, who leads a team of over 800 scientists across HUL's three R&D centres in India.Besides, consumers today are willing to pay a premium for differentiated products, enabling firms to pack more in a product. Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, has introduced arginine-based toothpaste in the Indian market considering consumers' affinity for snacking and sugary food. ""While designing and developing products for Indian consumers, we need to build on the various nuances of Indian taste preferences and ensure what is the target consumer group. Given our population size, we have to innovate for all age groups and specialised needs as all of them are quite substantial,"" Swati Agarwal, executive vice-president (IGTC) at Colgate-Palmolive India, said. It is also packing its shower gels with localised fragrances.For Marico , building for India is all about offering healthier options without compromising on the taste. To that end, the company has been pushing honey, millets, soya chunks and oodles into the market under the Saffola brand. The offerings come after its oats, infused with Indianised flavours, gained acceptance among consumers. ""Indian consumer preferences are continually evolving. There is a growing demand for healthier and sustainable FMCG products,"" said Dr Shilpa Vora, chief R&D officer. A recent study by venture capital firm Fireside Ventures showed that urban Indian consumers are willing to pay upto a 15% premium across food categories (covers five segments including staples, functional beverages and healthy snacks) and up to 30% for healthier snacking, functional drinks and ready-to-eat/ready-to-cook items.Nestle India has tapped into this premiumisation trend to launch over 140 new products in the market over the past eight years. Some of these like the Maggi oats-millets and KitKat Dessert Delight Strawberry were later taken to other global markets. ""Everybody is aspiring for the best product suited for them and this trend will continue. Indians today travel much more, they have more global exposure, the influence on consumers is unconstrained and we might even leapfrog certain global trends,"" Sanzgiri said.Recently, PepsiCo India added a localised red chilli flavour variant in its Lay's portfolio to appeal to desi nuances. ""As a nation of many Indias, Lay's recognises the importance of tailoring its products to cater to diverse preferences,"" Soumya Rathor, category lead (potato chips) at PepsiCo India, said.","FMCG firms are increasingly focusing on local nuances and ""designing for India"" India's varying weather patterns, diverse tastes and cultures have necessitated companies to design for the Indian palate.

"Compared to BJP, Congress falls short in seat-sharing bargain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/compared-to-bjp-congress-falls-short-in-seat-sharing-bargain/articleshow/114751671.cms,"NAGPUR: As the final nominations are in, it has become clear that Congress has failed to secure enough seats on the MVA bargaining table. Congress managed to eke out around 100 seats in the MVA alliance. In comparison, BJP walked away with around 150 in the seat-sharing haggling match within the Mahayuti.While it's clear that Congress is way off the mark, opinion is divided as to who is responsible for it. Last week, reports surfaced that Congress' Rahul Gandhi had chided state-level functionaries for a poor seat-sharing deal, though these reports were denied by the party.A Vidarbha-based Congress neta said the bargaining game was lost by his party because of two reasons. ""First, the internal differences within our state leaders. Second reason was that unlike the Mahayuti, our two regional allies are extremely hard bargainers with a hotline to our high command,"" he added.""Both NCP (SP) & Sena (UBT) have direct access to Congress high command. Sharad Pawar, for obvious reasons, was able to speak anytime with our decision-makers whenever bargaining became too hot,"" the neta said.""At the same time, Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut can apparently dial in Rahul Gandhi at any point, thus making local functionaries redundant in case of a deadlock,"" said the neta. He added that in Mahayuti, neither Ajit Pawar nor Eknath Shinde can directly call PM Modi or Amit Shah, and that went in favour of BJP's state unit during bargaining sessions.Another Nagpur-based leader, who is also an ex-minister, said Congress netas from western Maharashtra scuttled some hard bargaining by state president Nana Patole and LoP Vijay Wadettiwar. ""Patole has an alpha-male type personality, and that is reflected in the bargaining talks for seats. He was driving a hard bargain for seats. While he may not always be right, ultimately it was important for the party to stick together,"" he added.",Congress managed to eke out around 100 seats in the MVA alliance.

This creates a peculiar situation within the Mahayuti alliance because the Shiv Sena has also fielded a candidate from the same seat.A month ago when Malik declared he would contest as an NCP nominee from Shivajinagar, the BJP leadership comprising deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis , state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and his Mumbai counterpart Ashish Shelar had expressed disapproval, arguing that he was accused of links with the underworld and Dawood Ibrahim.Significantly, after poll dates were declared and NCP shortlisted its nominees, Malik was given the authorisation form by the party, but the decision was not made public. On Tuesday, he first submitted his nomination as an independent candidate before the returning officer in Mankhurd. After a few hours, he submitted another form as an NCP nominee.Malik said the NCP's decision reflects the leadership's confidence in him.""I am not bothered by opposition to my candidature. I am thankful to Pawar, Praful Patel, and Sunil Tatkare for expressing confidence in me,"" Malik told TOI. Malik said he was confident of his victory as well as of his daughter Sana from neighbouring Anushaktinagar constituency. ""I am sure my daughter and I will win in the elections despite the presence of several rebels in both constituencies,"" Malik said.Shelar reacted saying ""BJP will not campaign for Malik. Accordingly, instructions have been given to our grassroots level workers.""On Malik's daughter Sana Malik, Shelar said until any evidence or information comes to light, the alliance candidate is the BJP candidate as well.Mankhurd is a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, and has been represented by Abu Azmi for three consecutive terms. In the last election, he won against a Sena candidate, which is the reason the Sena was officially allocated the seat this time.Malik who is also a three-term MLA, was a minister in the MVA govt. He was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on Feb 23, 2022. Malik was granted bail on medical grounds in July this year. The Shiv Sena's Suresh Patil, known as 'Bullet Patil', is the official Sena candidate here.",Former minister Nawab Malik faces a money laundering probe.

Reacting to Pawar's statement at a Baramati rally that the Tata Airbus project was shifted to Gujarat from Maharashtra, Fadnavis, wrote in a post, ""Before a false narrative is set, the truth must be told to Maharashtra once again.""He even shared links to various newspaper articles to back his claim that the Tatas never proposed to bring the project to Maharashtra. He said usually the project's location is decided at the time of the MoU, which is a norm. During the MoU, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh were considered. ""During this entire period, the state govt was the Maha Vikas Aghadi. When Tata officials visited the MADC office in Nagpur, no one was ready to respond. During the MVA tenure, four locations in Gujarat were finalised for this project as reported in detail,"" he posted.Regarding the Foxconn-Vedanta project, he said letters were written to the state during the MVA tenure in May 2022. Inspection at Talegaon was done in June 2022 without approval from the high-level committee and cabinet sub-committee, which never met until June 29, 2022. ""After our govt came to power under Eknathrao Shinde, the first letter from Vedanta Group came on July 14.

NEET PG 2024 Counselling Delay

:

Exam held, results declared, and yet counselling nowhere in sight

As students call for help, medical associations back them

Is this a joke: Students air frustrations over social media

“Guys, match fixing chal rahi hai NBE ki taraf se. Tabhi itna time lag raha hai counselling main. Kya lagta hai?”

“Ye kya mazak ho Raha hai humare saath?”

Medical Experts Speak Out on India’s ‘Counselling Conundrum’

From March to November, NEET PG’s long road to nowhere: When will the wait end?

Forty days after the NEET PG 2024 counselling registration started, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) is yet to publish the official counselling schedule on its website, mcc.nic.in. With the Supreme Court extending the NEET PG hearing to November 19, medical aspirants are frustrated and question the authority's commitment to respecting its healthcare professionals.The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate courses, held on August 11 following multiple delays, saw results declared on August 23 for the over 216,000 candidates who sat for the exam. Concerns over discrepancies, such as an unusually high increase in top scores and unexpectedly low marks for candidates in the second shift, prompted 19 aspirants to file a petition against the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), demanding transparency through the publication of the answer key and raw scores.Dr Datta, President of the Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), highlighted the ongoing frustration among students and medical associations. Sharing an update on X (formerly Twitter) on October 26, Dr Datta reported that FAIMA has received multiple appeals from aspirants and resident doctors requesting intervention.He stated, “We have spoken to our executives, a few aspirants and contacts in the NBE to figure out an amicable solution to this impasse.” Dr. Datta expressed concern that the situation could worsen without a resolution and urged those directly involved in the issue to unite in addressing the delays and errors in the process.As the prolonged delay continues, some students have resorted to social media to voice their frustrations through memes and satirical posts. One post reads,—translated as “Guys, match-fixing seems to be going on by the NBE. That’s why the counselling is taking so long. What do you think?” Another asks,—or, “What is this joke they’re playing on us?”Another user outlined the prolonged process: “From March to November: The NEET PG 2024 exam on August 11th, and now, 4 rounds of 'counseling case hearings'—1st hearing: Sept 27, 2nd: Oct 4, 3rd: Oct 25, 4th: Nov 19. Nearly a year wasted. Does India really value its doctors?”Among the critical voices is Dr. Meet Ghonia, National Secretary of FORDA India, who highlighted the timeline from the original NEET PG date in June, through the August results, to the current waiting period in October, stating, “Thousands of doctors are left waiting for counselling without any employment.” Dr. Ghonia emphasized the need for healthcare administrators with medical expertise to address systemic issues in PG medical admissions.Orthopedic surgeon and FAIMA patron, Dr. Rohan Krishnan, echoed these sentiments, urging the MCC and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to initiate the counselling process without further delay. “Any delay is going to ruin the hard work and mental peace of students who had worked hard,” Dr. Krishnan shared, adding that a six-month gap between exam and admission dates should not become the norm due to administrative issues.","The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate courses, held on August 11 following multiple delays, saw results declared on August 23 for the over 216,000 candidates who sat for the exam.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday strongly refuted allegations of poll irregularities in Haryana, calling them ""baseless"". In a formal communication to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , the ECI outlined its findings, asserting that each stage of the electoral process was meticulously conducted under the observation of Congress candidates or their agents in democratic processes.""The Commission categorically rejects all baseless allegations and apprehensions conveyed by INC regarding all aspects of the electoral process in the recently concluded election to the state assembly of Haryana,"" said the commission in its statement.It further added that ""the Commission normally refrains from responding to grievances relating to constituency specific decentralised electoral processes, whether in case of electoral roll or candidates or deployment of man and material or conduct of poll or counting, officials like ERO/ RO/DEO being the fully empowered election authorities. However, ECI is duty bound to protect and defend the integrity of the core design of this statutory decentralized scheme, that is being sought to be eroded or duplicated, by 'generic' petitions/grievances setting out false narratives without any evidence whatsoever, raised in proximity to polling or counting day, which have serious potential to fuel the surcharged environment.""The EC also said that raising such complaints can cause issues in the country. ""It is needless to remind that such frivolous and unfounded doubts have the potential of creating turbulence when crucial steps like polling and counting are in live play, a time when both public and political parties’ anxiousness is peaking,"" it said.Calling the approach of the party ""carrying baseless allegations"" publicly ""disconcerting"" the EC said that it is ""compelled to note that with no evidence whatsoever of any statutory electoral step being compromised and candidate’s consent to proceed to each next stage being on record; the INC has once again raised the smoke of a “generic” doubt about the credibility of an entire electoral outcome exactly in similar manner as it has done in recent past.Directing its remarks towards the Congress, it said, ""This is least expected of a national political party. The Commission appreciates the criticality of the considered views of political parties in sustaining and strengthening electoral democracy in the country and assures that it will remain committed towards timely grievance redressal. At the same time, the Commission sincerely urges INC to take firm and concrete steps, matching with the party’s long and illustrious standing, to amend their afore stated approach and in doing so set an example for emulation by one and all to responsibly conduct themselves at sensitive electoral stages so as to avoid possibilities of precipitation of public unrest and chaos.""The commission further added that various Constitutional Courts delivered 42 judgments affirming the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) after thoroughly examining available records and evidence. The Courts broadly observed that ""EVMs are not hackable"", and there is ""no material on record to evidence that the EVMs in India are unreliable or suffer from any drawback"". With the VVPAT system, EVMs ""ensure the accuracy of the voting system"".The Congress had stated that EVMs associated with the BJP displayed battery levels of 99%, while those indicating victories for Congress showed only 60-70% charge.In response, the EC said that it has released comprehensive information on its website addressing common questions about EVM battery operations. The FAQ section elaborates on multiple technical aspects of the power systems used in EVMs.The document explains different battery varieties and clarifies the application of alkaline cells. It distinguishes between the power packs used in EVMs and those found in mobile phones. Additionally, it details how EVMs maintain consistent performance across varying voltage levels.The information also addresses a specific query about why the power pack indicator often displays 99 percent charge even after continuous usage throughout polling day.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday strongly refuted allegations of poll irregularities in Haryana.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a major shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.



BRICS Leader's Summit In Kazan

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.India has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year. The shipments, worth $300 million, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672849,imgsize-99996,width-400,resizemode-4/114672849.jpg"

"Shariat Council not a court, husband must get legal stamp on talaq: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shariat-council-not-a-court-husband-must-get-legal-stamp-on-talaq-hc/articleshow/114705173.cms,"MADURAI: Shariat Council is a private organisation and not a court, Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled recently while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.One of the focal points of the case is Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath, the Shariat Council, issuing a divorce certificate to the husband in 2017. Though it can help resolve family and financial issues, it can’t issue divorce certificates or enforce penalties.Justice G R Swaminathan criticised the divorce certificate, describing it as “shocking”.He said the council had accepted the husband’s petition for triple talaq and attempted to mediate, but blamed the wife for not cooperating.“Only courts duly constituted by the state can deliver judgments. Shariat Council is a private body and not a court,” the judge reiterated, dismissing the husband’s revision petition. “So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist.”In 2018, the wife disputed the divorce and filed a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic ViolenceAct before a Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court. She also asserted that the third talaq was not served on her, meaning the marriage was still valid. The husband married a second time that year.In 2021, the magistrate ruled in favour of the first wife, directing the husband to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation for domestic violence and Rs 25,000 a month for the maintenance of their minor child. Later, a sessions court dismissed the husband’s appeal against this decision, prompting him to file the current revision petition before the HC.During the hearing, Justice Swaminathan said the husband claimed to have properly pronounced talaq three times. “If it is disputed by the wife, the question arises if the marriage has been validly dissolved. So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist,” the judge observed.The HC said the husband must go to the court and obtain a declaration. “The issue cannot be left to the unilateral determination of the husband since that would amount to the husband becoming a judge of his own cause,” the judge observed.The judge said the act of bigamy caused “considerable emotional distress and pain” to the wife, amounting to cruelty.“If a Hindu, Christian, Parsi, or Jewish husband contracts a second marriage during the subsistence of the first marriage, it would constitute cruelty besides being an offence of bigamy. It would obviously be considered an act of domestic violence entitling the wife to claim compensation under Section 12 of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Will this proposition apply in the case of Muslims? The answer is yes,” Justice Swaminathan said.","Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.","U.S. sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

""They are working to spread anger and hatred.

His absence throughout the morning and his last-minute scramble sparked speculations in political circles about his intent to contest.Former in-charge secretary of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh Congress committees, Ahmed arrived at Nagpur Central returning officer's booth moments after the 3pm deadline, after claiming to cross a mountain of obstacles like road closures, vehicular restrictions, security protocols, and last-minute documentation.The submission window was open from 11am to 3pm.Public announcements urged candidates to expedite submissions at 2.30pm, with a final reminder at 2.45pm. The doors were sealed at 3pm. Ahmed remained at the returning officer's camp till 8pm, pleading that his nomination be accepted.

"Close to 150 rebels in Maharashtra poll fray, pose challenge to MVA & Mahayuti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-to-150-rebels-in-maharashtra-poll-fray-pose-challenge-to-mva-mahayuti/articleshow/114750421.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Rebels threatened to become a headache for the two major alliances in the state as nominations for the assembly polls drew to a close Tuesday. While Mahayuti identified 80 rebels, close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's, or multi-party alliance's, official candidates. With Nov 4 being the last date for withdrawing nominations, the fronts have nearly a week to sort out differences and persuade rebels to pull out of the fray.Both the MVA and the Mahayuti said they had declared candidates for all 288 seats.After nominations closed, MVA had accounted for 286 of its nominees filing papers (103 from Congress - final figure for that party - 96 from Sena-UBT and 87 from Sharad Pawar-led NCP), with the three parties giving seats from their own quotas to smaller allies. In Mahayuti, the count came to 284 (BJ, Shiv Sena 80 and NCP 52), including smaller allies. Both alliances said the remaining seats would be accounted for once information came in from various parts of the state. However, from Mahayuti list, it appears it has declared two candidates in 5 constituencies, and none in two seats; it has declared 289 candidates in all.Among the prominent rebels are BJP's Gopal Shetty from Borivli who has filed papers against his party's official candidate Sanjay Upadhyay and NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal's nephew Sameer, who has filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Nandgaon assembly constituency in Nashik district against Shiv Sena MLA Suhas Kande.Prominent netas of Mahayuti and MVA admitted that the presence of rebels in the fray is a cause for concern and that they would have to tackle the matter. There is time still to do that: papers of candidates will be scrutinised on Wednesday and Nov 4 is the last date for withdrawal of candidatures. After that, a clear picture will emerge on the number of rebels still left in the fray.While the confusion that prevailed for a fortnight over who would contest how many seats more or less ended on Tuesday, significantly the Mahayuti, despite several rounds of talks, kept its seat-sharing formula secret throughout, while MVA's formula kept changing publicly. Initially, it was proposed that Congress would contest 103 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 90, and NCP (SP) 85. Later, UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut proposed a formula of 85 seats each, and since there was no consensus on that, Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat proposed a new formula, where all constituents of MVA would contest 90 seats each. The dispute was then taken to the court of the AICC, followed by separate meetings with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, after which the issue was resolved. ""There was no fixed formula; seats were decided based on merit and the winnability factor,"" a senior Congress politician said.State NCP president Sunil Tatkare said the seat-sharing formula of the Mahayuti was decided after considering all factors. ""We took note of the winnability factor. I am sure that the Mahayuti will retain power in the state,"" he said. Tatkare has convened a meeting of all senior leaders of his party on Wednesday to take stock of the political situation. ""We will meet our senior leaders to resolve intra-party disputes,"" Tatkare said.Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar was also confident of Mahayuti's win, saying selection of candidates was purely on merit and their ability to deliver and to tackle problems faced by the people. ""We will lead once again,"" Shelar said. Shelar felt the political picture in the state would be clear after the last date of withdrawal of nominations. ""We will know the exact number of candidates in the fray after the last date of withdrawal,"" he said.AICC secretary Ramesh Chennithala said that the people of Maharashtra would reject the ""corrupt"" Mahayuti govt led by Eknath Shinde.","Close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's official candidates.
