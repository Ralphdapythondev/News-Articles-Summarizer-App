Museum’s new initiative turns ancient artefacts into teaching tools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/museums-new-initiative-turns-ancient-artefacts-into-teaching-tools/articleshow/112961058.cms,"When Anna Anguissola, an associate professor of classical archaeology at the University of Pisa, walked around the Key Gallery at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya ( CSMVS ) earlier this year, she thought she’d be talking about what she already knew inside out. Instead, she found herself rethinking her own work. How the same concepts she had studied for years—like the human form and deities as well as contexts and materials—suddenly took on new meaning when seen through the lens of other cultures.Back in Pisa, Anguissola has been shaking things up in her department inspired by what she learnt in Mumbai. “Starting this semester, I've introduced short modules of direct observation of artworks following the strategies we experimented with in Mumbai,” she said. These changes include group discussions, hands-on class activities and creative exercises like writing ‘museum captions’ that she believes is yielding “unexpected results.”This shift in perspective is precisely what CSMVS aimed for with their new international academic programme of turning museum galleries into interactive classrooms where objects become more than just artefacts behind glass.In February, CSMVS teamed up with the University of Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum and Global Humanities Network for a first-of-its-kind partnership between museums and universities to establish new ways of teaching with museum objects.The initiative was part of the larger 10-month exhibition titled ‘Ancient Sculptures: India Egypt Assyria Greece Rome’, a first-of-its-kind global co-curation project in the country, that showcased our interconnected histories through art and sculpture from The British Museum in London, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, and The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles alongside Indian institutions like Delhi’s National Museum, Bihar Museum in Patna, and District Museum in Madhya Pradesh. Running since December, the exhibition will continue till October 1.Split into two phases—one for university faculty and another for students—the programme brought together experts in history, epigraphy, numismatics, linguistics, art, literature as well as curators from India, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, representing the very cultures featured in the Ancient Sculptures exhibition. Flipping the script on the chalk-and-talk tradition, CSMVS mapped out lessons that allowed participants to get up close with the sculptures rather than simply reading from textbooks.The five-day program for university faculty involving 23 Indian universities, was built around daily themes, each shedding light on a different facet of ancient cultures. The goal — according to Neal Spencer, deputy Director of collections and research at the Fitzwilliam Museum and academic lead on the faculty program — was to use museum objects as teaching tools to unlock stories about ancient societies, their artists, and the people they depicted.“Looking closely at an object shows you that you can come back again and again to looking at it in a different way if you start with the object rather than start with your idea or your text,” he explained.Themes ranged from ‘Fashioning Forms’ which examined how ancient cultures gave physical form to gods, humans, and other entities, to ‘Visual & Narrative’ on how these static objects conveyed stories, beliefs and myths. Other themes challenged participants to examine the complex relationship between art, environment and society.“Learning to engage with sources and objects not just as distant artefacts but sensory experiences,” as an important part of pedagogy is something that Manjiri Kamat, a professor of history at the University of Mumbai, began to rethink and now plans to integrate into her teaching.After the faculty program, focus shifted to post-graduate students in June, with 16 students from six universities across India taking part in a similar structure, focusing on daily themes and gallery sessions, where they examined the similarities, differences, and subtle details that made each piece unique.“The academic program will continue to be international for a global perspective on how India interacted with the rest of the world and how cultures and ideas travelled. By involving source country experts, the learnings and conversations are more contemporary,” explained Vaidehi Savnal, curatorial lead for education and public programmes at CSMVS.“We’re working with colleges and universities in Mumbai to integrate this new approach into their curriculum,” says Savnal, adding how this new approach taps into India’s New Education Policy, that advocates practical learning and field visits. So far, 20 students from the University of Mumbai have already completed a month-long ‘on-the-job’ training at the museum with hands-on experience of visitor mapping and digital content creation.Looking ahead, Savnal says that the next phase of the Ancient World Project will involve at least three similar programmes each year. “We plan to expand beyond Mumbai to collaborate with more museums and universities,” she adds.",CSMVS teamed up with the University of Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum and Global Humanities Network for a first-of-its-kind partnership between museums and universities to establish new ways of teaching with museum objects.

"Why Balochistan's on the boil, what it means for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-balochistans-on-the-boil-what-it-means-for-india/articleshow/112960475.cms,"New dimensions?

The China angle

What Pakistan can do?

Implication for India

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.Bugti's killing only exposed the limitation of kinetic action, in the absence of any genuine attempt to address the aspirations of the tribal population, as it led to the emergence of more armed separatist groups that now target not just Pakistan security forces and Chinese interests but also Punjabi and Sindhi migrant workers.There's no doubt that the attacks were on a newer scale and showed increased audacity of the insurgents, their strong support base and increasing ability to operate freely.According to former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, targeting of Punjabi workers introduces a new ethnic dimension, signalling that the Baloch radicals are looking to provoke and challenge the primarily Punjabi army.Nearly half of those killed by the BLA in the latest escalation were Punjabi workers. The Baloch people resent the influx of Punjabis who are seen as having benefited from economic opportunities arising in Balochistan at the expense of the Baloch people. This has fed into the insurgency against the Pakistan state and the anti-Punjabi sentiment that sustains it. The sentiment has its genesis in the traditional domination of the Punjabi elite in the civil bureaucracy and the composition of the Punjabi-dominated army, which lords over the province in the absence of any genuine political leadership or effort to address the local grievances.To an average Baloch, who believes he has the first claim over the province's natural resources and sees himself as a victim of the federal government's discriminatory policies, Punjabi workers only symbolise State repression, as practiced by the essentially Punjabi establishment. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the reluctance of the establishment to engage civil rights groups have added to the mistrust.According to Bisaria, the latest episode also represents a security meltdown and possibly a coalescing of the Afghan/ Pashtun and Baloch insurgencies. TTP (Pakistan Taliban) and BLA are coordinating, if not colluding. Unsurprisingly, India is being accused of being involved in the latest and previous attacks,'' he says.Islamabad has repeatedly blamed India for providing financial support to the secessionists and Iran of allowing them safe hideouts. India has officially maintained these allegations don't merit any serious consideration and that Pakistan must introspect its own support to terrorism.Pakistan remains under attack from the TTP in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the army has been worried for the past few years about a developing nexus between Baloch separatists and the TTP in Balochistan, which is home to a sizeable Pashtun population as well. TTP has cheered attacks by Baloch militants, accused Pakistan army of carrying out massacres in Balochistan and said groups like BLA and TTP have a common enemy. BLA has been designated as a terrorist group by both the US and UK.Not surprisingly, China was quick to condemn the attacks, saying it's prepared to enhance counterterrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan to jointly uphold regional peace and security. Pakistan's hopes of turning the resource-rich Balochistan, its largest and most backward province, into an economic and energy hub have hinged on the BRI's flagship $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC projects, however, have been marred by violent insurgency.CPEC facilities, along with Chinese engineers and workers, have been targeted by the BLA and other insurgent groups that accuse China of arming Pakistan against Baloch separatists and of working with Islamabad to exploit the natural resources of the province, while aiding the marginalisation of the local people. Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif accused the separatists of working to scuttle the CPEC in his remarks on the latest attacks. With the BLA displaying greater operational capacity in the form of multiple attacks across the province, the CPEC, including the centrepiece Gwadar port, will remain vulnerable to the threat of violence.Balochistan, which accounts for more than 40% of Pakistan's land mass but only 6% of the population, has a long history of political unrest, as insurgency seeking a separate Baloch state dates to the time of independence. Economic oppression, anti-Punjabi sentiment, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and the plain inacceptance of the idea of Baloch nationalism have all contributed to the insurgency that is now jostling with traditionally more high-profile issues like Pakistan's role in Afghanistan for international limelight.In the interest of regional, particularly its own, stability, Pakistan must find a way to politically address the Baloch discontent, instead of subjugating the local population with its militarist approach. To begin with, it must look into their grievances, particularly exploitation of resources which remains a sensitive issue. Insurgency has been boosted by the perception among the local people that they are being denied benefits of the exploration of Balochistan's considerable mineral resources.While the army for now remains formidable enough to prevent any potential Balkanisation of Pakistan, it must encourage the federal government to enter a meaningful dialogue with the Baloch nationalists to mitigate violence and look at ways to finding a long-term solution, despite the seemingly intractable nature of the conflict. The Baloch people, with their distinct identity, have traditionally been seen as secular and it's in Pakistan's interest to ensure they don't work with groups like the TTP which are driven by extremist religious ideology.Pakistan also has to find a way to engage civil rights groups like the Baloch Yakjehti Committee that want to peacefully raise issues like enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.Pakistan will continue to accuse India of funding the BLA. In the past, it has justified crackdown on the separatists by talking up their alleged links with the enemy''. India will of course closely follow how the Pakistan army reacts to the Baloch escalation, as it guards against any attempt to disrupt the assembly polls in J&K. There has been a series of recent terror attacks in Jammu, leading PM Narendra Modi to warn Pakistan against using terrorism or proxy war against India. India believes Pakistan must introspect why attacks have increased in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since the return of Afghan Taliban to Kabul, a development that Pakistan thought portended the return of its strategic depth in Afghanistan.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

"North India likely to see heavy rainfall in September, cautions IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-likely-to-see-heavy-rainfall-in-sept-cautions-imd/articleshow/112957620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Continuing its Aug trend, monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country in Sept is likely to be ' above normal ', with some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides, India Meteorological Department said Saturday. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.Good rains (287mm) in Aug, however, could not bring down the overall temperature during the month as it reported the highest average minimum temperature and fourth-highest average mean temperature since 1901.This can be attributed to variation in spatial distribution of rainfall - northwest India got 32% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug (second highest in the month since 2001), whereas south peninsula received merely around 1% more than normal rains in the month.Though the country as a whole is likely to get 'above-normal' rainfall in Sept, in certain areas - north Bihar, northeast UP, most parts of northeast India, extreme northwest India and many parts of south peninsular India - it is likely to be 'below normal'. Overall, the four-month (June-Sept) monsoon season, as predicted in mid-April, will be logged as 'above-normal' rainfall activity.Good rains in Aug, mainly in 'monsoon core' zone (rainfed areas), already had its positive impact on kharif sowing. Total acreage of the season is well on course to cross 'normal' (average of past five years) sown area, indicating possibility of a higher foodgrain output in the crop year. Good rains in monsoon season also mean adequate soil moisture and enough water in reservoirs to feed rabi (winter-sown) crops.La Nina phenomenon has, however, not yet formed. It is now expected to be formed by Sept-end, but it won't have any effect on the current rainy season as the summer monsoon may, by that time, be in its withdrawal phase.La Nina during Sept-Nov generally weakens the northeast (winter) monsoon in southeast India.""It is, however, too early to predict its impact. We would be able to say anything on this by Sept-end. We'll also see how the La Nina will lead to cyclonic conditions,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.On the reasons for heavy rainfall in Aug, he said six low-pressure systems formed during the month (out of that one became a deep depression and another a cyclone) could be one of the major influencing factors. Aug generally sees an increase in trend for the 'break' (pause) days of monsoon, but such a phase was missing this time and the month could see one of the highest number of active days in the recent past. Earlier such high numbers of active days were observed in 2020 and 2022.Mohapatra said, ""Above-normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except for some areas in northwest India, south peninsular India, and some pockets of east-central India, where normal to below-normal maximum temperatures are likely.""","Some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides.

"Government's resolve to reform has only got stronger, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govts-resolve-to-reform-has-only-got-stronger-says-pm/articleshow/112957528.cms,"'Want made-in-India product on every dining table'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday vowed to press ahead with reforms , with a focus on high growth and stable policies , to realise the dreams of a developed country and asserted that the “resolve has got only stronger” in his third term.“I can only assure that the resolve is stronger and like our citizens, govt is full of hope and confidence,” he said, in yet another put-down to suggestions that lower numbers in the Lok Sabha would sap his ambition and energy for reforms.At the inaugural ET World Leaders Forum, Modi described the third decade of the 21st century as a “lift-up decade for India” and sought support from business leaders to take forward the country’s development story.“By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country. We want more and more Indian companies to emerge as global brands ,” he said.Delivering a speech with his trademark high energy, Modi said, “By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country. We know that you too will participate in this journey. We want more and more Indian companies to emerge as global brands. We want India to be a leader in every sector. Our promise is to facilitate, you promise to innovate. Our promise is to reform, you promise to perform. Our promise is to give stable policies, you promise positive disruption. Our promise is to focus on high growth, you promise high quality. Think big, we have to write many success stories together.”The PM took on the opposition over its taunts of a diminished NDA majority in Parliament, saying voters, especially women and youth, have voted for continuity in a year when several countries around the world that went to elections have voted for change.Describing India as the biggest land of opportunity, he told the audience comprising Indian and global CEOs that the country respects wealth creators, a statement meant to comfort businesses.PM identified four pillars for building the foundations of a developed country or Viksit Bharat. He highlighted the push towards skilling and education, focus on making India a global food basket, thrust on green energy, and the drive to turn India into a major tourist destination along with development of technology. “To have at least one Made-in-India food product on every dining table around the world this is our resolve.”India has been a major driver of global growth, he said, pointing out that its economy has expanded 90% during the last decade, compared with a 35% increase in the size of the global economy. “Today, India’s progress is making global headlines… India has often outperformed both predictions and its peers.”","“By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country.

AI-powered device helps treat man with clot in blood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-powered-device-helps-treat-man-with-clot-in-blood/articleshow/112957367.cms,"NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man suffering from acute pulmonary thromboembolism ( PE ) due to a blood clot in his leg was successfully treated with a new AI-powered device .Pulmonary thromboembolism, a form of pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs when a blood clot moves through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, potentially leading to irreversible harm. Doctors said that PE is among the most severe complications associated with blood clots.When a clot reaches the lungs, it can obstruct blood circulation and may result in significant damage or even death.Dr VS Bedi , chairman of vascular surgery at Sir Gangaram Hospital , treated the patient using a device designed to remove blood clots with remarkable accuracy.""The AI in the machine helps it target only the clots, avoiding sucking of normal blood and reducing the risks of severe blood loss causing hypotension and other complications associated with older methods,"" he explained.Conventional treatments for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) have been associated with significant risks, often requiring procedures that carry dangers like bleeding and the need for repeated interventions.The patient arrived at the hospital complaining of chest pain, breathing difficulty, and swelling in the left leg, which had persisted for three days. After seeking treatment at other hospitals without relief, the patient turned to Sir Gangaram Hospital.Upon arrival, the patient was quickly taken for thrombosuction using the AI-powered device, which functions like a vacuum machine, sucking out all blood clots with minimal blood loss.This approach eliminates the need for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion and thrombolytic agent infusion, both of which can have dangerous side effects, such as internal bleeding in the brain, intestines, and other bleeding disorders.","A 28-year-old man suffering from acute pulmonary thromboembolism ( PE ) due to a blood clot in his leg was successfully treated with a new AI-powered device.

"India clears Singapore Airlines’ FDI, paves way for Vistara merger into Air India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-clears-singapore-airlines-fdi-paves-way-for-vistara-merger-into-air-india/articleshow/112910958.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India , paving the way for the merger of Vistara into AI by the end of this calendar year.In a statement, SIA — which owned 49% in Vistara and will own get 25.1% stake in the merged AI by investing Rs 2,059 crore in it, said on Friday: “SIA confirms the Indian Govt has approved its proposed FDI into the enlarged Air India Group, as part of the ongoing merger of Air India and Vistara.This approval, along with other governmental and regulatory approvals received to-date, marks a significant development towards the completion of the merger.”“SIA and its partner Tata Sons aim to finalise the merger by the end of 2024. Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Only FDI approval was remaining for the merger as all other nods from agencies like the Competition Commission and DGCA are already in place. Tatas will have remaining 74.9% stake in AI.After Govt FDI nod, AI-Vistara will shortly communicate timelines of the merger to passengers. People who have booked tickets on Vistara flights post the date of merger will be informed that their flight will be on Air India along with the changed flight number of AI and its time.Sources say the date of merger is likely to be after Diwali (Nov 1) as the airline will avoid taking any chances during the peak festive travel season. “There will be a decent window between post Diwali and the onset of fog that usually happens after Dec 20 which leads to flight disruptions. Ideally the merger should happen in that space to sort out any merger teething issues like informing passengers booked on Vistara their changed AI flight details before fog adds further complexity to the equation,” said sources.Vistara has 70 aircraft which will continue to fly in the airline’s livery. The same will changed to AI’s new livery when the aircraft go in for heavy checks. “Taking out aircraft just for painting purpose and letting capacity take a hit makes no sense. Also Vistara aircraft have a better cabin product than that of AI’s old planes,” said sources.Vistara had earlier reached out to passengers informing them about the transfer of frequent flyer miles to AI’s loyalty programme. The movement of personnel has already started, with many Vistara employees now operating from AI’s new Gurgaon headquarters.Are there chances that passengers who have booked on a certain class of Vistara, say business or premium economy, on a flight that has to operate after the date of merger being shifted to economy on the AI flight they take as the latter’s business may be full or it may not have a premium economy? “There are little chances of such things happening,” said sources.AI management had last considered toyed with the idea of postponing Vistara’s merger. The reason: They wanted AI planes to be upgraded first and till then retain Vistara as the better product carrier. However given mounting concerns among Vistara employees about AI officials getting all key posts in the merged airline, that plan was shelved. So even as AI remains very much a work in slow progress, the merger is now going to happen before the end of this calendar year.","The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India.

We intended that on the earlier (election) dates, people would have got 5 holidays and there would have been chances that people went for holidays or urgent work and this could have led to a decrease in the vote percentage...Congress keeps saying things without any reason,"" said BJP leader Anil Vij.The Election Commission on Saturdayrevised the polling day for Haryana from October 1 to October 5, and accordingly counting day for J&K and Haryana assembly elections from October 4 to October 8.The decision has been taken to honour both the voting rights and the traditions of the Bishnoi community , which has upheld a centuries-old practice of participating in the Asoj Amavasya festival celebration in remembrance of their Guru Jambheshwar, said the EC",The Election Commission on Saturdayrevised the polling day for Haryana from October 1 to October 5.

NEW DELHI: India is the most exciting and compelling market in the world today primarily due to its talent, infrastructure, community and knowledge, Times Internet Vice President and The Times of India Board Director Satyan Gajwani said on Saturday at the inaugural edition of The Economic Times World Leaders Forum (WLF) where the keynote address was delivered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""We live in an India that is the toast of global capitals. The image the country evokes is no longer that of the forlorn and the famished. It evokes that of a country racing ahead to be the third largest economy in the world, that of a country which supplies global corporations with chief executives, a country rapidly building world class physical and digital public infrastructure, a country that is home to business houses with global scale and ambitions and a country where every major business in the world is seeking a presence in, through high-tech global capability centres. It's a testament to the talent, infrastructure, community and knowledge, or what I call TICK, that India offers. India TICKs all the boxes,"" said Gajwani.Before inviting PM Modi for the key note address, Gajwani said the PM taught a billion people to dream big and shed the baggage of their past.""He's a father figure who guards the nation as an island of stability and growth in a troubled neighbourhood. He's a statesman who the world looks up to for solutions to intractable problems in times of crisis ... in many ways his life and career are intertwined with the destiny of Bharat,"" said the Times Internet VP.Noting that the PM took over India's mantle at a difficult time for the nation, Gajwani said: ""PM Modi gave the technology booster shot to an economy that was ambling along, convinced a sceptical world that we can Make in India, and made ease of doing business and ease of living mantras to work towards"".He also highlighted an ET report which stated that the manufacturing ecosystem of just one company — Apple — was on course to create 6,00,000 jobs in India by the end of this fiscal. ""More than half a million jobs by just one company. I believe this is just a demonstration of the potential of Make in India,"" said Gajwani.Talking about the success story of India, the Times Internet VP said: ""India is a role model for delivery at the grassroots. That’s in large measure because prime minister Modi believed technology is the answer and leveraged it to deliver benefits to the less fortunate in society. From micropayments to microchips, it’s been quite a journey. Global CEOs and opinion makers these days make it a point to have a cup of tea from a roadside stall at any remote village, just to enjoy the thrill of our universal electronic payment system and post it on Instagram."" Gajwani was referring to Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who shared a video earlier this year on Instagram with a Nagpur-based tea seller who is popularly known as ""Dolly Chaiwalla"", and praised India's innovation culture.","India is the most exciting and compelling market in the world today, says Times Internet Vice President Satyan Gajwani.

He also accused PM Modi of apologising just to get away with the controversy.""This is a political apology, a political moment.They are asking for an apology to get away with it. Apologisng will not compensate for the insult to Chhatrapati, it will never be enough. If the Prime Minister sincerely apologizes, then he should have apologized to the nation 5-10 years ago when 40 of our soldiers were killed in Pulwama, causing widespread grief,"" Raut said.""Forty soldiers were killed at once due to your failure. Even today, killings continue in Jammu and Kashmir, and the promise of homecoming for our Kashmiri Pandits has not been fulfilled; you should apologize for that too. You have lied so many times. You should apologise to the nation every day, but you haven't. This is Maharashtra; Maharashtra does not forgive anyone, especially in matters related to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .

He pointed out a pattern of favouritism towards certain contractors, subpar quality of work, and inaugurations timed to coincide with elections rather than genuine sentiment.On the incident, Sindhudurg guardian minister Ravindra Chavan, who holds the PWD portfolio, said, ""A case has been filed against the proprietor of the firm M/s Artistry, Jaydeep Apte, and structural consultant Chetan Patil (both involved in statue work) in Sindhudurg.""
