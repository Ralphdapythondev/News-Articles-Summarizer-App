took over:

SC

to

Bihar cops

NEW DELHI: To identify candidates who benefited from the NEET-UG question paper leak in Bihar and determine the spread of the leakage, Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the National Testing agency (NTA) to upload on its website by Saturday noon the centre-wise results of the examination taken by more than 23 lakh students competing for over 1 lakh MBBS seats.The CJI-led bench, however, asked NTA not to disclose names of candidates in the uploaded results. It said publication of these results was essential as the 44 petitioner students have no wherewithal to identify whether a centre-wise success pattern existed.This also ties in with the court's concern about ascertaining whether the leak was a localised affair or stretched across centres. The much-awaited hearing, in which the bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra appeared hewed to its position that it would not cancel the entrance test unless satisfied the leak was not limited to just one centre, saw the justices making it clear they would go deep into the malaise that allegedly compromised the integrity of the test. They also reiterated the larger interest of over 23 lakh students, many of whom belonged to poor or middle class families and strived for years to succeed in the examination.Significantly, although SC appeared to be going by the findings of the CBI probe, it also summoned evidence from Bihar Police which exposed the matter. ""The material collected by Bihar Police through the investigation and the report of Economic Offences Wing of Bihar Police, before the investigation was taken over by CBI, shall be filed in the court by 5pm on July 20,"" said the bench as it responded to the contention of the petitioners' counsel, senior advocate Narender Hooda, that NTA's stand was at variance with the findings of Bihar cops. SC scheduled the hearing for Monday.After perusing two probe status reports by CBI, SC said, ""It appears there was no systemic wrong... at Godhra (where re-examination was held). Wrongdoing happened at Hazaribag (where the sealed envelope of question paper was tampered with and photos of question paper was taken prior to examination on May 5) and Patna.""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained the modus operandi of the paper-leak gang and said they had taken advance money from parents and post-dated cheques running into lakhs for enabling their children to take advantage of the wrongdoing. He said the gang did it for money and never wanted the leaked paper to be circulated, or, to be precise, expose those who had paid money, as that would have led to cancellation of the examination, which would have been detrimental to their illicit business.Mehta said a photo of the question paper was taken out and the gang engaged seven question-solvers to provide answers within one hour on May 5 morning. The gang then called targeted students and made them memorise the answers. He said CBI has arrested the person who took a photo of the question paper at Oasis School (Hazaribag), its centre superintendent, three question-solvers and some of the gang members.The SG said the first 100 rankers are spread across 95 centres in 56 cities. He said the students who benefited from the localised leak would not exceed 150, that no benefit would be enured to them as they have been identified, and that necessary action would be taken against them.","Supreme Court orders National Testing agency to upload on its website by Saturday noon the centre-wise results of the examination taken by more than 23 lakh students competing for over 1 lakh MBBS seats.

Usha Chilukuri Vance , an Indian-origin litigator, is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump 's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections on Monday. Usha Vance carries rich Indian cultural values and has a strong legal background, making her a key figure in this political partnership.Usha Vance, daughter of Indian immigrants, is a litigator at a national law firm.She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in History and earned a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI. ""She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India,"" added Mason.Earlier, in an interview with Fox & Friends, Usha Chilukuri Vance and her husband talked about their different faiths and his potential candidacy for Vice President of the US.""I don't think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

'Assault on India's culture'

'It is a social crime'

'UP govt promoting untouchability'

'Decision to facilitate devotees'

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday defended the move of Muzaffarnagar police directing eateries on the Kanwar Yatra route to ""voluntarily display"" names of their owners and employees and slammed the opposition's ""misplaced outrage"" over the issue. This even as one of BJP's key allies, the Janata Dal (United) of Nitish Kumar, also opposed the police move and demanded that the order should be withdrawn.The Muzaffarnagar Police advisory evoked strong reactions from various quarters with some opposition leaders even drawing parallels to the Hitler era, Nazi's Germany and South Africa's Apartheid.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla slammed those objecting to the police order and said: ""Display of Halal certification to ensure Muslims' religious feelings are not hurt = Peak Secularism. Request to ALL eateries to comply with law & make proper disclosures of name to ensure that Kanwariyas' Astha is not hurt by false information- Peak Bigotry.""""What hypocrisy,"" Poonawalla said, stressing that everyone should have the right to choose the food they like during a religious 'yatra'. ""If Muslims can eat at a place which serves Halal food only, other devotees should also be allowed to choose to eat Satvik food during their religious yatra,"" he added.BJP leader Amit Malviya also slammed the opposition. ""If food is a choice, and restaurants, including some MNCs, delivery apps, catering to Muslim sensibilities, prominently display Halal compliance certificates, then why should it be any different for fasting Hindus (Kanwar Yatris in this case), who may want to eat at a pure veg restaurant, where the likelihood of them being served Satvik food is higher? Is giving Hindus equal right to choice a sin?"" he said in a post on X.Malviya claimed India’s ""secularism"" can’t be so fragile that a uniform order asking all eateries to display name and contact number of the owner/workers should disrupt it.""Also ask what necessitated this order? Particularly to those secularists, who have assumed that this order is discriminatory and against Muslims. Because they know that several Muslims acquire overtly Hindu names for their businesses, from coaching institutes to food joints, and indulge in not just violating religious sensibilities but also conversions and worse. We have already seen so many disgusting videos of vendors/workers spitting, urinating and more… "" he added.And while the BJP strongly defended the move of Muzaffarnagar Police, its ally at the Centre and in Bihar raised strong objections to the order. JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said ""Kanwar Yatra has been crossing through the areas of western Uttar Pradesh for ages and communal tension has not been reported. Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs as well welcome the pilgrims by setting up stalls. Muslim artisans are also involved in making the Kanwars... Such orders can increase communal tension.""Tyagi said the district administration should review its decision and take it back.""Police should investigate that no anti-social elements should be running any shops, but there should not be any discrimination on the basis of religion or caste. It increases the divide in the society. Such directives can increase communal tension. It should not be implemented,"" the JD(U) leader said.The Congress slammed the Muzaffarnagar Police order as an assault on India's culture and said those who wanted to decide who eats what, will now decide who buys what from whom. Hitting out at the BJP-RSS, the Congress also said the intention of such an order was to normalise economic boycott of Muslims.Congress's media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said the intention behind this is to find out who is a Hindu and who is a Muslim and to normalize the economic boycott of Muslims. ""Whether it is about economic boycott of a Hindu or economic boycott of a Muslim, we will not let it succeed,"" he added.Khera said the owners of many meat exporting companies are Hindus.""The way a Hindu exports meat, it remains meat, it does not become daal chawal. Similarly, if Altaf or Rashid is selling mango-guava, then mango-guava will not become meat,"" he added.Attacking the BJP-RSS, the Congress leader said they are attacking the Indian culture and trying to enter people's homes.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the Muzaffarnagar police order is a ""social crime"" and asked the courts to take suo motu cognisance of the matter.The former UP chief minister wrote on X, ""... And what if the name of the owner is Guddu, Munna, Chhotu or Fatte? What can you find out from these names? The honourable court should take suo motu cognizance of this matter and investigate the intentions of the government and take appropriate punitive action.""""Such an order is a social crime aimed at spoiling the peaceful atmosphere and harmony,"" he added.AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government and challenged UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to issue a written order in this regard.The Hyderabad MP called it a clear-cut ""discriminatory"" order and alleged that it shows that the government wants to make Muslims ""second-grade"" citizens in Uttar Pradesh and the entire country.""We condemn this (verbal order). This is a violation of Article 17 of the Constitution, which talks about untouchability. The Uttar Pradesh government is promoting untouchability. Ever since the order was given, the owners of 'dhabas' in Muzaffarnagar have removed muslim employees. It is clear discrimination of Muslims. Spirit of the Constitution is being hurt. It is against the right to life and right to livelihood,"" Owaisi said.The Muzaffarnagar Police have clarified that the intention of this order is not to create any kind of ""religious discrimination"" but only to facilitate the devotees.""During the Shravan Kanwar Yatra, a large number of Kanwariyas from neighbouring states, via Western Uttar Pradesh, collect water from Haridwar and pass through Muzaffarnagar district. During the holy month of Shravan, many people, especially Kanwariyas, abstain from certain food items in their diet,"" the Muzaffarnagar police stated.""In the past, such instances have come to light where some shopkeepers selling all types of food items on Kanwar Marg named their shops in such a way that it created confusion among the Kanwariyas and created a law and order situation. To prevent such a recurrence and in view of the faith of the devotees, hotels, dhabas and shopkeepers selling food items on Kanwar Marg have been requested to voluntarily display the names of their owners and employees. The intention of this order is not to create any kind of religious discrimination but only to facilitate the devotees passing through Muzaffarnagar district, counter allegations and save the law and order situation. This system has been prevalent in the past, too,"" it added.","Muzaffarnagar police ordered eateries on Kanwar Yatra route to ""voluntarily display"" names of their owners and employees. Opposition leaders drew parallels to Hitler era, Nazi's Germany and South Africa's Apartheid. BJP slammed the opposition's ""misplaced outrage"" over the issue.

Andhra Pradesh versus Karnataka over quota

The Karnakata government has decided to put the controversial job reservation bill on hold for the time being facing massive pushback from industries. Chief minister Siddaramaiah said the bill will be revisited and the future course of action will be decided in the coming days. ""The bill approved by the cabinet to provide reservation for Kannadigas in private sector organizations, industries and enterprises has been temporarily put on hold,"" the chief minister issued a statement on X.The Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024 was passed in the Cabinet meeting on Monday.It said any industry, factory or other establishments shall appoint 50 per cent of local candidates in management categories and 70 per cent in non-management categories.If the candidates do not have secondary school certificates with Kannada as a language, they would have to pass a Kannada proficiency test, the bill stipulated.The Kannada-must provision drew flak from industry leaders as they argued that Bengaluru will lose skilled talent if such a bill is adopted. Another genius move from Govt of Karnataka. ""Mandate LOCAL RESERVATION & APPOINT GOVT OFFICER IN EVERY COMPANY to monitor. This will scare Indian IT & GCCs. Short sighted,"" Assocham co-chairman RK Mishra said.Karnataka's move is similar to a bill introduced by the Haryana government, mandating 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs to residents of the state. It was, however, struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on November 17, 2023.A bill enforcing 50 per cent reservation for administrative posts and 75 per cent for non-administrative posts for Kannadigas in private industries is the bone of contention.Initially, the government was defensive about the move of prioritizing the Kannadigas as Siddaramaiah said the government does not want the Kannadigas to be deprived of job opportunities in the state. ""We are a pro-Kannada government. Our priority is to look after the welfare of the Kannadigas,"" Siddaramaiah said.With the industries expressing concerns that they may have to shut shops in Karnataka if Kannada becomes a qualifier for jobs, Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh did not miss the opportunity to try to lure away the industry honchos.""We understand your disappointment. We welcome you to expand or relocate your businesses to our IT, IT services, AI and data center cluster at Vizag.

Andhra Pradesh is ready to welcome you. Please get in touch!"" Nara Lokesh posted.Karnataka minister Priyanka Kharge replied to Lokesh and asked whether the minister does not want Andhra Pradesh companies to employ Andhra people.""Karnataka has always excelled in the most sector due to our consistent relationships and consultative approach with industry leaders, advisory bodies, and consortiums in drafting policies and schemes. As with previous initiatives, this draft bill will include recommendations from our industry partners,"" Kharge wrote.""Our goal is to develop a global workforce using local talent, while also encouraging global investments and creating employment opportunities.""""By the way, wouldn’t you also like to ensure that every company invested in Andhra Pradesh employs deserving, trained and skilled individuals from Andhra Pradesh?

Lack of intelligence contributing to casualties in J&K anti-terror ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lack-of-intelligence-contributing-to-casualties-in-jk-anti-terror-ops/articleshow/111845106.cms,"NEW DELHI: The lack of good “human intelligence” and “signal intelligence” continues to lead to higher casualties among the security forces in counter-terror operations in the Jammu region , where terrorists well versed in military-style ambushes are taking advantage of low troop density due to the relocation of forces to the China front.After a review of the terror surge in the south of the Pir Panjal range by a flurry of meetings, which included a PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security on Thursday, officials said “additional Army and central police forces as well as technology” are now being deployed in the Jammu region but it would take some time for the situation to stabilize.“It is a huge area, with a tough mountain and jungle terrain along with caves and other hideouts. There are around 35-40 battle-hardened terrorists active in the Jammu region, who are operating in small teams. Intelligence inputs say most of them are of Pakistan-origin and belong to the Jaish-e-Mohammed,” a senior officer said.The motivated terrorists, armed with modern weapons, ammunition and encrypted communication equipment including Chinese-origin “ultra-sets”, have caused a series of setbacks to the Army in the Jammu region in six to seven attacks this year alone.The latest attack being the one in Doda on Monday in which four soldiers, including a captain, were killed. In some cases, the terrorists have even released videos of the bodies of soldiers being mutilated after the ambushes.Overall, the security forces including the Army have lost around 125 personnel in J&K since 2021, with at least 52 of them being killed in the Jammu region. “Pakistan has clearly shifted the focus of terrorism from the Kashmir Valley to the Jammu region. Earlier, terrorist activities were largely restricted to the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch but have now spread to other places like Reasi, Doda, Bhaderwah, Kathua and Udhampur as well,” another officer said.The Army’s shifting of specialized counter-insurgency troops, including the “Uniform Force” of the Rashtriya Rifles, from the region to eastern Ladakh after China’s multiple intrusions into eastern Ladakh in May 2020 has led to a major operational and intelligence gap there.“The humint ( human intelligence ) from the locals and others has virtually dried up. It takes time and sustained effort to build a humint network, which is critical for counter-insurgency operations,” the officer said.Moreover, many terrorists have also begun to use specialized ultra-sets and other highly encrypted telecom equipment, which are tough to intercept, since last year. “So, the absence of credible humint is compounded by the relative lack of sigint ( signal intelligence ) as well,” he said.“Local politics has also alienated a section of the Gujjars and Bakarwals, who act as eyes and ears of the security forces. Pakistan is exploiting all this, having kept the terror training infrastructure on its territory and PoK intact,” he added.It also seems that the security forces have largely failed to draw tactical lessons from the ambushes laid by terrorists in the Jammu region, which has easier infiltration routes from across the border as compared to the Kashmir region.","Terrorists well versed in military-style ambushes are taking advantage of low troop density due to the relocation of forces to the China front.

2 soldiers wounded in Doda camp attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-soldiers-wounded-in-doda-camp-attack/articleshow/111844836.cms,"JAMMU: Two soldiers were wounded in a terrorist attack around 3am Thursday on a temporary security camp established in a govt school in Kastigarh area of Doda district of J&K. It is part of the Jammu region that has been plagued by a series of terrorism-linked violence recently, including the July 15 shootout in which four men from 10 Rashtriya Rifles lost their lives.This was the eighth gunfight with terrorists in Doda since June 11-12.Sources said the latest assault could have been carried out by the same group of suspected Pakistani terrorists tied to Kashmir Tigers, a shadow group of Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was believed to be involved in the July 15 fatal attack on a search party in Desa, a thickly forested and mountainous area about 55km from Doda town. Kashmir Tigers claimed responsibility for both the Desa attack and a July 8 ambush on a two-truck military patrol in Kathua.It is estimated that 20-25 “foreign” terrorists, armed with sophisticated weapons such as American M4 carbines, are active in Doda district, the sources said. They operate in small groups of three to four within a 30-40 square km area. “The terrorists know the topography well and are exploiting the thick forest cover for their attacks,” a source said.Of the 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists active in J&K, nearly 55 to 60 are in Jammu zone, according to official sources. Since Oct 2021, at least 49 security personnel have been killed in the region — including 39 from the Army and one from IAF.Despite ongoing seek-and-kill operations supported by drones, helicopters, and military dogs, challenging terrain and adverse weather conditions have hindered security efforts. The remote and rugged landscape, dotted with deep gorges, thick woods, mountain caves, and other natural hideouts, provides ample cover for terrorists operating in small groups.The capability of these heavily armed groups to coordinate attacks remains a major challenge forsecurity forces . This was evidenced by the July 8 ambush on the military patrol that resulted in the deaths of five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles in Kathua.Intelligence sources said foreign terrorists are employing new methods for border-crossing and executing attacks in Jammu region. These methods include tunnelling beneath the fence to slip through the heavily guarded border and using advanced technology such as iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery.DIG (Doda Kishtwar-Ramban range) Shridhar Patil visited the site in Kastigarh. He said a coordinated manhunt is underway, but refrained from sharing detailed information.Despite heavy rain, an IAF helicopter promptly evacuated the two wounded soldiers to the military hospital in Udhampur for treatment. Security forces repulsed the attack with counterfire lasting more than an hour, according to security sources. The terrorists managed to escape, using the dense foliage and darkness to their advantage.Village defence guards (VDGs) are assisting security forces in the counteroffensive. On Wednesday, VDGs opened fire after observing suspicious movement in Kralaan village of Doda.Authorities warned people against providing shelter, food, or aiding the terrorists in hiding and navigating the area undetected. Police have arrested two men, including Showket Ali, who allegedly provided food, shelter, and WiFi access to three terrorists before the July 15 attack in Desa. However, it couldn’t be ascertained whether the terrorists Ali allegedly assisted were involved in the attack.",Two soldiers were wounded in a terrorist attack around 3am Thursday on a temporary security camp in Kastigarh area of Doda district of J&K.

Drawing inferences from the defeat, party found infighting a prime reason for the defeat in which even CM candidate Raghubar Das lost his seat to Saryu Roy, who contested as an independent candidate after he fell out with the former as he was denied ticket from Jamshedpur West. Das had won Jamshedpur East five times in a row and Jamshedpur East was traditionally a BJP bastion as it was earlier won by Dinanath Pandey of the same party.In an effort to seal all loopholes, senior BJP leaders have been assigned task to honour the grassroots workers. Former state president and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Parkash, along with Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Baran Mahato, felicitated workers of Potka segment on Sunday. This reserved assembly seat is one of the six under Jamshedpur Lok Sabha. Earlier a similar function was held for workers of Jugsalai reserved seat.“All credit for the party's victory from Jamshedpur seat goes to the grassroots cadres.

"Working towards launching 4G/5G services on BSNL/MTNL ""at the earliest"": Scindia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-towards-launching-4g/5g-services-on-bsnl/mtnl-at-the-earliest-scindia/articleshow/111843450.cms,"NEW DELHI: Promising to launch 4G and 5G services in BSNL and MTNL “at the earliest”, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday said the turnaround efforts of the state-run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis, “and not monthly or weekly”.The minister also said that the govt stands behind the Sovereign Guarantee Bonds of MTNL, and there will be no defaults, even as its operations will be transferred to BSNL.“What we have said is very clear that MTNL’s operations will be transferred to BSNL. Monetisation of assets will take place to pay off the liabilities. In the interim of monetisation of assets and some bonds getting due, the sovereign guarantee bonds stand good. Government of India stands behind those bonds and there will be no default.”Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress curtain-raiser event here, Scindia said despite delays, people should have “national pride” and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies and not something which is sourced from foreign vendors.“Develop a sense of national pride… The easy for us would have been to pick up technologies (from global vendors), and do what others do. But we feel that India must not be just a supplier of services, but also of products. So, we chose the harder way, and decided to develop the India 4G stack ourselves.”A consortium of Tata-run Tejas and TCS and public sector C-DOT has been working on the complex technologies to develop 4G and 5G telecom infrastructure that will be deployed on BSNL and MTNL networks. “Let me guarantee. We are on track to deploy one lakh RANs (radio access networks) towards this effort.”Scindia said efforts of the govt have been to develop technologies within India which will be used not only for domestic use, but also for exports. “From hardly anything a decade back, export of telecom equipment last year was to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.”The minister also said that the govt wants to be a facilitator in enabling the growth of the sector, against acting as a regulator. He said after leapfrogging and witnessing rapid growth in 5G, India is now working to be a leader in the development of 6G technologies. “A country that followed the world in 4G, walked with it in 5G, will now lead when it comes to 6G.”Scindia said that India is now working on encouraging the development of apps and solutions for 5G that would be deployed in rural areas.On cybersecurity, the minister said that as India develops on the digital front, there is a looming threat on the front of cyber security. “Wars today are not only fought on land, but also on the cloud. It is important to protect the country, the citizens, and businesses when it comes to cybersecurity.”","Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said turnaround efforts of state- run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis. He said despite delays, people should have ‘national pride’ and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111843467,imgsize-776618,width-400,resizemode-4/111843467.jpg"
