What changes as India reverts to 2020 LAC patrolling terms?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-changes-as-india-reverts-to-2020-lac-patrolling-terms/articleshow/114443394.cms,"Photo/PTI

Areas Of Strategic Value

On Boil Since

2020 Clashes

A Wide-Ranging Dispute

After long negotiations, India and China have finally agreed to return to the patrolling arrangements along the LAC in eastern Ladakh that were in place before the Galwan clashes in 2020. The agreement covers the areas of Depsang and Demchok.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had recently said that about 75 per cent of “disengagement problems” with China had been sorted out and that the key issue was the increasing militarisation of the frontier .“Now, those negotiations are going on. We made some progress... We still have some things to do,” he had said.Following the foreign ministry’s announcement, EAM Jaishankar said the two countries had “gone back to where the situation was in 2020”. “We can say that the disengagement process with China has been completed... There are areas which for various reasons after 2020 because they had blocked us so we had blocked them. So what has happened is we have reached an understanding, which will allow the patrolling,” he said.There was no specific mention of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along the border in Ladakh and there was neither any statement from Beijing on the matter.Demchok is close to the southernmost part of the LAC in Ladakh (see map), near the state border with Himachal Pradesh. A village in the region was the site of a Chinese incursion during the 1962 conflict but PLA troops did not venture beyond. It was the first place where China prevented Indian authorities from building civic infrastructure, including a road.Depsang Plains is a flat area near Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in the northwest portion of the disputed Aksai Chin region in UT Ladakh. The disputed area had been occupied by China until India began making headway into the region and now has a road leading to it. Because of the flat terrain, it allows for easy movement of troops and vehicles, including tanks.Galwan Valley , where Shyok and Galwan rivers meet, was the site of clashes in 1962 and is a key strategic area. India’s Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road, which leads to DBO — a military base with an airstrip — passes near the valley. For China, the Galwan region provides a vantage point overlooking the road to DBO.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday the agreement was thrashed out by Indian and Chinese negotiators after weeks of talks aimed at resolving the issues that arose after the Chinese military’s action in eastern Ladakh in 2020.Indian and Chinese troops first clashed on May 5, 2020, on the north bank of the Pangong Tso lake. There was a major clash on the night of June 15 between an Indian patrol and PLA troops in Galwan Valley with casualties on both sides.Amid claims and counter-claims regarding the capture of Indian territory in May and June 2020, there were satellite images showing China constructing bunkers and trenches and setting up tents along Pangong Tso lake. It even reportedly built a pier on the lake for boats. After the 2020 clashes, China aggressively built up its presence along the LAC in Ladakh, including by bringing in troops and armoured vehicles.LAC came into existence following the 1962 Sino-Indian war. But it is not properly demarcated and has been the focus of a long-standing dispute between the two neighbours, involving areas stretching from Arunachal in the east to Ladakh in the north.LAC divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims. According to India, the de facto border is 3,488km long, but China says it is considerably shorter. Beijing claims about 90,000sqkm of India’s territory in the northeast, including in Arunachal, while New Delhi says 38,000sqkm of land in China-occupied Aksai Chin should be part of Ladakh.The 2020 clashes led to a troop build-up by both India and China, but they have since withdrawn forces from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso lake, Gogra and Galwan Valley.","Indian and Chinese troops first clashed on May 5, 2020, on the north bank of the Pangong Tso lake.

DEHRADUN: A traders’ body that had issued a resolution asking 15 Muslim families to leave Khansar town in Chamoli by December 31 backtracked on its stance on Monday soon after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi condemned the move and sought answers from the Uttarakhand government.Around 15 Muslim families are living in Maithan’s market area, some of whom have been there for over 30 years.These families, many of whom work as muleteers, masons, and daily wage labourers, had reportedly not faced any issues until recently.In a post on a social media platform, Owaisi criticised the resolution, saying, “Members of the community are being treated as untouchables in India,” and directly asked the state authorities to respond. On Monday, Khansar’s Vyapar Mandal Maithan representatives were summoned to the Gairsain police station to discuss the issue. After the meeting, the association claimed they were not targeting any specific religion or caste.Vikram Singh Negi, the association’s president, said, “Our message was meant for those who have been living here without proper police verification or under false identities. The deadline was for them to complete their verification, as well as for landlords to ensure that their tenants’ details were verified.”Negi also said the resolution had been “misinterpreted.” He added, “We have lived here in peace and harmony for years. Our aim is to maintain that harmony and avoid any unfortunate incidents in the future.”Chamoli SP Sarvesh Panwar told TOI, “When we summoned the traders’ representatives, they denied targeting any specific community. We have made it clear that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands and disturb the peace.”",Traders' body had issued a resolution asking 15 Muslim families to leave Khansar town in Chamoli by December 31.

More than a thousand kilometres away, his bride Andleep Zahra also radiated in a red sharara paired with shimmering jewellery.The only thing amiss was the quintessential pomp and show of the nikah ceremony.Amid strained relations between India and Pakistan, the elder son of Tahseen Shahid, a BJP corporator from Jaunpur , married a resident of Lahore in an online nikah following visa delay. In yet another example of cross-border love , Shahid had fixed the marriage of his son, employed with an Indian e-commerce company, with his elder sister's daughter, a professor with a private university in Lahore. Despite applying for visa, Haider was heartbroken as he couldn't obtain it due to the diplomatic deep freeze between the two nations.The situation turned worse for the families when Zahra's mother, Rana Yasmin Zaidi, was admitted to the ICU of a Pakistan hospital following health concerns. Left with no choice, Shahid had to conduct the ceremony online at an imambara on Oct 18. Shia religious leader Maulana Mahfoozul Hasan Khan officiated the nikah, with the bride present in Lahore saying ""Qubool Hai"" in a virtual ceremony. Both the families exchanged pleasantries through video conferencing. An LED screen with a laptop was also installed at the venue.Maulana Mahfoozul Hasan Khan said virtual nikah is only possible when maulanas from both sides are able to conduct the ceremony together. Just like a traditional nikah, the woman's consent is also essential for online ceremony.Talking to TOI over phone, Shahid said: ""My ‘phuphu' (paternal aunty's husband) shifted to Lahore during the Partition. In 1986, my elder sister got married to his son. To take the relation forward, I decided to marry my elder son to Zahra.""Talking about the hostile relations between the two countries and no signs of a thaw in the strained ties, he said: ""Our personal relations should not come in the way of cross-border tension.""He said: ""By applying for a visa with the Indian nikahnama, we hope to facilitate the process.... Allah is benevolent… We pray that my ‘bahu' gets her Indian visa without any hassle.""The groom said, ""We will request the government to offer a hassle-free visa process. This will not only help people like us but also boost the tourism of both the countries.""BJP MLC Brijesh Singh Prishu and other guests attended the wedding ceremony and congratulated the groom's family.","The elder son of Tahseen Shahid, a BJP corporator from Jaunpur, married a resident of Lahore in an online nikah.

Uttarakhand UCC: Live-in relationship registration mandatory within one month of implementation in Uttarakhand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uniform-civil-code-ucc-live-in-relationship-registration-mandatory-within-one-month-of-implementation-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/114394251.cms,"CM Pushkar Singh Dhami

Key points:

DEHRADUN: The Uniform Civil Code ( UCC ), expected to be implemented on November 9, the state foundation day, this year, includes provisions that make it mandatory for couples to register their marriages within a six-month time span. A month's time has been given to live-in couples to register themselves from the time the law comes into existence in the Himalayan state.A source, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to TOI, “It would be mandatory for couples to get their live-in relationship registered within one month of notification, or they would face punishment as per the provisions. Besides, the proposed law also suggests the role of landlords and house owners who are renting their property to such couples. If they deliberately hide facts, action may be initiated against them too.”The UCC also suggests action against those who either delay the registration, provide false information, or do not register their live-in relationship.The law mentions, “Whoever stays in a live-in relationship for more than one month from the date of entering into such a relationship without submitting the statement of such relationship shall be punished on conviction by a Judicial Magistrate with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with a fine not exceeding Rs 10,000 or with both.”Similarly, false information can draw imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with a fine not exceeding Rs 25,000, or with both. In instances where a couple fails to provide information, there is a provision of a jail term which may extend to six months or with a fine not exceeding Rs 25,000, or with both.Any child of a live-in relationship shall be a legitimate child of the couple, and in case a woman is deserted, she can seek maintenance. While the secrecy of live-in couples would be maintained, authorities would inform the parents of such couples who are in the age bracket of 18 to 21 years.Similarly, couples not registering their marriage within six months of the UCC notification would not be eligible for the benefits of govt schemes. Even those who have already registered their marriages in other states would be required to update their record in Uttarakhand too. “It is a simple process which can be easily done through the mobile app developed by the authorities. One will not have to take circles of govt offices to get themselves registered,” he added.Besides, the report submitted to the CM suggests that parents would also get a share in the movable and immovable property of their children in case of death.“The panel received thousands of suggestions, in which elderly people claimed that after the death of their son, the entire property went to their daughter-in-law, and they were left alone in villages. The problem is profound in Uttarakhand as youngsters of the hills migrate to cities and other states in search of jobs. Thousands of such parents raised this issue before the panel. Now the panel has suggested property rights to parents as well in such cases,” the source said, adding, “In case of the death of an earning son, his wife, two children, and parents would be regarded as different units. Therefore, the movable and immovable assets would be divided into four parts. The move has been initiated under the UCC to ensure that the parents are not left ignored.”The will-making process has been made simple and easier through a mobile app. “The process has been made so simple that a person can make changes easily at any time while using the mobile app. However, all these matters are being scrutinised by the state legal department , and they can make the required changes,” he added.The panel, headed by Shatrughan Singh, already handed over its report to CM Pushkar Singh Dhami on October 18, and it has been forwarded to the legal department for scrutiny. The next step would be the training of govt officials and employees, and following the cabinet approval, the law would be notified in the state. The UCC Bill was tabled in the state assembly on February 6 and passed on February 7. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (Retd) gave his nod on February 28, and President Droupadi Murmu gave her approval on March 11.1. All marriages need to be registered within six month of UCC notification2. Live-in relationships to be registered within one month3. Responsibility on house owners, landlords also to inform authorities about tenants in live-in relationship4. In case of death of earning child, parents also to get share in property5.

NEW DELHI: Residents of Rohini 's Prashant Vihar woke up to unusual vibrations on Sunday morning, jolted by a thunderous sound.Fearing an earthquake, they rushed outside, only to be met with a chemical-like odour and thick white smoke, leaving them in shock.No one was injured although there were around a dozen men near the site.CCTV footage from near the CRPF school captured the moment when the explosion disrupted the morning calm, shattering window panes in nearby buildings.In the evening, a Telegram group allegedly linked to banned outfit Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) claimed responsibility, posting a message with a veiled reference to Lawrence Bishnoi along with CCTV footage of the blast.Advocate Shashank Goswami said: ""When I came out of my house, I was unable to see anything. There was a pungent smell of burning,"" he said. "" There is a court and Delhi Police 's unit office nearby. The area is highly secure, with CCTV cameras installed at various spots.

Pakistan-based PAFF links Kashmir tunnel attack to Chinese interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-based-paff-links-kashmir-tunnel-attack-to-chinese-interests/articleshow/114436935.cms,"A policeman guards during the funeral of Kashmiri doctor Shahnawaz who was among those killed when terrorists fired at people working on a tunnel project in Kashmir, Monday, October 21, 2024. (AP)

SRINAGAR: A Chinese angle surfaced Monday in a statement by Pakistan-based terrorist outfit People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) following the mass shooting on the campsite of a tunnel-construction company in Gagangir village of central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district Sunday night that left a doctor and six workers dead. The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba , claimed responsibility for the attack.In its statement, PAFF praised TRF for what it called a “strategic attack” on workers engaged in building the Z-Morh tunnel. PAFF claimed the attack aimed to disrupt Indian military deployments toward the eastern border, stating it was “against our military interests and those of our Chinese friends”.While it’s known that China and Pakistan have strategic cooperation, officials said there’s no evidence to support Beijing’s involvement beyond the statement by PAFF. They said the reference to “Chinese friends” is a rhetorical attempt by PAFF to align their goals with China’s interests.The 6.5km-long tunnel on the Srinagar-Leh highway is a critical infrastructure project designed to provide all-weather connectivity between Kashmir and Ladakh. The tunnel, being constructed by UP-based APCO Infratech , is slated for inauguration in early Nov. Officials said the project’s timeline remains unchanged.“Military projects in an occupied territory are death traps. Hence, every sane-minded person should avoid them,” PAFF said. However, officials countered that such infrastructure in sensitive regions are dual-use, so characterising the tunnel solely as a military project might be misleading.TRF claimed its Falcon Squad targeted the construction site, describing the project as one intended primarily for military transportation. It reiterated its warnings to locals and non-locals to avoid working on “illegal projects”. The group expressed regret for civilian casualties but warned of further attacks on similar infrastructure efforts.According to intelligence officials, the attack was carried out under the orders of TRF chief Sheikh Sajjad Gul, who carries a Rs 10 lakh bounty announced by NIA in 2022. Around 8.15 pm, two to three Pakistani terrorists armed with automatic weapons stormed the campsite, targeting workers who had gathered for dinner in the mess area.The victims included three workers from Bihar — Faheem Nasir, Mohammad Hanif, and Abdul Kaleem — along with Anil Shukla from Madhya Pradesh, Gurmeet Singh from Punjab, architectural engineer Shashi Bhushan Abrol from Jammu, and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar from Budgam district in Kashmir.Widespread condemnation emerged across Kashmir, with rallies and candlelit marches expressing solidarity with the victims’ families. A notable march in Tangmarg, led by the sub-divisional magistrate in collaboration with local associations, saw residents from various backgrounds participate in a peaceful demonstration. Similar events took place in Boniyar and Pulwama, where community leaders like Shoaib Pathan and Mudasir Dar condemned the violence.Residents of slain physician Shahnawaz Dar’s village in Budgam district shouted slogans against CM Omar Abdullah for not visiting his home to offer his condolences. Ministers Javid Dar and Sakina Itoo visited the family in the evening.A team from NIA arrived in Gagangir Monday to investigate whether cross-border outfits were directly involved in the attack, marking it as the deadliest terrorist attack in 2024 after the June 9 ambush in Reasi district, which killed nine pilgrims.Security forces launched a manhunt in the forests surrounding Gagangir to locate the attackers. They are intensifying efforts to secure sensitive projects, especially those with strategic importance along the eastern front.J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha condemned the attack and vowed retaliation. “Security forces will avenge these deaths and ensure the terrorists pay a heavy price,” he said. Sinha also criticized Pakistan for “persisting in killing innocent people” to disrupt peace in the region.The LG announced financial aid for the victims’ families, with Rs 6 lakh from the govt and Rs 15 lakh in immediate relief from the construction firm APCO Infratech. Each family will also receive five years of the deceased worker’s salary. Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will also be provided to the wounded.Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expressed deep sorrow over the deaths of three workers from his state and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh for each family.Politicians across the spectrum condemned the attack. National Conference president Farooq Abdullah urged Pakistan to stop targeting civilians if it wished to improve ties with India. “Kashmir will not become Pakistan. Let us live with dignity,” he said. “How can dialogue take place if innocent people continue to be killed?”Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the attack, calling it a “grim reminder of the unending cycle of violence” in Kashmir. “Islam, like all religions, deplores such inhuman behaviour,” he said.","A Chinese angle surfaced Monday in a statement by Pakistan-based terrorist outfit People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) PAFF claimed the attack aimed to disrupt Indian military deployments toward the eastern border.

Son’s IAS dream shattered in Kashmir; Karva Chauth turns to mourning in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sons-ias-dream-shattered-in-kashmir-karva-chauth-turns-to-mourning-in-jammu/articleshow/114437131.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Amid grief and disbelief, two families — one from Kashmir ’s Budgam district and the other from Jammu — find themselves bound by an unimaginable tragedy. What was meant to be a festive time of Karva Chauth for architectural designer Shashi Bhushan Abrol’s wife and children, and a hopeful return to routine life for Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s family, has now become a period of mourning and shattered dreams.Sunday’s terrorist attack in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district robbed them of their loved ones, plunging moments of joy into an abyss of sorrow. Abrol and Dar were employees of construction company APCO Infratech and among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.In Naidgam village of Budgam, the air was heavy with grief as 52-year-old Dar was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard Monday. His family — his mother, wife, and three children — remained stunned by the loss. “My son, where have you gone?” wailed his mother.One of the most heartbreaking moments came from his teenage son Mohsin Dar, who revealed how his father had been his greatest supporter. “I wanted to become an IAS officer , and he had promised to help me fulfill this dream. Now that dream is gone,” he said.The timing of the physician’s death added another layer of heartbreak — just days earlier, he had celebrated the wedding of his daughter. He had been scheduled to return home to Budgam to participate in after-wedding ceremonies, but fate had other plans.The loss has shaken the entire community. “Dr Sahib was a man of honour, a professional who served us with humility and faith,” said Ghulam Mohammad Dar, a local elder. “We were just celebrating his daughter’s wedding, and now we’re mourning his death.”The village condemned the attackers and called for justice. “This loss is not just personal; it is a blow to humanity,” said a resident. “The ones responsible must be brought to justice.”Over 300km away, the Abrol family in Jammu is grappling with the same nightmare. Shashi Abrol’s wife Ruchi had kept a Karva Chauth fast, praying for her husband’s long life. But instead of breaking her fast with a loving conversation, she received news of his death.Ruchi, her voice choked with grief, recounted her last conversation with her husband. “He called me in the evening, and everything seemed normal. I told him I would call again after finishing the temple rituals. But after that, his phone went silent.”It was only late that night — as Ruchi eagerly waited for a video call from her husband to break the fast — that the family learned of the tragedy through media reports. “We were all trying to comfort her, but we had no idea what had happened,” Ruchi’s sister-in-law Divya said.Married for 20 years, Shashi leaves behind his parents, wife, and two children.The family is left with not only their grief but also practical challenges. “Shashi was the sole breadwinner,” said his father Jagdish Raj Abrol. “His wife is a simple housewife. How will she raise the children alone?”Divya said Shashi’s dream was to see his son become an engineer. “He last came home two months ago to help with his son’s engineering college admission. His biggest hope was to see him succeed, but now everything is uncertain.”In the midst of their pain, the Abrol and Dar families shared the same plea: that those responsible for this tragedy be held accountable, and that the government extend support to help them rebuild wrecked lives. Still, they know no amount of justice can replace the fathers, sons, and husbands they lost — men whose love, dreams, and hopes for their families were stolen in a moment of senseless violence.","Shashi Bhushan Abrol and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar were among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.

Khar Gymkhana chief links ‘conversion’ row to managing committee polls later this month

Mumbai: Khar Gymkhana on Sunday terminated the playing membership of India women's team batter Jemimah Rodrigues following allegations that her father booked a club hall using her membership for religious activities. The decision was taken at an AGM on Sunday. Rodrigues, a Bandra resident who has played three Tests, 30 ODIs and 104 T20Is for India, became the first woman cricketer to be granted Khar Gymkhana membership in March 2023.Jemimah and her father Ivan were unavailable for comment.A managing committee member said Ivan, linked to an evangelical group called Brother Manuel Ministries , booked the banquet hall for over a year for ""meetings related to religious conversions"".Khar Gymkhana president Vivek Devnani denied the allegations and accused rivals of indulging in politics ahead of the club’s upcoming elections.Confirming that India batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ membership at Khar Gymkhana was terminated, Devnani said the honorary three-year membership was revoked after a resolution passed at a general body meeting. “A resolution validly passed at such a meeting will always be given effect since the will of our members will always reign supreme,” he said.However, he cautioned that a needless controversy was being created against Ivan and Jemimah as “Khar Gymkhana is scheduled to have its managing committee and trustee elections later this month. These allegations are being made with political motives. No evidence has been offered for any alleged wrongdoing. I would request and trust our wider body of members and the media to be cautious in relying on misrepresentations and falsehoods,” Devnani said.Club members making the allegations are equally firm. Shiv Malhotra, a managing committee member and former vice-president, said, “Though Jemimah was granted the membership, her father exploited this privilege by booking the banquet hall for meetings related to religious conversions. From March 2023 to Nov 2024, the hall was predominantly booked on weekends, preventing other members from securing reservations for their events. This misuse extended to providing discounted rates, and in some cases, security deposit was waived,” he said.He said this issue triggered a backlash from managing committee members. “The president was compelled to recover over Rs 3.5 lakh in arrears from Jemimah for 35 events. Rules of Khar Gymkhana explicitly prohibit use of its facilities for religious propagation,” he added. The action was taken following a motion moved by past president Nitin Gadekar, demanding accountability.“Following discussion, general body unanimously decided to revoke Jemimah’s honorary playing membership due to misuse of privileges extended to her by the club,” Malhotra said.Gadekar said, “How can our club president allow such a thing to happen without the managing committee being aware of any of this?” He said the president had waived the deposit to be paid when these events were booked in the name of Rodrigues. “I took it up at the AGM yesterday. Everyone agreed that while an inquiry must be initiated, Jemimah’s club membership must be terminated immediately,” he added.","India batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ membership at Khar Gymkhana was terminated.

(PTI)

NEW DELHI: The India-China agreement on troop "" patrolling arrangements "" along the LAC, which will lead to disengagement at the remaining major faceoffs at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh, will begin to take concrete shape on the ground in seven to 10 days.This, however, represents just the first step towards restoring normalcy along LAC.""China should also agree on the subsequent long-drawn process of de-escalation and de-induction of forward deployed troops, which is imperative for the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020,"" a defence and security establishment source told TOI.The new patrolling pact, in effect, means Chinese troops will stop actively blocking Indian soldiers at the 'Bottleneck' area in the strategically-located Depsang Plains , which is around 18km inside what India considers its own territory, and vice versa, the source said. ""There will be relocation of the temporary positions/posts that both sides had set up. Similar disengagement will be carried out at Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south,"" he added.There was no clarity on whether the planned pullback from the military standoff by a few kilometers will allow Indian troops ""full access"" to their traditional patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in Depsang, which is towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie and Karakoram Pass in the north.With both sides having overlapping claims in the region, sources said ""patrolling will be done in all areas"", with the frequency being twice a month. ""The two sides will coordinate patrols and limit it to 15 soldiers each to avoid confrontations,"" said a source.China, incidentally, claims as much as 972 square km of territory in the Depsang region, which is near its critical Western Highway G-219 connecting Tibet to Xinjiang.The two armies had earlier created no-patrol buffer zones, varying from 3km to 10km largely on the Indian side of LAC, after troop disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last taking place in Sept 2022. The buffer zones, which were supposed to be temporary arrangements, and the confrontation at Depsang and Demchok meant Indian troops could not access 26 of their 65 PPs in eastern Ladakh, which begin from the Karakoram Pass in the north and go down to Chumar in the south.There was also no response to queries on whether China agreed to the new patrolling pact in eastern Ladakh in lieu of India granting some concessions in Arunachal Pradesh. Defence ministry, on being contacted by TOI, refused to comment.After People's Liberation Army 's multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in 2020, China had forward-deployed over 50,000 troops and heavy weapon systems along LAC there. Beijing subsequently upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) of LAC by deploying another 90,000 soldiers there. ""China continues to maintain its forward deployed troops along LAC,"" another source said.","The India-China agreement on troop "" patrolling arrangements "" along the LAC will lead to disengagement at the remaining major faceoffs at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh.

SHIMLA: After getting a go-ahead from Himachal Pradesh waqf board, the Sanjauli mosque committee on Monday started demolition of the three illegal storeys of the mosque in Shimla.The court of Shimla municipal commissioner, Bhupender Kumar Attri, had on Oct 5 ordered the Muslim Welfare Committee to raze the top three storeys of the mosque within two months at its own expense.Mosque committee president Mohammed Latif said, “The committee has hired labourers to remove the tin roof of the building as well as the attic. The order of the municipal commissioner court is being followed in letter and spirit, but it may take three to four months to raze the illegally constructed portions of the mosque because of lack of funds.”Welcoming the move, Himachal CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said: “It would be the first such example where people of the Muslim community have themselves come forward to maintain peace and brotherhood in the state. People of every caste, community and religion live honourably and peacefully in Himachal Pradesh, and everybody has the right to work in the state.”Urban local bodies minister Vikramaditya Singh said if the committee faced funds crunch or wanted more time for demolition, it could move an application before the municipal commissioner’s court, which could take a decision as per law.Devbhoomi Sangharsh Samiti, which led the protests for the demolition of unauthorised portions of the mosque, also hailed the decision. Meanwhile, HP high court, while hearing a petition filed by the local residents, directed Shimla municipal commissioner court to decide within eight weeks the main pending case regarding Sanjauli mosque’s unauthorised construction.","After getting a go-ahead from Himachal Pradesh waqf board, the Sanjauli mosque committee on Monday started demolition of the three illegal storeys of the mosque in Shimla. The court of Shimla municipal commissioner, Bhupender Kumar Attri, had on Oct 5 ordered the Muslim Welfare Committee to raze the top three storeys within two months at its own expense.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114441949,imgsize-1674247,width-400,resizemode-4/114441949.jpg"
Canadian govt had whiff of 1985 Air India bombing plot that killed 329: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canadian-govt-had-whiff-of-1985-air-india-bombing-plot-that-killed-329-report/articleshow/114429608.cms,"File photo

What happened in 1985

A report published by the state-funded Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) claiming that Canada's security agency ""had a mole"" in the group that hatched the plan to bomb an Air India flight in 1985 is going viral on social media.The report published in 2003 claims that the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) ""pulled out the mole at the last minute so he wouldn't be implicated"".This fresh outpour of anger on social media over the 21-year-old report comes at a time when India-Canada bilateral relations have descended to its lowest.The strained relations between Ottawa and New Delhi went several notches lower after Canadian PM Justin Trudeau levelled unsubstantiated charges against Indian envoys, linking them to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was also a Canadian citizen.The CBC, based on the document released by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) back then, had reported that Canada's CSIS set up a mole named Surjan Singh Gill who described himself as the consul-general of Khalistan The report mentions that Gill was ""involved right from the start and was directed by 'certain people' to stay involved and learn what was going on"".Later, the Canadian authority asked Gill to ""back out"" as he couldn't be seen to be a part of it.""They told him to get out of there. That things are happening and you can't be seen as part of that,"" Sgt. Jim Hunter told CBC.The Canadian state media's documents are based on transcripts of an interview conducted by the RCMP with Ajaib Singh Bagri, one of the accused in Air India bombings. Bagri was arrested in October 2000.Gill eventually left Canada to live in London. He was never charged in the bombing of Air India Flight 182, which took place in 1985, killing 329 people off the coast of Ireland, the CBC report claims.In the same report, it has been claimed that the CSIS destroyed ""hundreds of wiretaps relating to the Air India investigation"".This year in June, contradictory to the CBC report, Canadian law enforcement issued a statement assuring that the probe into the bombing of Air India flight 182, the Kanishka, by Khalistani terrorists, remains active and ongoing.The statement came as the tragedy marked its 39th memorial anniversary.On June 23, 1985, an Air India flight travelling from Canada to India via London exploded off the Irish coast, resulting in the deaths of all 329 passengers and crew on board.The explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in a suitcase that had been transferred onto the flight despite the ticket holder not boarding. Among the victims were 268 Canadian citizens, predominantly of Indian descent, and 24 Indian nationals. Only 131 bodies were recovered from the sea.","Report published in 2003 claims that the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) ""pulled out the mole at the last minute so he wouldn't be implicated"" This fresh outpour of anger on social media over the report comes at a time when India-Canada bilateral relations have descended to its lowest.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114431486,imgsize-296210,width-400,resizemode-4/114431486.jpg"

Jaishankar on Monday criticised certain western nations for struggling to adapt to the emerging multi-polar world order, where the Global South is gaining influence.Speaking at an NDTV summit, the minister specifically condemned Canada's "" double standards "" regarding the expectations placed on Indian diplomats in Canada compared to what Canadian diplomats can do on Indian soil.""Canada asked us to subject our High Commissioner to a police inquiry and we chose to withdraw the High Commissioner and diplomats. They seem to have a problem if Indian diplomats are even trying to make efforts to find out what is happening in Canada on matters which directly pertain to their welfare and security. But look what happens in India. Canadian diplomats have no problem going around collecting information on our military, police, profiling people, targeting people to be stopped in Canada. So apparently, the license that they give themselves is totally different from the kind of restrictions that they impose on diplomats in Canada,"" Jaishankar said, adding that the word ""double-standard is too mild"".""When we tell them you have people openly threatening leaders of India, diplomats of India. Their answer is freedom of speech. When Indian journalists make social media comments, if you threaten the Indian High Commissioner, he is supposed to accept it as freedom of speech. But if an Indian journalist says the Canadian High Commissioner walked out of South Block looking very grumpy, it is apparently foreign interference. There is this thing that we will do it differently at home. We will do it differently abroad. We will do it our way, but that doesn't apply to you. I think these are the larger adjustments which have to happen in this changing world,"" the EAM said.The reaction comes as Justin Trudeau 's government grapples with accusations of failing to provide substantial evidence that India was connected to the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.In response to Trudeau's allegations, India has categorically denied any involvement in Nijjar's killing, labeling the claims as ""absurd"" and politically motivated.India also recently expelled 6 Canadian diplomats from New Delhi while recalling its High Commissioner and some diplomats from Ottawa.The external affairs ministry criticised Trudeau for his ""cavalier behavior"", which they said has damaged bilateral relations. The ministry also accused Canada of harboring extremist elements that threaten India's national security.","India's external affairs minister Dr. S.

Supreme Court rejects plea to replace word 'Hindutva' with 'Samvidhanatva',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-rejects-plea-to-replace-word-hindutva-with-samvidhanatva/articleshow/114438706.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday trashed a fresh attempt to equate ' Hindutva ' with fundamentalism by outrightly rejecting a PIL by a 65-year-old doctor seeking to get the term, which he claimed was inimical to secular fabric , replaced with 'Bhartiya Samvidhanatva '.This was the third challenge in SC to ""Hindutva"" since 1994 when the apex court, in Ismail Faruqi judgment, said, ""Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or state of mind and it is not to be equated with, or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism.""On Monday, Dr S N Kundra came up with a different argument: ""The word 'Hinduism' leaves a lot of scope for its misuse by religious fundamentalists of a particular religion, and by those bent upon changing our secular Constitution to a theocratic Constitution (Manusmriti).Thus, inadvertently, SC's observations (that Hinduism is a way of life) are putting our Constitution at peril.""A bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud would have none of this and said, ""we will not entertain such petitions"". It even refused permission to the petitioner to place his case, saying the court has better work to do.Kundra had argued, ""Continuous efforts are made by religious fundamentalists of a particular religion, under garb of Hindutva to promote homogenised majority and cultural hegemony in India. Attempts are also made to make Hindutva a mark of nationalism and citizenship.""The petitioner who did not back up the charge with evidence, further said: ""The secular fabric of the nation is being greatly damaged by misusing the term 'Hindutva'. All activities blatantly promoting/propagating a particular religion, are carried out by those holding top constitutional posts using the term 'Hindutva' to throw sand in the eyes of people/media/legal observers"".SC in its Dec 1995 judgment in Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo case, had ruled that ""no precise meaning can be ascribed to the terms 'Hindu', 'Hindutva' and 'Hinduism'; and no meaning in the abstract can confine it to the narrow limits of religion alone, excluding the content of Indian culture and heritage. It is also indicated that the term 'Hindutva' or 'Hinduism' per se, in abstract, can be assumed to mean and be equated with narrow fundamentalist Hindu religious bigotry..."" The court had said the terms 'Hindutva' or 'Hinduism' per se cannot be construed to depict hostility, enmity or intolerance towards other religious faiths or professing communalism.In 2016, a 7-judge bench of SC refused to reconsider the 1995 judgment that defined 'Hinduism' as a way of life, rejecting a plea by social worker Teesta Setalvad for redefining the word 'Hindutva' and banning its use in elections.","Supreme Court rejects a PIL by a 65-year-old doctor seeking to get the term 'Hindutva' replaced with 'Bhartiya Samvidhanatva' Dr S N Kundra claimed the term was inimical to secular fabric.

RANCHI: RJD is likely to settle for eight seats in the Jharkhand elections , party insiders said, though RJD reportedly held on to its initial demand of over a dozen seats at a meeting between Jharkhand CM and JMM working president Hemant Soren and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday. A senior RJD functionary said on condition of anonymity, ""JMM has offered us seven seats. We have asked for nine seats and we are hopeful that we will settle at eight.""Soren and Tejashwi met twice on Monday over seat-sharing to iron out differences.CPI-ML, also an INDIA bloc constituent, demanded at least five seats. Other Left parties, CPI and CPM, said they would fight independently after they were not invited to the talks.Tejashwi met Soren at the latter's residence along with CPI-ML leaders on Monday morning. Later in the evening, Tejashwi had a one-on-one meeting with Soren. The former Bihar deputy CM has met Hemant five times over the past four days beginning Friday. RJD has termed the JMM and Congress' decision to fight on 70 out of 81 seats and leave 11 for the rest of the bloc parties as ""unfair"" and has threatened to go solo in at least 19 seats.JMM spokesperson Vinod Kumar Pandey said, ""We are equally eager for a closure and declare our candidates at the earliest."" However, no announcement was made till late on Monday evening.Meanwhile, sources in the Congress said the party is likely to announce its candidates on Tuesday. On Monday evening, AICC convened its parliamentary board meeting to finalise names.The Jharkhand unit of Congress has virtually shifted to Delhi as several ticket claimants as well as state party office bearers have been camping in the national capital since the last couple of days amid lack of clarity over seat-sharing with alliance partners and delay in declaration of candidate list.","RJD is likely to settle for eight seats in the Jharkhand elections, party insiders said.

""Nothing can be worse for a news organisation than being labelled a puppet of an intelligence agency, a stooge of the govt,"" the HC remarked, saying if left ""unrebutted, the credibility goes.""Even as Wikipedia's counsel tried to defend its refusal to disclose information on grounds that they would be targeted once the names are revealed, the court pointed out that the suit filed by the news agency cannot go ahead unless a disclosure is made so that it can serve them notices.

MUMBAI: The still-unresolved row between Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) in the Maha Vikas Aghadi is over 15 assembly seats, three of them in Mumbai and 12 in eastern Vidarbha. As both parties are claiming these seats, NCP (SP) president Sharad Pawar, UBT Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala are set to meet on Tuesday to try and find a solution.More than a dozen meetings have been held by the MVA over seat-sharing but there is no end to the stalemate over these 15 seats, sources said.The three seats in Mumbai claimed by both Congress and UBT Sena are Byculla, Bandra East and Versova. Among the ones in Vidarbha are Ramtek, Gondia, South Nagpur, Bhandara and Gadchiroli.MPCC president Nana Patole said discussion on 96 seats allotted to Congress is complete, and Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray will meet on Tuesday for further discussions on the seat-sharing formula.According to the understanding among MVA partners, NCP (SP) is likely to contest 80 seats, while UBT Shiv Sena will contest nearly 90 and the remaining - the highest number - will be allotted to the Congress.Despite the sharp exchange of words between Patole and UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut last week over the seats under dispute, the MPCC president on Monday claimed there are no disagreements within MVA over seat allocation.Patole said there is absolutely no substance in some reports which have said that UBT Sena is all set to quit MVA. He alleged BJP was deliberately spreading such ""rumours and misinformation"" about the opposition parties. ""The MVA is intact, there is no truth in such reports.

CHENNAI: After Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu urged families to have more children, his Tamil Nadu counterpart, M K Stalin , toed a similar line, though not so stridently.Speaking at an event organised by Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) department in Chennai on Monday, Stalin questioned the need to restrict families to fewer children since states which effectively implement population control measures are penalised After Naidu, now Stalin bats for more children with fewer Lok Sabha constituencies.“People in olden days used to wish thus: ‘Pathinarum petru peru vazhvu vazhga (Beget sixteen gifts to live a full life).’ Today people wish to have fewer children and live happily,” said Stalin.“In the scenario of a reduction in Lok Sabha constituencies, however, a question arises on the need to restrict ourselves to few children. A situation has risen where we have to say let us also have 16 children,” Stalin said.The statement comes days after Chandrababu Naidu announced that Andhra Pradesh’s government is planning to incentivise families having more children due to the ageing population. He has urged people of south Indian states to have more children.The total fertility rate (TFR), or the number of children born to women between 15 and 49 years of age in Tamil Nadu, is 1.4, one of the lowest in the country, along with Delhi and West Bengal. Tamil Nadu’s population, which was 7.33 crore in 2013, is estimated to be 7.71 crore in 2024. It is expected to peak in 2031 at 7.8 crore and begin to decline thereafter.CMs of two prominent southern states calling for families to have more children come in the wake of reports that the BJP-led Union government is planning to realign constituencies based on population, which, if implemented, would give a decisive political advantage to north Indian states, which have larger populations, as they would get more Lok Sabha seats compared to southern states.","Stalin questioned the need to restrict families to fewer children.

MUMBAI: In the 99 seats for which BJP announced candidates on Sunday, the party took 5 seats that were contested by the undivided Shiv Sena in 2019. Political observers said this indicates that the CM Eknath Shinde-led Sena may have to compromise on seats and give up several of the seats that the Sena traditionally contested. The Nalasopara , Uran , Dhule city, Achalpur and Deoli seats were contested by Sena in 2019, but BJP has announced candidates there.In Dhule city, BJP announced the candidature of Anup Agarwal. In 2019, the Sena's Hilal Mali contested the seat but came fourth in the contest; the AIMIM's Shah Faruk Anwar won the seat. In Deoli, the Sena's Sameer Deshmukh contested but came third. BJP announced the name of Rajesh Banke from this seat. In 2019, Banke had contested as an independent and come second. In Achalpur, the Sena's Sunita Phiske contested, but she came third; Prahar Party's Bachchu Kadu won this seat. BJP has now named Pravin Tayade from this seat.In Nalasopara, in 2019, former cop Pradeep Sharma contested from Shiv Sena; he lost to the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi's (BVA) Kshitij Thakur. BJP has named Rajan Naik from this seat. From Uran, independent candidate Manohar Baldi defeated Sena's Manohar Bhoir. Baldi then extended support to BJP, and BJP has now named him as its official candidate.Even though BJP released a list of 99 seats, the Shinde Sena presented a case for getting around 100-105 seats before Union home minister Amit Shah. Eventually, Sena may get around 80-90 seats, and NCP led by Ajit Pawar may get 50-60 seats. While BJP is not too keen on giving a big chunk to NCP, political observers said NCP will not agree to anything fewer than 50-60 seats.Political observers said that in Mahayuti, a tussle is expected as the demands made by allies are more than what BJP can actually concede.","In 99 seats for which BJP announced candidates on Sunday, the party took 5 seats that were contested by the undivided Shiv Sena in 2019.
