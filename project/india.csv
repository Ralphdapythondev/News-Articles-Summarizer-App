Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country. All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

After South Africa ended Afghanistan's fairytale run in the T20 World Cup with a nine-wicket hammering in the semifinal at Trinidad, all eyes are on the skies in Guyana where rain threatens to play spoilsport in the second semi-final between India and defending champions England.While the temperature is expected to remain in the early thirties through the day, it's the possibility of rain and thunderstorms that remains a cause of worry, especially since there is no reserve day allocated to the second semifinal.However, according to the tournament rules in case of a washout or no-result in the semifinals, India's top-place finish in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage will take them through to the final against South Africa if rain and bad weather doesn't allow the game at the Providence Stadium to be completed.The 250 extra minutes allocated by the ICC to finish the second semifinal will give the match officials almost eight hours to constitute a game that provides a result and a winner. The scheduled start time is 10:30 am, which is 8 pm in India.The weather currently in Guyana, as shown in the below screenshot from accuweather.com, is ""partly cloudy"".However, the June 27 forecast reads ""intervals of clouds and sunshine with a couple of showers, mainly early in the day"".With extended hours of play possible in case of rain interruptions, the game may well go deep into the evening in Guyana, bringing the afternoon and evening weather into play.Here's how the Guyana weather forecast for June 27 looks like:",India face England in the second semi-final of the T20 World Cup in Guyana.

The AAP MPs, holding placards with slogans such as ""Stop misusing ED and CBI"" and ""Dictatorship will not work"", announced their decision to boycott the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, marking this as the first presidential address following the formation of the third National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.AAP leader Sandeep Pathak emphasized the significance of protesting against what they deem to be dictatorial actions under the guise of justice.He stated, ""The President and the Constitution are supreme and when dictatorship is done in the name of justice, it is important to raise voices."" He added that the party would express their dissent in the Rajya Sabha .""Today we will protest in the Rajya Sabha against the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and we will boycott the President's address. The President and the Constitution are supreme and when dictatorship is done in the name of justice, it is important to raise our voices,"" Pathak highlighted.Pathak clarified that the decision to protest was taken independently by AAP without coordinating with other parties in the INDIA alliance. ""We did not have a discussion with the remaining parties of the INDIA alliance regarding this but our party will boycott the President's address,"" he said.The Rouse Avenue Court of Delhi on Wednesday ordered Kejriwal to three days of CBI remand related to the Excise policy case .

Additionally, Kejriwal can carry his prescribed medicines throughout the remand period.During the court hearing, Kejriwal defended himself, arguing that the accusations against him were fabricated and intended to tarnish his reputation and that of his party. He said, ""CBI is claiming that I have made a statement against Manish Sisodia, which is completely false. Manish Sisodia Nirdosh hai, Aam Aadmi Party Nirdosh hai. Main bhi nirdosh hun. Iss Tarah ke statements hamme media me badnam Karne ke liye diye ja rahe hai.""He further emphasized the perceived media manipulation. ""CBI sources ke hawale se media me hamme badnam kar rahe rahe hai.

The High Court stated that the trial court should have recorded its satisfaction regarding the fulfillment of the twin conditions of Section 45 of the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act (PMLA) before deciding.The motion of thanks following the President's address will be moved in both Houses of Parliament and discussed by the members.

Indian bowler ne cheating ki | inzamam ul haq latest on India vs Australia T20 world cup match

NEW DELHI: Responding sharply to former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq 's accusations of ball tampering by Team India during the Super 8 match against Australia, skipper Rohit Sharma emphasised that if it won’t reverse swing here, then where it will, as the Men in Blue are not playing in conditions like those in Australia or England.Rohit's remarks followed Inzamam's assertion that it's unlikely for the ball to reverse swing as early as in the 15th over of the game, hinting at suspicions that ""serious work had been done"" on the ball."" Arshdeep Singh , when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam had said on Pakistani news channel.Addressing the media, ahead of India's semifinal clash against England, to be played on Thursday, Rohit said: ""What can I say. Don’t you see the rough surfaces and the heat here? This isn’t Australia or England. Here the conditions will result in the ball reverse swinging in 12-15 overs. It’s happening for all teams and not us alone. Sometime people need to open their mind and think"".Not only Inzamam, but former player Saleem Malik also suggested that officials often overlook issues when it comes to India.""Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained I was fined quite heavily,"" added Saleem Malik.India's 26-run victory over Australia played a crucial role in eliminating the Australian side from the Super 8 stage of the tournament.After avenging their 2023 ODI World Cup defeat against Australia with an impressive victory, India now aim for redemption against England as they meet in the rain-threatened T20 World Cup semi-finals at Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.",Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq accused Team India of ball tampering.

GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows.

Saving water for drinking

DEFICIT RAIN IN MOST DISTRICTS

BENGALURU: With the monsoon slowing considerably over Karnataka in the past week, tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu appears set to escalate over sharing of Cauvery river water. A hint of this emerged at a Cauvery Water Management Authority ( CWMA ) meeting late on Tuesday, with both the states sticking to their stands on the issue.At the meeting, Karnataka, the upper riparian state, citing low inflow into the four reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin, expressed its inability to release water to its neighbour as per the month-wise schedule prescribed by Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal.Karnataka said its reser-voirs cumulatively received a measly 7.3Tmcft of water from June 1 to June 24 against a 30-year average of about 24.4Tmcft in the same period. Karnataka also said it would consider releasing water depending on how the monsoon behaves and inflows into its reservoirs.Tamil Nadu vehemently objected, while demanding the authority direct Karnataka to release water as per the schedule. But Karnata-ka also suggested Tamil Nadu was wasting water.In a submission before CWMA, Karnataka said: “Despite prevailing 70% distress conditions at four reservoirs of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu has been making large releases into the river from its reservoirs amounting to 3.9Tmcft to date. Karnataka has not released water into its canals [for irrigation] toconserve water for drinking purposes. The authority is requested to watch the evolving situation up to the end of July. By taking stock of the hydrological scenario, a considered decision could be taken (sic).”Since levels were low in its reservoirs, Karnataka released 5.3Tmcft less than the prescribed quantity to Tamil Nadu till June 24. CWMA has also previously directed Karnataka to release 31.2Tmcft for the month of July. At the meeting, Tamil Nadu demanded that Karnataka make up for the deficit in June, besidesmeeting the July quota.Though the authority decided to wait till July 27 to review the hydrological situation before taking a call, it is highly likely that both the states will be at loggerheads if the monsoon does not pick up in the next one week. In some relief, rain fell in catchment areas on Wednesday, bringing some relief.Last year, when Karnataka witnessed one of the worst droughts in more than 100 years, tension prevailed between the two states for almost four months from Nov to Feb.Barring Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Tumakuru districts, all other districts in the state have recorded deficit rainfall over the past seven days.The situation is far grimmer in North Karnataka compared to other regions asaverage deficit over normal rainfall in these districts is as high as 47%. The deficit has touched over 60% in districts like Raichur, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Ballari and Vijayapura. Even Malnad districts of Shivamogga, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu have received below normal rainfall.","Karnataka said its reser-voirs received a measly 7.3Tmcft of water from June 1 to June 24.

As Tharoor walked off after shaking hands with Birla, the Speaker said, ""He is already taking oath on the Constitution.""Soon after this remark, a few members of the opposition started to contradict him while Deepender Hooda stood up from his seat to say the Speaker should not be objecting to this.""Don't give me advice on what I should or should not object to.

What has changed for Congress to reinstate Pitroda?

Why is Sam Pitroda important for Congress?

'PM Modi had already predicted Pitroda's reinstatement'

Pitroda's past controversies

On Ram Mandir

On 1984 anti-Sikh riots

On Pulwama attack

Nehru vs Ambedkar on Constitution

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda , who has a penchant for stoking controversies, is back as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress , less than two months after he quit the post in the middle of Lok Sabha elections with ""mutual consent"" over remarks that were ""totally unacceptable to the Congress.""""Congress president has reappointed Sam Pitroda as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress with immediate effect,"" AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said in a statement on Wednesday.Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda was reappointed Indian Overseas Congress chief after he clarified the context in which the controversial statements were made.Well, it was a remark that had the potential to harm the grand old party's electoral prospects. Pitroda during a podcast cited ethnic and racial identities like Chinese, Africans, Arabs and Whites to describe the physical appearance of Indians from different parts of the country.In the podcast, Pitroda had said, ""We have survived 75 years in a very happy environment where people could live together, leaving aside a few fights here and there.""""We could hold a country as diverse as India together. Where people in the east look like the Chinese, people in the west look like the Arabs, people in the north look like, maybe, white and people in the south look like Africans.""It does not matter. All of us are brothers and sisters. We respect different languages, different religions, different customs, different food,"" he had said.The BJP was quick to make this a poll issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP's attack on Pitroda's analogy and slammed his comments as ""racist"". He asserted that people will not tolerate the attempt to insult them on the basis of their skin colour.At his rallies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Modi had said he is livid with the racial profiling of Indians by the US-based ""philosopher and uncle of 'Shehzada'"", and linked the Congress' opposition to Droupadi Murmu's presidential bid to its mindset, which saw her as an ""African"" because of her dark skin.With PM Modi 's focus on south outreach, the Congress was quick to distance itself from Pitroda's remarks and called it ""completely unacceptable.""Unfortunately for the Congress , this was not the first but the second controversy stoked by Pitroda.His remarks on the concept of inheritance tax in the United States while discussing the Congress' Lok Sabha poll manifesto gave the ruling BJP a potent handle to accuse the opposition party of eying citizens' assets as part of its ""redistribution of wealth"" policy.This came at a time when the Congress was trying hard to counter Prime Minister Modi's relentless attack over its manifesto pitch on socio-economic and caste survey and redistribution of resources.PM Modi attacked Congress with a popular tag line of LIC and said ""zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi"" is the opposition party's mantra to ""loot"" people. In his poll rallies, PM Modi used Pitroda's comments to assert that it has exposed Congress's hidden agenda and that the party has become so removed from the country's social and family values that it wants to legally rob people of their assets and lifelong savings they want to bequeath to their children.The Congress was again quick to clarify that Pitroda's views were not the official views of the party.Well, nothing except that elections are now over so perhaps there is no fear of electoral damage to the Congress in the near future. The party has blamed the BJP for distorting Pitroda's statement to reap electoral gains.Pitroda has given an assurance not to leave room for such controversies in future. ""He has clarified the context in which statements were made and how they were later distorted by the Modi campaign. The Congress president has reappointed him on the assurance that he will not in future leave room for such controversies to arise,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.The veteran leader was an advisor to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He has been closely associated with Rahul Gandhi, accompanying him during his foreign visits. Pitroda has also arranged several interactions of Rahul with students of foreign universities in the UK, the UAE and the US.The BJP reacted sharply to Congress move and said that the grand old party kept a distance from Sam Pitroda during the Lok Sabha elections just to deceive the public.""The first thing Rahul Gandhi did as soon as he became the leader of the opposition was to become the leader of hypocrisy and leader of opportunism...One thing is clear from this that the cosmetic distance that the Congress party had made from Sam Pitroda during the elections was only and only a pretence, it was a lie, and it was to deceive the public,"" said BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju took a jibe at the Congress and said Prime Minister Modi Ji had already predicted this development.Sharing a post on X, the Union Minister wrote, ""Prime Minister Modi ji has already said! Rahul Gandhi Ji's adviser who said, South Indians look like Africans, North-Eastern people look Chinese, West Indians are like Arabs & North Indian are whites is reinstated. We are not surprised as PM @narendramodi ji had predicted.""Along with the text, the Union Minister also shared an old video of Prime Minister Modi in which he said that Sam Pitroda doesn't give controversial statements by chance, rather, it's the Congress party's strategy to create new issues in the country.The PM had then said, ""I don't think he does it by his choice, as after his controversial statements, he is suspended from the party, and after some days, he is again seen in the mainstream works of the party. It's a well-known strategy of the Congress party to create confusion, change the environment, and add new issues to the nation. So, they play some tactics from time to time.""In June 2023, Pitroda gave the BJP ammunition to attack the Congress as he said that temples were not going to solve India’s problems of unemployment, inflation, education, and health. ""No one talks about these things. But everyone talks about Ram, Hanuman, and Mandir. I have said that temples are not going to create jobs,"" he had said then.In May 2019, Pitroda had said ""hua to hua"" (so what) when he was asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. ’84 mein hua to hua. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. Aapne wo bhi nahi kiya. Aapne kuch nahi kiya isliye aap yahan wahan gup lagate hain',"" Pitroda had then said.In February 2019, Pitroda kicked up a storm as he raised questions on Balakot air strikes by the Indian Air Force which were carried out in retaliation to the Pulwama attacks. ""I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. The attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.Pitroda had in April 2019 cited an article by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide of BJP veteran LK Advani, and claimed that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, contributed more than BR Ambedkar in the framing of the Constitution. Pitroda later deleted the post.Pitroda is now back with the Congress. Will he be more careful with his remarks as he has promised or will he embarrass the grand old party again? Well, we will have to wait for the next round of elections due later this year.(With inputs from agencies)","Sam Pitroda is back as chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.

EOW said even after further investigations were conducted, it was found that no cognizable offence had been committed. Hence, the closure report was submitted.The development comes days after an article in the RSS organ 'Organiser' attributed BJP's poor performance in LS polls in state to its alliance with Ajit Pawar, and amid reports of state BJP and Shiv Sena functionaries urging their netas to 'remove NCP from the Mahayuti'.The Rs 25,000 crore MSCB scam case highlights the alleged irregularities in auctioning of sick sugar mills by MSCB, which was reportedly controlled by senior politicians who allegedly benefited from auctioning of these mills to their kin. ED had alleged cheating, misconduct, and money laundering in the auctioning of the four sick mills and linked the suspicious transactions with Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra Pawar, Shiv Sena's Arjun Khotkar, and companies of NCP (SP) leaders Rohit Pawar and Prajakt Tanpure.ED informed the court that it had shared its findings with EOW and stated that it is an affected party as their money laundering case is based on EOW's FIR in the scam that was registered on Bombay HC's directions. In response, EOW submitted its reply in the court recently stating that the court had earlier rejected the ED's similar intervention application.","Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police objected to Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s claim that Maharashtra State Co-Operative Bank (MSCB) office bearers committed cheating.

Besides, Murmu pointed to the recently notified law against those undertaking unfair means or those offering assistance.The address also gave a strong vote of confidence for EVMs, on which the opposition repeatedly raised doubts during the poll campaign.

What is your locus standi: SC to coaching centre on NEET plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-your-locus-standi-sc-to-coaching-centre-on-neet-plea/articleshow/111323483.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pressure to advertise their strike rates in competitive examinations to increase enrolment for private tutorials made a coaching centre approach Supreme Court on Wednesday, alleging that National Testing Agency (NTA) has not provided for a mechanism to redress grievances of candidates regarding evaluation of OMR sheets in NEET-UG examination.A vacation bench of Justices Manoj Misra and S V N Bhatti wondered as to which fundamental right of the coaching centre was violated to entitle it file a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. ""You are a coaching institute. How can you file a petition under Article 32,"" it asked senior advocate R Basant.When Basant said even if the court disregards the coaching centre, there are four other students who have filed a joint petition alleging that OMR answer sheets have discrepancies in evaluation and that there is no mechanism provided by the NTA to address these grievances.NTA counsel Vardhaman Kaushik said a batch of petitions related to alleged irregularities in NEET-UG is engaging the attention of SC and is fixed for hearing on July 8, the first day of the court resuming normal business after summer break.But court, on insistence of Basant, asked NTA to file an affidavit detailing the mechanism to address grievances of students regarding evaluation of OMR sheets. However, it expressed its strong disapproval of the coaching centres jumping into the fray with students regarding the NEET-UG.The bench observed, ""We see the role played by the coaching centres as pied pipers. They have hardly any role to play in this case. Your duties end once coaching is over. If they have discharged the duty of coaching, that is the end of the matter. They have not further undertaken to see that they will have a role to play after the coaching is over.""Repudiating the claim of the coaching centre that OMR sheets are not provided to every candidate who took NEET-UG, NTA counsel told SC that they have been uploaded on the website.The apex court asked NTA to file a detailed affidavit on this issue and tagged the petition with the bunch of matters to be taken up for hearing on July 8.","A vacation bench of Justices Manoj Misra and S V N Bhatti wondered as to which fundamental right of the coaching centre was violated.

"A temple for Mahabharat's arch villain, now a taxpayer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

"Budget 2024 will roll out historic steps, speed up reforms: President Murmu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/budget-2024-will-roll-out-historic-steps-speed-up-reforms-president-murmu/articleshow/111324734.cms,"President address hints reduced tally may not inhibit BJP

NEW DELHI: Raising expectations of major announcements, President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday said the first Budget of PM Narendra Modi 's third term will have several historic steps, going beyond economic and social decisions. ""This Budget will be an effective document of govt's far-reaching policies and futuristic vision... The pace of reforms will be further accelerated in tune with the aspirations of people of India for rapid development,"" the President said in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament .Expectations of a reform-oriented Budget have been building up since Modi returned to office for a third consecutive term, equalling Nehru's record, with govt expected to address several concerns flagged during the elections, including job creation and inflation through a push for manufacturing, tax concessions to spur demand and provide more money to households.The PM has also spoken about the Budget being a key element of the govt's 2047 development agenda which will include a 100-day programme leading to action points and targets up to 2030.Curiosity about the Budget has been heightened by the estimate in political quarters that govt might come up with measures which may help alleviate the grudges behind BJP's lower-than-expected seats tally. In any case, despite being in a good fiscal spot, govt had held off on coming out with schemes for specific sections in the interim budget. It is expected to make good for the restraint in the coming Budget, besides having reachouts to sections like women.Murmu's address was marked by confidence and an effort to amplify the message that BJP's reduced numbers will not be a deterrent in its pursuit of bold measures.The Prez cited the favourable environment for India and underlined the need for lawmakers to fulfil their responsibilities so that the country can harness its potential. She listed out the achievements of the Modi govt during its first two terms - from an average 8% GDP growth during the last three years to India emerging as the fifth largest economy and record profits by State Bank of India - despite challenges posed by Covid and geopolitical tension in Ukraine and West Asia.""With the reforms that have taken place in the last 10 years and the new confidence that has been infused in the country, we have gained a new momentum to make India a developed nation. We all need to always remember that making India a developed nation is the aspiration and resolve of every citizen of the country. All of us are responsible for ensuring that no obstacles come in the way of achieving this resolution,"" the Prez said at a time when BJP, while leading a coalition govt after 10 years, will need numbers in Parliament to ensure passage of key bills.Govt has lined up several legislations, from amendments to the Constitution for one nation-one election to strengthening the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and decriminalising several laws.Murmu also reflected govt's grouse over what it considers baseless propaganda by the opposition, especially Congress, that the Modi govt has undermined the public sector and that GST, dubbed ""Gabbar Singh Tax"" by the party, was an extortionist device.""Many such reforms have taken place in the last 10 years which are greatly benefiting the nation today. Even when these reforms were being taken up, they were opposed and attempts were made to spread negativity. But all these reforms have stood the test of time,"" she said while listing out the clean-up of banks, revitalising Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and GST.She also argued for healthy competition between states to attract investment and said the Centre would seek to push ahead with their development.","Expectations of a reform-oriented Budget have been building up since Modi returned to office for a third consecutive term, equalling Nehru's record.

BJP is the new 'Congress' for Akali Dal in Punjab politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-is-the-new-congress-for-akali-dal-in-punjab-politics/articleshow/111302557.cms,"JALANDHAR: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) appears to have become the new Congress for Akali politics in Punjab. Though Akali Dal and Congress were main adversaries in Punjab after Partition, following the tumultuous events of 1984 there was a very strong sentiment against Congress and it was often called the enemy of Sikhs. The labels of 'Congress agent' or 'B team of Congress' were used by the competitors within Sikh political space against each other.Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was the most deft and frequent user of these labels and any dissenter in Shiromani Akali Dal was labelled 'B team of Congress'.His camp used this label even for the late Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gurcharan Singh Tohra and his associates when they sparred with Badal Senior. IPS officer-turned-Akali politician Simranjit Singh Mann was attacked with the same label by Badal Senior's camp and this label was even used for those in the radical camp at different times, sometimes subtly and at others openly.After Congress was badly thrashed and thrown out of power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Badals started missing the 'enemy' at the Centre. The concept of Congress as 'enemy' was vital to their politics and rhetoric and it also helped them to provide cover to their deviations from the earlier stated positions and policies of the Akali Dal on a few crucial issues. Though the Badals shared power at the Centre for over six years as part of NDA till the farm movement forced them to sever ties with BJP, Congress as the 'main enemy of Panth and Punjab' remained central to their political rhetoric.Even after ending 25-year-old alliance with BJP in 2020, the Badals and other Akali leaders, barring a few occasions including in their speeches in Parliament, did not attack or criticise BJP much as the possibility of coming together again had not been ruled out yet. Opening of channels before the 2024 elections between SAD and BJP was confirmed by Union home minister Amit Shah himself but after SAD laid conditions for the alliance and BJP announced its decision to contest elections on its own in Punjab by turning to aggressive campaigning, both sides hardened their positions.After that, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal repeatedly started mentioning how RSS had taken control of gurdwara bodies outside Punjab. He also time and again attacked communal politics being played in the country, referring to BJP by implication.That the larger Sikh community remains apprehensive about BJP is clear from the voting pattern in Punjab for the Lok Sabha elections as the community strategically voted to block the saffron party and Congress became its biggest beneficiary in the state.Sukhbir's allegations that BJP was sponsoring his detractors within the Sikh political space seem to resonate given the examples of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee and Haryana State Gurdwara Management Committee. DSGMC remains the biggest example of Sukhbir's loyalist SAD leaders shifting loyalty to the BJP.The BJP has now replaced Congress in the labels such as ""agents"" and ""B team"" used by the Badal camp as they know well that, true or false, projecting this perception will help them counter their detractors amongst the Sikh community.The irony remains that they are deftly using these after extending unconditional support to BJP for close to 25 years even if that meant complete reversal of Akali Dal's stated positions or policies on a few issues. The long alliance also helped the saffron party to expand its base in Punjab.","After Partition, there was a very strong sentiment against Congress and it was often called the enemy of Sikhs.

Google Trends: This topic has fetched wide interest globally

NEW DELHI: Christina Applegate 's teenage daughter recently revealed that she was diagnosed with POTS .In an episode of the ""MeSsy"" podcast hosted by Jamie Lynn-Sigler , Sadie Grace Applegate LeNoble , daughter of the ""Dead to Me"" star, said that she has been dealing with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) for several years. She mentioned on the Tuesday episode that despite experiencing symptoms for a long time, she was only officially diagnosed with POTS in the past few months.“I have no clue what it actually is, but it’s something to do with the autonomic nervous system and it affects my heart,” Sadie explained.“So when I stand up, I get really, really dizzy and my legs get really weak and I feel like I’m going to pass out.”POTS, which started ranking on Google Trends, impacts the autonomic nervous system, crucial for regulating essential bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, pupil size, and blood flow. It results in an accelerated heart rate when transitioning from sitting or lying down to standing up. POTS is an incurable condition, affects between 1 million to 3 million people in the United StatesOn the podcast, Sadie shared that her experience with POTS includes symptoms like tremors and blurry vision, affecting her school days. She described feeling sick and in pain during classes, noting that some teachers have not taken her concerns seriously and have refused her requests to see the nurse.“Them not doing anything about it definitely hurt me physically and emotionally,” she said. “This is rude and I feel sick and you’re telling me to go to PE and run laps around the football field. I can’t do that.”School staffers aren't the only ones who overlooked Sadie's condition. Applegate, 52, admitted she was unaware of what her daughter was going through. ""I feel so horrible that we didn’t pay attention to it,"" she said. Applegate apologized to her daughter and connected her own battle with MS to Sadie’s experiences.“We get out in the world, and the stresses and the anxiety of the world bring upon our symptoms much worse than they would be if we were in the safety and the coolness of our own homes,” she said.Sadie, who is still working out treatment and medication with her doctor, said her experience with POTS helps her empathize with her mom. Applegate was diagnosed with MS three years ago and has been open about her struggles with the autoimmune disease. Earlier this month, the Emmy-winning star detailed the return of her depression.Applegate, diagnosed with MS three years ago, has openly shared her challenges with the autoimmune condition.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

One such is that the girl is a pre-school teacher and was fired from her job after the video went viral. As social media started believing in the claim which also had a purported statement from the school how her act would impact the students etc, it turned out to be a hoax.The fake claim was made in good humor by one satire page on Meta. They also put a hilarious name to the school 'Epstein day school'.""We have kid spitting on each other and everything else since they heard their beloved Miss Hailey say ""spit on that thang"" on YouTube,"" the satire piece said.So no, the 'hawk tuah' girl was not actually fired from her job but somebody else was for using that meme. According to reports, JD Motorsports, the NASCAR Xfinity Series team, fired its social media manager for using the 'hawk tuah' meme which was immediately taken down. Dorman (@RDorman19) claimed in a post that he was removed from JD socials and had to delete the meme.After remaining in shadows, now the identity of the viral 'hawk tuah' girl is established. She is Hailey Welch, a resident of Nashville who went viral after she enacted a spitting act 'on that thing' when she was asked about the move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time.""Oh you have got to give it that 'hawk tuah' and spit on that thang, you get me?"" she vivaciously replied and then there was no looking back as now there are merchandises, theories.Yes theories on why people, irrespective of the gender, are liking the spitting act.

Their story of love and companionship spans over four decades, starting with an unforgettable first meeting.Reflecting on her first encounter with the former Indian cricket team captain, Sharmila during her appearance on ‘Kon Banega Crorepati 15’ revealed that their paths crossed at a cricket party in Kolkata. She was an ardent cricket enthusiast and admirer of cricketers, which set the stage for their initial meeting. “At a cricket party in Kolkata, we met. And then we exchanged telephone numbers,” she recounted with a smile.Their budding romance was punctuated by significant events, including a memorable phone call Sharmila made to congratulate Tiger on his remarkable performance in a cricket match. “We were going to Nainital for 'Waqt'. That's when he scored a double century in Delhi so that was very famous. So, I called him and he was not at home. So, I left a message congratulating him for the double century as Sharmila Tagore,” she shared.The story took a humorous turn when Sharmila received a strange phone call months later in Mumbai. She was told that she had received five air conditioners from London, a dubious claim given the import restrictions at the time. “I thought somebody was trying to get me into trouble. And I'll go to jail. I have never even ordered them. I got perturbed. There was a number given. So, I rang that number,” she explained. To her surprise, the voice on the other end wasTiger Pataudi , laughing and admitting it was a prank. “So, that's how it happened. And he asked if we could go out for coffee. I said yeah, we'll go out for coffee,” she continued.Their love story blossomed from that playful exchange, leading to a marriage in 1968 that lasted 43 years until Tiger's passing in 2011. Together, they raised three children: actor Saif Ali Khan, jewelry designer Saba Ali Khan, and actress Soha Ali Khan. Their union remains a poignant chapter in India's cultural history, blending the worlds of cinema and sports in a timeless romance.","Sharmila Tagore and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi met at a cricket party in Kolkata.
