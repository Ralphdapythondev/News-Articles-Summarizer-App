"Post the Supreme Court judgment, 6 takes on 6A",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-the-supreme-court-judgment-6-takes-on-6a/articleshow/114364753.cms,"What is the case?



What is the impact of the verdict?



What happens to CAA?



What happens to those on the ground?



What can be the political outcome?



A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld Section 6A of the Citizenship Act , 1955, which makes March 25, 1971, the cut-off date for Indian citizenship in Assam. Section 6A was introduced to give effect to the 1985 Assam Accord , which in turn was the result of a six-year-long student-led movement against illegal infiltration from Bangladesh into Assam. However, the 4:1 majority verdict, while settling some issues, gives rise to other questions, especially in the context of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), 2019.Here are six takeaways from the 6A judgment:Petitioners in the case — including Assam Public Works and Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha — argued that Section 6A was discriminatory because it provided a different cut-off date for citizenship for immigrants entering Assam as opposed to the rest of the country. This needs to be seen in the context of the push from certain sections to revert to 1951 as the cut-off in Assam. Petitioners argued that Section 6A had led to demographic change in the state, threatening ‘indigenous’ people’s rights and culture.What Did SC Majority Verdict Say?The three-judge majority opinion penned by Justice Surya Kant for himself and Justices MM Sundresh and Manoj Misra held that the migrant situation in Assam was unique compared to the rest of the country and that enacting a law to specifically address the issue would not violate the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. CJI DY Chandrachud said in his separate but concurring opinion that application of Section 6A to Assam was reasonable given the magnitude of the migration issue in that state, even though other Indian states may have larger borders with Bangladesh and, in some instances, seen greater influx of migrants. Further, CJI Chandrachud found the cutoff date of March 25,1971, reasonable as it was on that day the Pakistani army had launched Operation Searchlight to crack down on the Bengali nationalist movement in the erstwhile East Pakistan.The verdict settles the debate about the cut-off date for detecting illegal migrants in Assam once and for all. It has also put paid to efforts to push back this date to 1951. Note that Assam govt had recently accepted 1951 as the cut-off year for implementation of certain recommendations of the Justice Biplab Sharma Committee on Clause 6 of the Assam Accord to safeguard the interests of the state’s indigenous people. The committee was set up in 2019 in the wake of the widespread protests against CAA. It now remains to be seen how Assam govt squares its policies to preserve “cultural and linguistic heritage” of Assamese people with SC’s judgment.Anti-CAA groups have seized on the SC verdict to demand that CAA be scrapped. All Assam Students’ Union, which had spearheaded the anti-illegal immigrant agitation in the 1970s and 80s, has welcomed the verdict, saying it clears the decks for the full implementation of the Assam Accord. Does this mean that the citizenship cut-off date of Dec 2014 for non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as provided for by CAA now stands in potential conflict with the SC-backed Section 6A cut-off of March 25, 1971?True, SC did not delve into CAA in this ruling, but it clearly rejected the argument that permitting people with a different culture to reside in Assam would dilute Assamese culture. This has implications for the legal challenge against CAA pending before SC.That’s the million-dollar question. The NRC exercise has already given 31 lakh people papers. CAA is being implemented. In this scenario, identifying, detecting and deporting illegal migrants according to the March 25, 1971, cut-off — which SC will now monitor — is practically unfeasible. It will possibly open another can of political worms and lead to more legal challenges and questions.The verdict is certainly a shot in the arm for the opposition in Assam and anti-CAA groups and a blow to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma. The latter will now be forced into further political jugglery over CAA on the one hand and the demand on the other for going back to the 1951 cut-off, which stemmed from dissatisfaction over the NRC exercise among Assam’s ‘nativist’ groups. BJP saw CAA as a boon for its politics. Himanta has to cater to local aspirations to continue in office. But SC’s verdict, upholding a clear cut-off date for citizenship in Assam, may trouble both Himanta and his party, in different ways.","A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which makes March 25, 1971, the cut-off date for Indian citizenship in Assam.

One bomb hoax can cost an airline over Rs 3 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-bomb-hoax-can-cost-an-airline-over-rs-3-crore/articleshow/114364615.cms,"Costs adding up



‘Financial Terrorism’



An Air India Boeing 777 took off from Mumbai this Monday (October ober 14) with almost 130 tonnes of jet fuel in its tanks for a 16-hour nonstop journey to New York’s JFK airport. Soon after take-off, the airline received a call saying there was a bomb in the plane. JFK-bound AI 119 was immediately diverted and within two hours of take-off, it was preparing to land in Delhi.But there was a problem.“The maximum landing weight of a B777 is 250 tonnes. A full flight like this weighs about 340-350 tonnes with passengers, baggage and cargo on take-off. Landing within two hours means dumping about 100 tones of fuel. At almost Rs 1 lakh per tonne, the fuel wastage cost alone works out to Rs 1 crore,” said a senior pilot.Add to it other expenses like the unexpected landing and parking charges at IGI Airport, putting up over 200 passengers and crew in Delhi hotels, compensating them later for missed connections, grounding of aircraft before it can be back in service after thorough checks and arranging a fresh pair of operating crew, and the aircraft not reaching JFK to fly passengers from there to India on a scheduled return flight — the total cost of this one hoax threat works out to way over Rs 3 crore, say senior officials.The spate of hoax threats since last Sunday — close to 40 by late Thursday — is having a massive financial impact on airlines. Rough estimates by airline officials peg the extra expense at about Rs 60-80 crore.Take the case of Air India B777 (VT-ALM) that took off from Delhi this Tuesday (October 15) for Chicago. Twelve hours later, the aircraft with over 200 passengers on board landed in the remote Canadian town of Iqaluit after a bomb threat. The aircraft landed there on October 15 at 5.21 am EDT. The next commercial flight it flew was three and a half days later. First it reached Chicago from Iqaluit as a ferry flight — with no passengers as the stranded passengers had been flown earlier to Chicago on a Canadian Air Force A330 for which AI will pay — and then took off as a commercial flight to Delhi at 5.15 pm on October 18.The average monthly rental of a B777 is between $400,000 and $600,000 — this works out to an average daily rental of about $17,000. Not flying means $17,000 down the drain every single day. Now, had it not been for the hoax threat, the aircraft would have reached Chicago and then after a few hours, left for Delhi as a regular flight. But not reaching Chicago meant over 200 passengers and crew stranded in Iqaluit for whom accommodation, meals and other basic necessities had to be arranged in a remote town. Then flying them to Chicago on a Canadian Air Force plane. And, meanwhile, having to deal with Delhi-bound passengers in Chicago’s O’Hare Airport whose aircraft didn’t show up because it was stranded in Iqaluit. The overall cost of this one threat would run into over Rs 15-20 crore, including the cost of a B777 grounded for that long, said multiple people.No big airline that has been a victim of these threats in the last few days commented on this issue. “This is the peak festive rush season and we don’t want to create a scare among travellers. Suffice it to say that this is a sort of financial terrorism against airlines and should be dealt with severely,” said a senior airline official.IndiGo, too, has got threats for several flights, both domestic and international. Ve ry often when a flight gets a threat message and is not diverted. The destination airport asks it to hold or hover. This has happened with AI in London, AI Express in Singapore, and perhaps others too. “A B777 burns 7-8 tonnes of fuel every hour and an A320 2.5 tonnes. At Rs 1 lakh per tonne and two hours of hovering, the cost of fuel burn alone is over several crores for all affected airlines,” said a pilot.“Due to the extra time spent in air, very often the same crew can’t operate the next flight this aircraft will operate after being cleared by security agencies post checks. They will need to be rested and given hotel accommodation in that city. It has not been uncommon to have aircraft out of action for 20-25 hours during these crazy hoax message times. While this a force majeure event beyond our control, many passengers who miss connections will take us to court and eventually we will have to settle by paying damages,” said a senior official of a big airline.Making matters worse is the fact there are two types of threats. A specific one where a particular flight number is named or a generic one like the one Air India got on Thursday, saying five AI flights have bombs in them.“Risk assessment is done. The source of the threat is seen, whether it came via X (former Twitter), WhatsApp, call or mail. Based on an evaluation matrix, the code is decided — whether red (very serious), amber (serious) or green (most likely hoax). But in no circumstances is any threat dismissed as it is better to be safe, even if it means losses and angry passengers, than sorry,” said an official.In cases assessed to be serious, flight have to land at the nearest suitable airport. “To avoid oversight landings, we can dump fuel when the aircraft is holding at over 5,000 feet. Fuel jettisoned from that altitude will vapourise. In Delhi, we dump a little south of the capital near Sakras and in Mumbai over the sea, ” said a pilot.","The spate of hoax threats since last Sunday — close to 40 by late Thursday — is having a massive financial impact on airlines. Rough estimates by airline officials peg the extra expense at about Rs 60-80 crore. “This is a sort of financial terrorism against airlines and should be dealt with severely,” said a senior airline official.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114364609,imgsize-971078,width-400,resizemode-4/114364609.jpg"

Travis Kelce defends his Guardians fandom after facing unusual criticism for his ALCS game 1 look



The Cleveland Guardians ' victory over the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the 2024 ALCS was a moment of triumph for fans across the city. Among the elated supporters was Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , a die-hard Guardians fan. However, Kelce's enthusiasm was met with an unexpected twist: a wardrobe controversy. Despite attending Game 1 of the series with Taylor Swift , Kelce opted to skip the Guardians' gear, sparking confusion and criticism among fans.Some questioned his sincerity as a fan, suggesting that his lack of team attire indicated a lack of commitment.Also Read: Denver Broncos dominate the Saints, 33-10, in Sean Payton’s long-awaited return to His Former Home However, Kelce made his stance clear after the Guardians secured their dramatic walk-off win in Game 3. Following the game, Kelce took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his excitement and address those doubting his fandom. The tight end, who grew up in Ohio and played football at the University of Cincinnati, found it baffling that anyone would doubt his allegiance based solely on his clothing choice.It seems odd that such attention would be paid to an outfit, but in today’s digital age, fans often read too much into trivial details. Kelce’s response, defending his lifelong connection to Cleveland sports, couldn’t have come at a better time. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a true fan was Kelce's clear message, emphasizing that his love for the team runs far deeper than just wearing their gear. After all, Kelce’s Ohio upbringing has been a well-known part of his public persona, and his passion for Cleveland sports is something he regularly shares with fans.Following his Twitter response, the Guardians, still basking in the glow of their Game 3 triumph, joined in on the fun. Their social media account poked some lighthearted fun at Kelce, indicating they were more than happy with his support, regardless of what he wore to the game.Kelce has yet to officially rank his favorite MLB teams, but his continued support of the Guardians over the years speaks volumes. Born in Westlake, Ohio, and a Cleveland Heights High School alum, Kelce often references his Cleveland roots alongside his brother Jason on their podcast “New Heights,” which pays homage to their upbringing. Whether or not he dons team apparel, Kelce’s loyalty to his hometown team remains unquestionable, much like his unwavering pride in Cleveland itself.Also Read: Saints CB Marshon Lattimore ruled out during the game against the Broncos after sustaining a hamstring injury","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is a die-hard Cleveland Guardians fan.

NEW DELHI: Actor Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the ' HPZ Token ' mobile app in which several investors were allegedly duped on the pretext of mining Bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies.The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the 34-year-old actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its zonal office in Guwahati.Sources said Bhatia received some funds for making a ""celebrity appearance"" at an event of the app company and there were no ""incriminating"" charges against her.She was called earlier too but she deferred the summons due to work and chose to appear on Thursday, they said.A total of 299 entities, including 76 Chinese-controlled entities in which 10 directors are of Chinese origin while two entities are controlled by other foreign nationals, have been named as accused in the charge sheet filed by the ED in this case in March.The money laundering case stems from an FIR of the cyber crimes unit of Kohima Police that booked various accused under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act for allegedly duping ""gullible"" investors by promising astronomical returns by mining Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.Police said the 'HPZ Token' mobile phone application was used by the accused to ""cheat"" the investors.The agency said bank accounts and merchant IDs were opened by various ""shell entities"" having ""dummy"" directors for the purpose of ""layering"" the proceeds of crime.These funds were ""fraudulently"" received for illegal online gaming and betting and investment for Bitcoin mining , it claimed.For an investment of Rs 57,000, returns of Rs 4,000 per day for three months were promised but money was paid only once and thereafter fresh funds were sought by the accused from the investors, the ED said.Country-wide searches were undertaken by the ED in this case leading to the seizure of immovable assets and deposits worth Rs 455 crore, it said.",Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the'HPZ Token'mobile app. The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332903,imgsize-39750,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114332903.jpg"

There’s no resolution on Article 370. Scaling down demands to mere statehood is a huge setback, especially after seeking votes on the promise of restoring Article 370,” PDP youth president and Pulwama MLA Waheed Parra wrote in a post on X.Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid accused Omar of playing into the hands of BJP --- a stunning reversal from the recent assembly polls when Omar had dubbed Rashid a BJP pawn who fielded candidates of his Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) to split votes. Now, Rashid alleged that NC won its 42 seats because it received “tactical” help from BJP.“NC has promised a fight against Article 370 but Omar is deviating from the main issues by focusing on statehood restoration only,” Rashid said. The MP pointed out that since PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already pledged statehood, stressing on this point while ignoring other “grave issues” tantamounts to a “betrayal” by the new CM.Rasheed claimed Omar had recently spoken about seeking restoration of special status when “BJP would not be in office at the Centre”. “I want to ask him whether Kashmiris should wait 100 years if BJP remains in power till then,” Rasheed said.People’s Conference chief and Handwara MLA Sajjad Lone argued that the resolution should have been passed in the assembly rather than the cabinet.“All across the country, to the best of my knowledge, the assembly is the proper institution for addressing major issues like that of statehood or Article 370. The will of the people of J&K is reflected in the assembly, not in the cabinet. The cabinet is a majoritarian institution. It does not reflect all shades and opinions as per the will of the people,” Lone argued.

The frontal assault of patriarchal institutions is in, all at once, denying any deviance and valuing some over others. In the instance of child marriage, the right to sexuality of a person is systematically dismantled."" He said marrying in childhood objectified the child and imposed mature burdens on children who were not physically or mentally prepared to comprehend the significance of marriage.A woman forced into marriage in childhood to protect her 'chastity' and 'virginity' was denied her right to sexuality, bodily autonomy and the freedom to make choices for herself, he said.He further said, ""Sexuality is not only the orientation a person may have in matters of romance and intimacy but also the ability to navigate the desires of a person regardless of their choice of partner or the option not to have a partner. Men and women alike are victimised by compulsory heterosexuality. In child marriage, their limited agency within heteropatriarchy is also taken away in infancy.""The CJI said child marriage led to irreversible physical and psychological damage in girls and violated their Article 21 right that encompassed their choice in matters of selection of partner, time of marriage, reproductive freedom and sexuality.Early marriage also arrested educational and intellectual progress of a girl, violating her fundamental right under the Right to Education Act, he said, adding that it had equally detrimental impact on boys, who were forced to take up more responsibilities and assume the role of provider.

NEW DELHI: Canada may have taken the plea of free speech and cited legal requirement for more proof to act against pro-Khalistan extremists' alleged political persecution to find sanctuary in its territory, but the country has failed to act on India's requests even for the extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.This has turned the country into a ""safe haven"" for criminals wanted in India, government sources said.Sources here pointed out that no action has been taken against one Gurcharan Singh, accused in a cheating case, although a request was made in 2003. Similarly, Omkar Mal Aggarwal, accused of criminal conspiracy and cheating in a property case, has been wanted since 2016, while India sought the extradition of Jasvinder Pal Singh Walia in 2022 in a case related to gang rape and blackmail of a female employee of his spa during 2014-15, which is pending. Last year, a plea was made against Ravinder Singh for cruelty against his wife, after he fled the country.Sources said there are formal and informal channels via which information is exchanged but a common thread is there - reluctance on part of Canadian authorities.On several occasions, India has suggested that the Canadian government check the antecedents of individuals who enter the country illegally and later seek asylum, but the suggestion has been ignored. Even the caution that the ""open door"" policy is a recipe for disaster, as those who have profited from crime are going to ply their dark trade in their new home, has not been heeded. ""Nor have the instances vindicating the warning,"" said a senior source.In the case of terrorists and criminals, Indian authorities have shared call details and even the location of suspects and suggested that action could be taken under Canadian laws but complained that they have always hit a wall.Sources also dismissed the grounds of ""higher bar"" and ""due process"" refrained by Canadian agencies to justify their action against terrorists entering the country camouflaged as ""dissenters who are facing prosecution for political reasons"" as just an alibi, saying the concerns have never come in the way of tough action against operatives and sympathisers of IS and their family members. ""The indifference and resistance to our requests... has been visceral and has been the norm since 2003,"" said the source.In fact, after years of informal sharing of information and dossiers, which Canada said didn't meet their legal requirements, a formal arrangement was worked out between NIA and RCMP but there has not been much headway.Even in the 1980s when militancy was at its peak in Punjab, Canada under then PM Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father, harboured Khalistani terrorists, including those involved in murders and bombings, including that of Kanishka that killed hundreds of passengers.In recent years too, as Sikh extremists decided to make Canada as their base for anti-India activities, government repeatedly flagged its concern and shared evidence, including links with Pakistan, but has not met with much success. What has raised further eyebrows in New Delhi is how many extremists accused of serious terror charges have even been given official assignments.","Canada has failed to act on India's requests even for the extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.

I would not prejudge who exactly will be invited, and what are the criteria, but certainly, those countries should be economically ambitious and oppose illegitimate sanctions against member-states,"" said Alipov, speaking in an online conference organised by the Centre for Global India Insights.A Russian minister was quoted as saying in Islamabad earlier this year that Moscow will back Pakistan's membership bid.""I presume we are all against the phantom itching for dictating and restricting cooperation with other nations.

Artificial stones pose deadly silicosis risk to workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/artificial-stones-pose-deadly-silicosis-risk-to-workers-study/articleshow/114364387.cms,"NEW DELHI: Artificial stone, also known as engineered stone or quartz , may make your kitchen look beautiful but, leading medical experts from across the globe warn it is endangering the lives of workmen involved in its cutting and polishing.Artificial stones are made from crushed rocks bound together with resins. It has aesthetic appeal. It's easier to work with due to absence of natural imperfections, and it's more resistant to damage than natural stone - leading to its popularity over the past decade.However, according to a recent study published in journal Thorax, its increasing popularity has been accompanied by the emergence of a severe and rapidly progressive form of silicosis (artificial stone silicosis), largely driven by its high (more than 90%) silica content compared with marble (3%) and granite (30%), and the fine dust it generates when cut.""When worktops are prepared for installation, they are often 'dry' cut and polished with an angle grinder or other tools without the use of water to suppress dust generation, further boosting the volume of fine dust,"" the researchers explain.The Thorax study documents eight cases of workers with an average age of 34 suffering from serious lung disease while preparing artificial stones in the UK. Of them, two were assessed for lung transplant; three for autoimmune disease and two others were treated for opportunistic lung infection caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria, the Thorax study states.The UK is currently reviewing exposure limits for crystalline silica dust amid mounting international concerns about its health impacts. ""Inhalation of silica, a common mineral found in sand, is known to cause scarring of lungs and predispose a person to tuberculosis. I used to see several construction workers suffering from both at Safdarjung Hospital. The degree of illness varied depending on the duration of exposure,"" Dr J C Suri, the former head of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said.Dr Suri said cutting and polishing of artificial stones leads to release of fine silica dust that are likely to be inhaled compared to the silica dust released while cutting or polishing other materials used for making kitchen tops, for example granite. ""Doing away with the use of these stones may be difficult, but one can certainly advocate safety measures for workers involved in the cutting, polishing and installation of these stones to reduce the risk of silicosis - lung disease caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica. This may include use of nasal filters and tech-use to reduce exposure to silica dust,"" he added.","Artificial stones are made from crushed rocks bound together with resins.

RANCHI: BJP announced Friday it would field candidates in 68 of Jharkhand ’s 81 assembly seats in the two-phase polls starting Nov 13, leaving the lion’s share of the rest – 10 seats – to the Sudesh Mahto-led Ajsu-P . Two seats for Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and one for Union minister Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas) rounded off NDA ’s seat-sharing math, with Jitan Manjhi’s HAM missing out.In 2019, BJP fought 79 seats and won 25. Just two out of 53 Ajsu-P candidates won.Assam CM and BJP’s Jharkhand co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma unveiled the list with the caveat that there could be “last-minute tweaks”, based “purely on strategy” after analysing the governing JMM-Congress combine's choice of candidates.Hours after BJP announced it would contest 68 out of 81 Jharkhand seats and leave the rest for NDA allies, JMM predicted infighting in the bloc once the constituents started announcing their candidates.JMM general secretary and spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said BJP “ceded” seats in Jharkhand to its allies to keep its alliance at the Centre afloat.Sarma, who held a press conference at BJP’s state headquarters in Ranchi with Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Mahto and former chief minister Babulal Marandi, said the first list of candidates would be announced along with those for Maharashtra “within the next two days”.BJP and AJSU-P intend to campaign jointly with a blend of national and regional issues, but there will be no predetermined chief ministerial candidate. “The will be contested under the stewardship of our leaders here and the karyakartas. The chief ministerial face will be decided after the election,” Sarma said.BJP chose to contest fewer seats compared to the last election, purportedly to prevent vote division. “We contested against each other five years ago, and it benefited the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance,” AJSU-P spokesperson Devsharan Bhagat said.Mahto dismissed speculation that he was disappointed at his party being allocated 10 seats. “There is no difference in opinion among us regarding seat-sharing.
