NEW DELHI: Banda district in Uttar Pradesh ’s Bundelkhand region, which was once known for drought and farmer suicides, on Tuesday bagged the best district (North Zone) national award for showcasing exceptional intiatives in water management and conservation. Also, UP has secured the second position in the state category after Odisha in water conservation and management in the country.President Droupadi Murmu honoured UP with the second place and Banda with the best district (north zone) award during the 5th Rashtriya Jal Puraskar-2023 in New Delhi on Tuesday.Welcoming the awards, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath posted on X, “Under the guidance of respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, many unprecedented works are being done in the direction of ' Jal Shakti ' in Uttar Pradesh. This achievement is the result of the Uttar Pradesh government giving priority to water conservation, management and public participation. Heartiest congratulations to the people of the state and all those involved in this sacred work of water conservation and promotion!”Each and every house in around 18,000 villages of UP have received drinking water supply under the government’s Har Ghar Nal Scheme.IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal , who was till recently Banda DM, received the award on behalf of the district. Chief development officer of Banda, Ved Prakash Maurya, was also present at the award ceremony.“Honoured to receive National Water Awards first prize from Hon’ble President of India for district Banda under best district category. Grateful to have been a part of Team Banda and to drive the mission to transform Banda from water scarce to water surplus district,” DM Nagpal posted on X. Nagpal, who is currently Lakhimpur Kheri DM, had worked as Banda DM for over 14 months during which she took several big initiatives for water conservation and management.The barren and hilly region of Banda, with difficult topography and sparse vegetation, made it difficult for groundwater re-harvesting. Though the average rainfall in the Bundelkhand district in the year 2019 was 902 mm, it was higher than that of Punjab and Haryana, 636 mm and 563 mm, respectively. Despite low rainfall, the two northwestern states could tackle the water crisis because of rainwater harvesting. Bundelkhand, on the other hand, lagged on that front.However, several efforts were taken by the UP government over the past several years for water conservation in the district. Under these programmes, 405 ponds of the district were revived and 4,690 soak pits constructed, and sprinkler & drip irrigation systems were being used for farming, which saved a lot of water. Initiatives were also taken for mapping of ponds, check dams and other water structures. A massive tree plantation drive was also undertaken for water conservation.The Aviral Jal Abhiyan is also being run in Banda district in which awareness campaigns are being run regularly and workshops are being organised to increase people's participation.IAS officer Heera Lal , who was the DM of Banda from August 2018 to February 2020, had also played a significant role for water conservation in order to change the lives of people in the drought-hit district during his tenure. Speaking to TOI, Heeral Lal, who is currently special secretary in the irrigation department of the UP government, said, “During my tenure, 2,200 private wells and over 2.200 government wells were desilted and over 1,000 wells were dug up.” He had suggested shaft digging near wells or hand pumps to conserve rainwater and pushed for a massive tree plantation drive. “Trees help us store and conserve water. Hence, plant as many trees as possible in your vicinity,” he used to tell villagers. For the best district award to Banda, Heera said, “The credit goes to people as they continued the water conservation efforts even after my transfer.”",Banda district in Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand region bagged the best district (North Zone) national award for showcasing exceptional intiatives in water management and conservation.

""However, there was a slight improvement in MDDF from the National Family Health Survey-3 when 87% of this age group were MDDF to 77% as per the NFHS-5 conducted in 2019-2021,"" said author Gaurav Gunnal from the International Institute for Population Sciences , Deonar.Maharashtra, along with seven other states including UP, Rajasthan, and Gujarat, had high MDDF of over 80%. Only 95 districts in the south, east, and the northeast out of India's 707 districts had a low prevalence of dietary failure at 60% and lower.""Dietary failure was higher among children who were females, from lower socio-economic groups, did not receive food from anganwadi centres, and were born to younger mothers,"" said Gunnal and co-author Dhruvi Bagaria from Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar. Dietary diversity helps combat deficiency of micronutrients that play an important role in development and growth. Poor nutrition increases risks of delayed motor and cognitive development, weak learning, low immunity, poor metabolism, memory, and increased susceptibility to infections.According to NFHS-5, 1 in every 3 children is underweight and stunted, while 1 in every 5 children is wasted in India. Dr Abhay Shukla of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said Maharashtra ranks lowest among states as far as ""wasting"" (over 25%) and ""severe wasting"" (over 10%) is concerned.

Therefore, to prevent further deterioration of air quality, the CAQM sub-committee… has taken the call to invoke the 11-point action plan as per Stage-II of the revised GRAP in entire NCR,” said.The curbs do not allow use of portable DG sets below 19KW, permitting them only for emergency use, as at present there are no specific means to control emissions from this category of machines. The rule, however, also states that DG sets between 19kW to 63kW, if not retrofitted or functioning on dual fuel, will only be permitted for emergency services –such as hospitals, lifts, etc. – if there’s no gas infrastructure in the given region.Earlier, on October 15, CAQM imposed Stage I restrictions when the city’s AQI turned 'poor'.On Monday, the share of stubble burning in the region’s pollution load increased to around 3.2% from 1.8% a day earlier.

(Reuters)

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Canadian NDP MPs speaking during an emergency debate in parliament on foreign interference from the Indian government in Canada have called for the RSS to be designated a terrorist organisation in Canada, for BJP officials who have called for racist and genocidal violence to be banned from the country, an end to sharing information, prohibiting the sale of Canadian arms, and for sanctions against India.MPs in the Canadian House of Commons spoke on Monday night about how Canadian Sikhs felt frightened and many had even had extortion calls, had their homes shot at, and some had had to spend thousands of dollars on security or were living in hotels owing to threats from criminal gangs.Liberal MP Ruby Sahota MP said: “I have had constituents come to me with videos of FaceTime calls from leaders of gangs sitting in prisons in India. How does that happen? How are people who are imprisoned in India contacting my constituents in order to extort them through local gang organisers in this country? There has to be foreign interference involved.” She agreed that “those who are in violation of human rights should not be let into this country”.New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Heather McPhersen called on Canada to stop selling arms to India, a ban on entry for BJP officials from India who have called for race violence and genocidal violence against minorities, and for sanctions on India.Liberal MP Randeep Sarai said: “I think all tools are at the disposal of government and should be used.” He said the first measure was expulsion of Indian diplomats and “more measures will be forthcoming… The world should unite against any government that ever thinks or tries to act in such a manner,” he said, referring to allegations by the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) that agents of India’s government were involved in multiple homicides and extortions.In the debate, which went on until midnight, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said: “We should be pausing information sharing with India. We should not be giving intelligence regarding Canadian citizens to a country and a government alleged to have hired gangs to commit violence against Canadians for over a year.” He also said: ""There is a violent, extremist, right-wing organisation known as the RSS… it is very divisive, and it has branches across the world, including here in Canada. It needs to be banned.”Hindu and Sikh Canadian MPs were united in condemning India’s alleged actions in Canada, which Delhi denies.Liberal MP Randeep Sarai said: “To Hindu Canadians I want to be unequivocally clear. This is not a Sikh or Hindu issue. This is an issue of Canadians versus government of India… Foreign interference from India is at all-time high and far exceeds that from China, Russia, or Iran.”The political parties each blamed each other for the rise in foreign interference in Canada.Conservatives and NDP blasted Liberals for taking four years to set up a foreign agent registry. The Liberals accused the Conservative leadership race of Indian interference.Conservative MP Jasraj Singh Hallan said: “Extortions are up. Violent crime is up. All these things have been happening because of soft-on-crime policies. That is the reality of living in Canada today.” He said “everything is politics” to the Trudeau government, blaming them for voting against his party’s extortion bill.Extortion has gone up 360 per cent , homicides are up 28 per cent , violent crime is up 50 per cent , and violent gun crime up 116 per cent under Trudeau’s leadership. “The Liberals’ policies fostered this environment,” said Conservative MP Arpan Khanna.","MPs in the Canadian House of Commons spoke on Monday night about how Canadian Sikhs felt frightened.

Secularism means live and let live, says SC

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday argued for retention of madrassas and reform of their education system before the Supreme Court and said striking down of the UP Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 by Allahabad high court was wrong even though the state had accepted the verdict and not appealed against it.Acting on a bunch of appeals, the SC on Apr 5 stayed the March 22 judgment of the high court which had held the Act to be violative of principles of secularism, and directed the state to admit more than 12 lakh students studying in 13,364 madrassas in regular schools recognised by the state education board.To a question from a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for UP govt, said the state had defended the validity of the Act but accepted the verdict of the constitutional court.""It is our legislation. The state has wide powers to regulate and reform madrassa education,"" said the ASG.The high court should not have struck down the Act. It could have examined the validity of certain provisions in the light of Article 21A and Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009,” he said.The bench agreed with him and said, “The state has a vital interest in mainstreaming madrassas; otherwise how do these institutions produce worthy citizens if they are not acquainted with math, science and other mainstream subjects? We will interpret the Act that way. But to strike down the Act entirely is akin to throwing the baby with bath water.”The bench’s view synced with the arguments of madrassas and different Muslim organisations. Senior advocate A M Singhvi pointed out that if the state was keen to reform madrassa education, it should not have sat on Madarsa Board’s Oct 2021 decision to include elementary mathematics and science in classes up to secondary level till date.Supporting HC’s decision, advocate Guru Krishna Kumar argued that UP Board of Madarsa Education Act, being based solely on religion, is non-secular. The CJI said, “India is essentially a religious country. Can religious instructions not be regarded as education? Is it in national interest to ban madrassas, or should they be mainstreamed? People will send their children to madrassas even if they are not recognised. It would be for state to regulate madrassa education to mainstream the syllabus.”The bench said, “We must look at the broad sweep of the canvas. Religious instructions are not confined only to Muslim community, it is there in every religious community. India is a melting pot of cultures. Let us preserve it that way. Secularism means live & let live.”","Supreme Court stayed the March 22 judgment of the high court which had held the Act to be violative of principles of secularism.

Chopper pilot had experience in rescue operations in high-risk

zones

NAGPUR: Captain Reena Varughese was a rookie pilot in 2009 when Maoists shot down a helicopter ferrying senior police and polling officials in Laheri on the fringes of Abujmarh, the 'People's Liberation Guerrilla Army' (PLGA) headquarters straddling Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.Fifteen years later, Varughese knew what she was getting into when her 13-seater Dauphin-N Pawan Hans chopper took off from Gadchiroli and flew into the Maoist heartland, 100km away.Varughese and her crew's daredevil act of risking a mortar hit to rescue a wounded C-60 commando in the middle of Monday's eight-hour siege of the booby-trapped PLGA den was the defining moment of the operation in which five Maoists being killed.Sources said Varughese, who prefers being in the shadows, knew it was impossible to land on the rocky, forested terrain. Putting her co-pilot in charge, she jumped off the chopper as it hovered 11ft above the ground amid swirling dust.The chopper was a sitting duck for the Maoists, who are known to possess a fleet of unmanned drones to counter airborne raids. But Varughese and the crew pulled off what seemed impossible, lifting to safety the wounded C-60 commando who lay bleeding for three hours after taking three bullets.“Drawing from her experience in rescue and evacuation in high-risk zones, including Maoist-hit areas of Jagdalpur, Sukma and Chintagufa in Chhattisgarh, Varughese demonstrated uncanny ability in taking up the challenge head-on,” a source said. The wounded commando was flown to Gadchiroli within 30 minutes, from where he was taken to a Nagpur hospital, where his condition was reported to be stable till Tuesday evening. Varughese, who completed her BTech in aeronautical engineering before training to be a pilot, was part of the Pawan Hans operation to evacuate Covid patients from Lakshadweep Islands to Kochi during the pandemic.",Captain Reena Varughese was a rookie pilot in 2009 when Maoists shot down a helicopter ferrying senior police and polling officials in Laheri.

NAGPUR: C-60 commando Kumod Atram, who was airlifted in a critical condition from the Abujmarh battlefield on Monday, says he has participated in 22 encounters over eight years. ""Ab tak unchaalis,"" he said when asked about the toll he had inflicted personally on the Maoists .Though down with gunshot injuries, he told TOI from his hospital bed in Nagpur that he's raring to go again.Atram was hit when he turned to see his buddy pair, who came under heavy close-range fire from guerrillas. Despite crouching behind a broad tree trunk, Atram was hit thrice when he sought to give cover to his fellow commando. Atram bled profusely for 30 minutes before a fellow commando could bring the blood-clotting kit, stashed 50m away, in the midst of unceasing gunfire.Atram was part of the gun battle with the Maoists' ""Company Number 10"" formation in which five People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) fighters were shot dead.The slain guerrillas had around 300 offences against them and carried a total bounty of Rs 38 lakh. Two senior women divisional committee members, Jaya Pada and Ankalu Tulavi, were among those killed.Atram trekked 72 hours across the tough terrain of Abujmarh with 22 commandos and CRPF personnel before engaging with PLGA fighters camping at two different sites 7 km apart.The two camp sites tried to ambush the advancing security forces, but came under siege.Gadchiroli police and anti-Naxal operation officials said the operation was launched to thwart Maoist plans to disrupt the November 20 Maharashtra polls.","C-60 commando Kumod Atram was airlifted in a critical condition from the Abujmarh battlefield on Monday.

Son’s IAS dream shattered in Kashmir; Karva Chauth turns to mourning in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sons-ias-dream-shattered-in-kashmir-karva-chauth-turns-to-mourning-in-jammu/articleshow/114437131.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Amid grief and disbelief, two families — one from Kashmir ’s Budgam district and the other from Jammu — find themselves bound by an unimaginable tragedy. What was meant to be a festive time of Karva Chauth for architectural designer Shashi Bhushan Abrol’s wife and children, and a hopeful return to routine life for Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s family, has now become a period of mourning and shattered dreams.Sunday’s terrorist attack in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district robbed them of their loved ones, plunging moments of joy into an abyss of sorrow. Abrol and Dar were employees of construction company APCO Infratech and among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.In Naidgam village of Budgam, the air was heavy with grief as 52-year-old Dar was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard Monday. His family — his mother, wife, and three children — remained stunned by the loss. “My son, where have you gone?” wailed his mother.One of the most heartbreaking moments came from his teenage son Mohsin Dar, who revealed how his father had been his greatest supporter. “I wanted to become an IAS officer , and he had promised to help me fulfill this dream. Now that dream is gone,” he said.The timing of the physician’s death added another layer of heartbreak — just days earlier, he had celebrated the wedding of his daughter. He had been scheduled to return home to Budgam to participate in after-wedding ceremonies, but fate had other plans.The loss has shaken the entire community. “Dr Sahib was a man of honour, a professional who served us with humility and faith,” said Ghulam Mohammad Dar, a local elder. “We were just celebrating his daughter’s wedding, and now we’re mourning his death.”The village condemned the attackers and called for justice. “This loss is not just personal; it is a blow to humanity,” said a resident. “The ones responsible must be brought to justice.”Over 300km away, the Abrol family in Jammu is grappling with the same nightmare. Shashi Abrol’s wife Ruchi had kept a Karva Chauth fast, praying for her husband’s long life. But instead of breaking her fast with a loving conversation, she received news of his death.Ruchi, her voice choked with grief, recounted her last conversation with her husband. “He called me in the evening, and everything seemed normal. I told him I would call again after finishing the temple rituals. But after that, his phone went silent.”It was only late that night — as Ruchi eagerly waited for a video call from her husband to break the fast — that the family learned of the tragedy through media reports. “We were all trying to comfort her, but we had no idea what had happened,” Ruchi’s sister-in-law Divya said.Married for 20 years, Shashi leaves behind his parents, wife, and two children.The family is left with not only their grief but also practical challenges. “Shashi was the sole breadwinner,” said his father Jagdish Raj Abrol. “His wife is a simple housewife. How will she raise the children alone?”Divya said Shashi’s dream was to see his son become an engineer. “He last came home two months ago to help with his son’s engineering college admission. His biggest hope was to see him succeed, but now everything is uncertain.”In the midst of their pain, the Abrol and Dar families shared the same plea: that those responsible for this tragedy be held accountable, and that the government extend support to help them rebuild wrecked lives. Still, they know no amount of justice can replace the fathers, sons, and husbands they lost — men whose love, dreams, and hopes for their families were stolen in a moment of senseless violence.","Shashi Bhushan Abrol and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar were among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.

MUMBAI: After weeklong parleys marked by a series of confrontations between Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and MPCC president Nana Patole, Maha Vikas Aghadi on Tuesday evening reached a consensus on seat-sharing for the assembly elections.

Sikh businessman had praised Modi’s outreach to secessionists

Two local criminals of Canada, arrested on charges of killing Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik - a rival of slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - have pleaded guilty in a Canadian court, confirming a gangland killing angle. Malik was an accused in the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight (named after Kanishka) that killed 329 people, but was acquitted for lack of evidence.Malik was shot dead on July 14, 2022 by Tanner Fox (23) and Jose Lopez (25), local goons with a history of run-ins with the law.Less than a year later, Nijjar, initially a suspect in Malik's killing, was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, in Surrey, British Columbia.Fox and Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Malik amid high drama in court where they attacked each other, said local reports. They filed their pleas in British Columbia Supreme Court on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder.Malik, local media said, had annoyed Nijjar and his aides by appealing for reconciliation with the Indian State.Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik had praised PM Modi’s outreach to those who wished to disengage with secessionists.A probe by Canadian Police in 2022 had revealed that Nijjar was in a legal dispute with Malik over the issue of the printing of the Sikh holy book — Guru Granth Sahib — in Surrey in violation of a religious edict issued by Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat. Malik’s son had filed a lawsuit against Nijjar to reclaim a specialised printing press. According to local media reports, Malik and his associate Balwant Singh Bandher had entrusted the press to Surrey’sGuru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Aug 2020.Fox, from Abbotsford in British Columbia, hails from a town plagued by gang violence. His criminal record dates back to Nov 2019 when Abbotsford Police arrested him, then 19, for a parking lot stabbing incident involving a 17-year-old victim. He was sentenced to four months in prison besides two years of probation. Fox was out on bail in another offence at the time of Malik’s murder. Lopez was also convicted with a 18-month sentence in Sept 2019 on charges of assault and use of weapon for an incident in Abbotsford reported in 2018.Malik (75) was shot several times in his car outside his family business. The Canadian Police had also zeroed in on two suspicious vehicles — a burnt car and another which was supposedly the getaway vehicle used by the assassins after the murder. The modus operandi involving a “car on fire” was reminiscent of several gang-related killings in the area in the recent past. It was employed also in the killing of one Gagandeep Sandhu (29) who was shot dead in his car in Burnaby area around the time Nijjar was killed.","Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik had praised PM Modi’s outreach to those who wished to disengage with secessionists.

NEW DELHI: After much suspense, Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch is scheduled to appear before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament on Thursday, a meeting that on agenda is slated to be a performance review of the top regulator, but which may result in fireworks over its functioning as well as about the recent allegations of impropriety levelled against Buch.Well-placed sources said Buch had sought an exemption from the PAC, but was denied. They said she should be present before the committee.The agenda of the committee's meeting is ""briefing by audit followed by oral evidence of the representatives of ministry of finance and Sebi on the subject 'performance review of regulatory bodies established by Act of Parliament'.""When the summons were issued to Buch for appearance this month, BJP protested the decision of the PAC headed by Congress MP and AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, and attributed political motives to his move. BJP members had also written a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker protesting the summons. However, the issue appears to have settled in favour of the PAC summons.Sources said BJP has issued a whip to its members to attend the meeting, and protests against opposition members on their line of questioning may be in the offing. Though the said agenda is limited to the Sebi's functioning, political leaders believe that the Sebi chief headed team may be subjected to questions about the regulator's functioning, which gained prominence over the issue of industrialist Adani in the wake of the allegations levelled by US short-seller Hindenburg .Also, specific questions could be asked to Buch about allegations of financial misconduct and of conflict of interest. While the charges against Buch were first levelled by Hindenburg, they were followed up by various whistleblowers, and by the opposition led by Congress, triggering a political storm. Buch and her husband have rebutted the allegations.","Madhabi Buch is scheduled to appear before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Striking a note of caution a day after the India-China agreement on ""patrolling arrangements"" was announced, General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the two armies are trying to "" restore trust "" and ""reassure each other"", which when fully achieved should lead to disengagement , de-escalation and de-induction of troops in eastern Ladakh .The Army chief's remarks come even as Indian and Chinese military commanders on the ground are working out the modalities for the resumption of patrolling, which will be coordinated to prevent any possibility of the rival troops confronting each other, and the subsequent disengagement and verification process at the major face-off sites in Depsang and Demchok.The government, however, has refused so far to answer queries on whether China has extracted concessions on some patrolling rights in Arunachal in lieu of the agreement finalised for eastern Ladakh.General Dwivedi, on his part, said India's position from the very beginning has been on the need for China to restore the status quo along the Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) as it existed before the People's Liberation Army's multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.""Thereafter, we will be looking at disengagement, de-escalation and normal management of the LAC. And this normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that also,"" the Army chief said, after delivering a lecture at defence think-tank USI.""As of now, we are trying to restore trust. It will get restored once we are able to see each other and we are able to convince and reassure each other that we are not creeping into the buffer zones that have been created... (the resumption of) patrolling gets you that kind of advantage and that is what is commencing. And, as we restore trust, the other stages will also follow through,"" he added.India and China had earlier established no-patrol buffer zones, varying from 3-km to 10-km, after troop disengagements on both banks of Pangong Tso, including the Kailash range, Galwan Valley and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last happening in Sept 2022. But the buffer zones have largely come up in areas that India considers its territory.With the disengagement now slated for the strategically located Depsang Plains and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok, a senior officer told TOI that India should guard against ""Doklam being repeated"" in eastern Ladakh. ""Trust but verify. China should not be allowed to change facts on the ground and then present them as a fait accompli,"" he said.There was a 73-day face-off on the Bhutanese territory of Doklam in 2017 after Indian troops blocked Chinese attempts to extend its motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA constructed massive military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam.The massive way in which China has strengthened its forward military positions as well as built ""permanent defences"" and infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC over the last four years, especially across eastern Ladakh, the PLA is unlikely to return to its peacetime locations anytime soon. ""The entire process of disengagement, de-escalation and de-induction, if it actually happens on the ground, will take months,"" the officer said.","General Upendra Dwivedi said the two armies are trying to "" restore trust "" and ""reassure each other"" The Army chief's remarks come even as Indian and Chinese military commanders on the ground are working out the modalities for the resumption of patrolling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114479738,imgsize-1664081,width-400,resizemode-4/114479738.jpg"
