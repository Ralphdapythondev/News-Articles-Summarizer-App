Because we bring a way of life to the rest of the world, that is about inclusivity, about peace, about the peaceful resolution of disputes, about the rule of law, and it's about hearing everyone's voice in a society,"" Richard Verma , the deputy secretary of state for management and resources said at the prestigious Hudson Institute, in response to a question, after he delivered remarks on India-US relationship.Verma said the relationship between India and US is ""a very different mode"" than how some of the adversaries of the latter operate.The diplomat noted that this uniqueness is why President Joe Biden has described the relationship between both countries as the ""defining relationship of this century"".He recalled that nearly 20 years ago, when he stood with then-Senator Biden and staff director Tony Blinken in the Senate, Biden had remarked that if the US and India were the closest friends and partners by 2020, the world would be a safer place.""Not just because we have two big militaries, not just because we have two big economies, but because we actually stand for something that matters to people in their daily lives across the world,"" Verma said.In response to a question on Quad , Verma said it aims to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity.""I look at what the Quad has, the kinds of statements and pronouncements it's made on technology, for example ...technology for good, not to harass, not to surveil, not to misinform, laying out a set of key principles, going even further on some of our work on quantum computing and cybersecurity,"" he said.""When I look at what the Quad has said and done on energy transition, trade, rule-based order, I don't think it has to take on a military character.

Highest FD rates: Fixed deposit (FD) investors have a cause for celebration as they can still secure interest rates of approximately 9% on their deposits at certain small finance banks. These high interest rates are applicable to deposits below Rs 3 crore and are available to individuals under the age of 60.

However, financial experts anticipate that this decision may mark the final pause before the central bank initiates a sequence of interest rate reductions in the near future.Consequently, the interest rates offered on bank fixed deposits are likely to experience a gradual decline over the coming months. While FD investors have enjoyed the benefits of rising interest rates in the recent past, employing the same investment approach may not yield comparable returns in a scenario characterized by falling interest rates.For individuals with surplus funds or FDs nearing maturity, the present circumstances could present an ideal opportunity to safeguard their investments by locking in the prevailing high interest rates, say experts.", Fixed deposit (FD) investors have a cause for celebration as they can still secure interest rates of approximately 9% on their deposits at certain small finance banks.

Police confiscated two Palestinian flags.In neighbouring Davangere, about 60km away, disagreement surfaced over placement of flags on a mobile tower near the police station in Gandhinagar on Sunday evening, leading to communal unrest.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures. Several FIRs have been lodged in relation to the protests, and police injuries were reported during earlier confrontations in Shimla.","Hindu groups demand action against alleged illegal construction in Shimla.

GUWAHATI: Over a year after the first round of violence, Manipur continues to simmer because of a deep polarisation on ethnic lines which has spread to govt officials and police, easy availability of weapons and sustained misinformation by all stakeholders, as per Lt Gen Rana Pratap Kalita (retd), who headed the Army’s Eastern Command until nine months ago.“Unless these three basic factors are addressed, the violence will continue,” Lt Gen Kalita told TOI.China, with its “history of keeping the pot boiling” in India’s Northeast, might be fomenting ethnic unrest in Manipur, the general said, adding that China and neighbouring Myanmar weren’t involved in the initial phase of the conflict but that may no longer be the case.Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday announced Centre’s decision to provide commodities at reasonable prices to common people of strife-hit Manipur through its Kendriya Police Kalyan Bhandar (KPKB) outlets, starting Tuesday.“In line with PM @narendramodi Ji’s commitment, MHA is launching an initiative to provide commodities to people of Manipur at reasonable prices. Now Kendriya Police Kalyan Bhandars will be open for common people from Sept17, 2024,” Shah said in a post on X. “In addition to 21 existing Bhandars, 16 new ones will be opened. Among 16 new centres, eight will be in (Imphal) Valley, and remaining eight in the hills,” he added.KPKB are a welfare initiative launched by MHA in 2006 to provide consumer goods to personnel and kin of serving and retired members of central armed police forces , central police organisations and state police forces, at rates cheaper than open market. There are 119 master bhandars as warehouses and over 1,800 subsidiary bhandars as retail outlets.Central purchase committee of KPKB successfully negotiates with the firms to get maximum discounts along with consumer promotional offers on products in order to save hard earned money of KPKB beneficiaries."," Manipur continues to simmer because of a deep polarisation on ethnic lines which has spread to govt officials and police.

And on the back foot is PDP , which tied up with BJP that opened the floodgates.The Kashmir contest will decide the fate of PDP, which, in its 25th year of existence, is in a battle of survival.Voting in south Kashmir in the first phase, the stronghold of PDP, will set the tone. It is significant that Mehbooba Mufti , who lost the Lok Sabha election to NC from Anantnag, has opted out of the assembly polls and is instead campaigning with gusto to ensure the party stays afloat. In her place, debutant daughter Iltija Mufti has become the third generation of Mufti clan to join electoral politics, and is in a keen fight from family borough Bijbehara.Mohd Ibrahim in Dooru-Shahbad echoed the many political analysts by remarking, ""PDP knows it is fighting against serious odds.""All regional parties of Kashmir have had a dalliance with BJP after it came to power in Delhi in 1998. But the benign face of Vajpayee and BJP's lack of ambition in Kashmir region did not roil the politics. In contrast, the aggression of PM Modi's BJP, which took away special status for J&K and downgraded it to a UT, is raising suspicions about Independents or new parties like Engineer Rashid 's AIP, Ghulam Nabi Azad 's DPAP or Apni Party.For PDP, this ubiquitous search for the ""Delhi hand"" has proved a nightmare scenario because it struck an alliance with BJP in 2015 and brought it to power in the state. Some believe PDP would have breezed past its earlier partnership with BJP, especially since the latter broke the tieup in 2018. But Centre's 2019 decision on Article 370 and the subsequent clampdown renewed the glare on PDP, in retrospect.The party appears alone, facing fire from all sides. While Engineer Rashid, who won the LS election in Baramulla from prison defeating NC's Omar Abdullah and who has presented himself as the ""untainted"" one, is targetting PDP and NC, in a cold blooded move distanced itself from the Mufti outfit after aligning with it as part of the 'Gupkar alliance' created as the resistance bloc in the post-370 scenario. Besides, this year, the banned Jamaat-e-Islami is fighting elections after three decades by supporting Independents and Rashid's candidates, and even fielding its own Independents. The direct loser of the Jamaat move could be PDP which was boosted by Jamaat support for years.Seats across Anantnag, Kulgam, Shopian and Pulwama will decide if PDP has a future in an increasingly competitive turf. Recently, Mehbooba tugged emotional chords by praising the people for changing the ""two party"" political culture, referring to PDP's founding in 1999.","The Kashmir contest will decide the fate of PDP, which, in its 25th year of existence, is in a battle of survival.

Odisha’s Subhadra Scheme paves the way for women’s empowerment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odishas-subhadra-scheme-paves-the-way-for-womens-empowerment/articleshow/113409019.cms,"(The author is the Union education minister. Views expressed are personal)

In the intricate tapestry of nation-building, women often serve as the backbone of progress. This profound recognition is embodied in the newly announced ‘Subhadra’ scheme, being launched by PM Narendra Modi on September 17 —the day that marks his birthday. This significant initiative, designed explicitly for the women of Odisha, reflects a broader commitment to empowerment of women, who are undeniably the true architects of the nation’s future.The scheme, named after Devi Subhadra — beloved sister of the presiding deities of Odisha: Lord Jagannath and Lord Balabhadra — captures the essence of Odisha’s rich cultural heritage that venerates feminine strength and guardianship. By honouring this ancestral legacy, the Subhadra initiative aims to elevate women in Odisha, providing them with vital resources to rise and thrive.With an ambitious budget of Rs 55,825 crore allocated for the next five years (2024-2029), the Subhadra scheme promises annual financial assistance of Rs 10,000 for eligible women beneficiaries aged between 21 and 60. This support will be dispersed in two installments of Rs 5,000 each: one coinciding with Raksha Bandhan and the other with International Women’s Day — two dates laden with significance that symbolize protection and celebration of womanhood.Thus, an eligible woman beneficiary will receive Rs 50,000 in five years. It is estimated that more than a crore of eligible women will benefit from Subhadra scheme, thus making it — in coverage terms — the state’s large stever welfare scheme.The Modi government has already put in place a credible ecosystem with seamless integration with — what is known as — the JAM trinity: Jan Dhan account, Aadhaar and mobile number of the beneficiaries. This has resulted in hasslefree direct transfer of financial benefits under various public welfare schemes thus curbing the potential of corrupt practices. Today, nearly one crore women of Odisha have a Jan Dhan bank account; thus, an efficient implementation of Subhadra scheme and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to women beneficiaries should not be a challenging feat.Economists do believe that if the government’s per capita expenditure is one rupee, its effect on economy will be nearly five times in form of a ‘multiplier effect’. Thus the annual financial benefit of Rs 10,000 to eligible woman under Subhadra scheme will have multiplier effect of generating Rs 50,000 per woman on the economy. Thus, the total earmarked expenditure of Rs 55,825 crore under the scheme in five years, will accrue the benefits of nearly 2.5 lakh crore to the state’s economy while nudging women towards economic independence and a vastly improved life for the family. Here, the scheme symbolises more than financial assistance; it represents a transformative opportunity for women to assert their rightful roles in society and contribute to the country’s advancement.Considering the plight of women of Odisha and their continued neglect over decades, PM Modi made a solemn pledge to Odisha’s mothers and sisters to work for their uplift and empowerment. Subhadra scheme is an outcome of the solemn promise made to Odisha’s women and it unmistakably echoes a larger women empowerment narrative driven by PM Modi.Subhadra is more than a scheme; it is an expression of Modi government’s philosophy. As the PM himself has said, “Dreams of India will only come true when its daughters can soar as high as its sons.” This belief forms the cornerstone of the reformist agenda of the government that has defined his leadership.Today, women empowerment is at the centre of the government’s policy focus. Women are no longer just passive beneficiaries of welfare schemes but active participants in the nation’s growth story. From Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which has empowered millions of women to access financial services, to Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which liberated them from the drudgery of smoky kitchens, to MUDRA Yojana, which has supported women in pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams, Centre’s policies have consistently demonstrated an acute awareness of the women’s issues and the need for their financial independence. Not surprisingly, women have responded with overwhelming support giving our government a historic third term in a row.True empowerment comes when women are not just recipients of benefits but leaders in driving change. The shift from ‘women’s develop ment’ to ‘women-led development’ is a testament to this fact. Initiatives like Lakhpati Didi Yojana, which seeks to empower three crore women through self-help groups, providing drones through central financial assistance to 15,000 women SHGs in various states, MUDRA loan enhancement to women entrepreneurs and many other schemes demonstrate a clear and consistent focus on women empowerment. Nari Shakti is no longer a distant ideal; it is the very engine that powers India’s development story. PM Modi spearheaded Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, 2023, paving the way for women’s political empowerment by way of reserving one-third seats for women in Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies.Today, we honour the remarkable strength and resilience of women as they navi gate unchartered territories, breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings along the way. Initiatives such as the Subhadra scheme not only redefine the future of Odisha but also pave the way for an India where every woman can dream, thrive, and lead with confidence. As the PM dedicates this transformative initiative to the women of Odisha, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering a society where women stand shoulder to shoulder with men, sharing equal opportunities and responsibilities. Odisha’s Subhadra scheme represents just one pivotal step in an ongoing journey toward women-led development — a journey integral to the vision of both a Viksit Odisha and a Viksit Bharat.","The Subhadra scheme promises annual financial assistance of Rs 10,000 for eligible women beneficiaries aged between 21 and 60.

Like Caesar's wife, an investigating agency must be above board. Not long ago, this court castigated CBI comparing it to a caged parrot. It is imperative that CBI dispels the notion of it being a caged parrot.

BHOPAL: Cheetahs were not part of the Kuno management plan , stated a MP govt audit report, pointing out violation of rules and absence of certain documents related to expenditures on Project Cheetah .Kuno was marked for the relocation of Gir lions and was designated as their secondary habitat, but there was no movement on that front, the report said.Auditors sent a detailed report to state govt, outright rejecting some explanations given by the forest department. Copies of the initial audit findings were obtained through RTI by activist Ajay Dubey who has demanded a probe into the objections raised by financial investigators.According to the approved management plan for Kuno National Park (2020-21 to 2029-30), the sanctuary was designated as a crucial secondary habitat for Asiatic lions - alongside Gir forest in Gujarat - auditors noted, pointing out that no efforts had been made towards reintroduction of lions as of Nov 2023. This lapse raises questions about adherence to the management plan and the overall effectiveness of conservation efforts, they said.The auditors also noted the absence of reports from a three-member expert team appointed by Supreme Court on Jan 28, 2020. These reports were not found in the forest division's records, preventing verification of the facts presented to SC, stated the audit report.The expenditure of over Rs 44.1 crore on Project Cheetah from 2021-22 to 2023-24 did not align with the approved management plan, it said. ""This discrepancy suggests misallocation of funds and raises concerns about the proper use of financial resources,"" added Dubey.The auditors found that the forest division failed to conduct physical verification of store materials for 2021-22 and 2022-23 fiscals, violating Rule 133 of MP Financial Code. The required certification for physical verification was missing, and stock accounts had not been prepared, which is a serious breach of regulations.The audit also identified that geotagged photographs, which are required to document project work, were not maintained. This lack of documentation, combined with the expenditure of Rs 3,64,74,930 on pasture development and weed/latana eradication in 2020-21, 2022-23, and 2023-24, suggests a ""faulty procedure and potential for wastage"".In response, the forest division has pledged to address these issues by preparing the missing stock accounts and ensuring future compliance with documentation requirements. However, the auditors have recommended that the matter be brought to the attention of higher officials for further action.","Auditors sent a detailed report to state govt, outright rejecting some explanations given by the forest department.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Enforcement Directorate has initiated an investigation under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against illegal infiltration of Bangladeshis and Rohingya in Jharkhand, reported.The enforcement agency's ECIR (enforcement case information report) under PMLA is based on an FIR of Ranchi police (registered at Bariyatu PS on June 6) but it will look into the larger conspiracy, including the gains from infiltration being deployed into politics.The decision of the enforcement agency - primarily tasked to administer the anti-money laundering regime and violations of FEMA - coincides with alleged infiltration from Bangladesh emerging as one of the key issues in the campaign for Jharkhand polls.Speaking at a Jamshedpur rally in poll-bound Jharkhand on Sunday, PM Modi had blamed the coalition of JMM, Congress and RJD for change of demography in Santhal Parganas and Kolhan by allegedly facilitating infiltration of Rohingya and Bangladeshis. Jharkhand police 's FIR is related to trafficking of six girls from Bangladesh to Jharkhand. The girls, Rohingya and Bangladeshis in their 20s, were nabbed during a raid by police. Subsequent investigation showed they had obtained identity papers and Aadhaar cards in Hindu names based on fake documents arranged by agents from Kolkata.The agency has already gathered details from other central agencies related to the operation of the syndicate engaged in trafficking Bangladeshis and Rohingya through forests in Jharkhand. A well organised network operating out of Kolkata is engaged in forging documents to help the alleged infiltrators pass themselves off as Indians from Bengal, sources said.""A large syndicate is operating across Jharkhand and Bengal in illegal infiltration, making fake identity proof, which are criminal activities linked to proceeds of crime under Section 2(1)(u) of PMLA,"" a source said, adding it was necessary to investigate illegal infiltration from Bangladesh and the agents facilitating such activities, which are aimed at acquiring proceeds of crime. The agency will conduct an exhaustive money trail probe of the entire trafficking network.CM Hemant Soren's assembly constituency, Barhait in Sahibganj, is part of the region where the number of alleged Bangladeshis and Rohingya has increased. Blaming it on vote-bank politics, Modi said, ""JMM, Congress and RJD are standing with Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants . They want to create votebanks in the name of religion.

In her plea, she said she had met with an accident two days prior and was unable to walk.A division bench of Justices G S Kulkarni and Somasekhar Sundaresan, in its Sept 12 order, said Lamya Khurshid Siddiqui has an excellent academic record and had scored 98% in the national level entrance test conducted for this course.It would be necessary to recognise the petitioner's merit and not let her opportunity to secure admission suffer for the sheer inability to attend an in-person meeting, the HC observed. The bench took note of the fact that two other students who had informed MU of their inability to attend the session due to medical issues were permitted to send a representative with all necessary documents and they were given provisional admission.Noting that Siddiqui has suffered an apparent injustice solely due to her inability to attend the counselling session, the bench said it was persuaded to grant relief on the basic consideration that the two supernumerary seats would remain unutilised.

"For disabled aspirants, new clause crushes hopes of nursing career",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-disabled-aspirants-new-clause-crushes-hopes-of-nursing-career/articleshow/113407838.cms,"● Krishna (uses only her first name) retired as deputy nursing superintendent in 2022 after being a nurse for more than 30 years. She lost both her legs in an accident just as she was graduating in nursing but went on to join GTB Hospital in East Delhi in 1989 using a wheelchair to move around.

● Lokesh* whose right leg was affected by polio since childhood was certified as having 65% disability. However, he has been working as an assistant nursing superintendent in AIIMS Bhopal.

● Meeta*, who has 100% hearing loss in one ear, has been working as a nurse since 2011 in a Delhi govt hospital.She says that she has never faced any problem in carrying out her duties because of her disability but was told that since deafness was not a recognised disability in nursing, she could not avail benefits of the quota for people with disabilities.While examples like Krishna, Meeta and Lokesh show that nurses with disabilities can indeed work in hospitals and may, in fact, show more understanding to patients, hurdles to a nursing career have only increased for other disabled aspirants .Recently, a girl with an amputated arm, whose disability level was 51%, was not allowed to join a BSc Nursing course because the Indian Nursing Council (INC) does not let anyone with a disability level above 50% take admission in nursing courses .Ranveer Singh Chauhan, president of the Differently Abled Employees Welfare Association, says there are about 200 nurses with various levels and kinds of disabilities working in several govt hospitals in Delhi. “Among them are some who have been certified as having 70%-80% disability. This cut-off of 50% is ridiculous,” says Chauhan, who works as an assistant nursing superintendent in the Central Jail Hospital, Tihar. He does not know the exact percentage of his disability since there was no such rule to determine the exact percentage before 2016. It was enough that a person’s disability was above 40% to avail of the quota for persons with disability.In 2020, INC revised the BSc (Nursing) curriculum for the first time since Independence. Now, its clause 8 states that only those “with a disability of locomotor to the tune of 40% to 50% of the lower extremity” would be eligible for graduation in nursing. This excludes candidates with other disabilities such as muscular dystrophy, dwarfism, acid attack victims, low vision, hearing impairment, speech disability and intellectual disability. Despite so many senior nurses with varying levels of disabilities working in Delhi, none of them were invited to be part of framing the regulations.Even after Delhi high court directed INC to re-evaluate the criteria, it reiterated that its high-powered committee had considered all issues and upheld the clause, saying that limited functional abilities of nurses would hamper care. “Nursing care activities mandate physical and mental fitness like good vision, hearing and stamina for assisting patients in activities of daily living,” it argued.Krishna pointed out that she and several others were proof that even with substantial disability one could contribute as a nurse. “I liked being posted in the injection room where hundreds of people had to be given injections which I could do sitting down. I was also in charge of the stores and keeping track of medicines and supplies. I drive a scooty and do all the work in my house on my own including sweeping, mopping and cooking. We deserve to be given a chance to work and earn a living and lead independent lives,” she says.The National Organization of Nurses with Disabilities (NOND) of the US wrote to the INC urging the council to “open the educational doors to students with disabilities” pointing out that nurses with disabilities or chronic health conditions “can provide competent, empathetic, direct patient care, or work in other healthcare industry sectors for corporations and nonprofit organisations”. The NOND letter listed several careers other than clinical nursing, such as becoming disabled nurse educators, consulting on health and wellness, private duty, rehabilitation etc.Doctors With Disabilities : Agents of Change, which filed the public interest petition in the Delhi high court, says it places “artificial fetters at the stage of admission itself, reducing the chances of persons with disabilities from being suitably employed.” This, when India faces a significant shortfall of nursing staff. It has 1.96 nurses per 1,000 people against the WHO-recommended ratio of three nurses.Dr Satendra Singh, a disability rights activist and faculty in GTB Hospital Delhi, points out that the disabled find unconventional ways to adapt to. “Why only nurses who are ‘one-legged’ or with ‘both legs disabled’? We need compassionate nurses who understand what it is like to live with chronic illness or disability, not superhuman robots. To clear misconceptions about the capacity of students with disabilities to undergo training in nursing, why doesn’t INC include nurses with disabilities in the committees that frame such regulations?” he says.*Name changed on request","A girl with an amputated arm, whose disability level was 51%, was not allowed to join a BSc Nursing course.

He was arrested and sent to an observation home, but broke out in Nov 2019, while his criminal appeal was still being heard in HC. Justice Abhyankar observed: ""Looking at the overwhelming medical evidence in the present case, it does not take an expert to see as to how demonic the appellant's conduct was while he was juvenile, and his mindset can also be gathered from the fact that he has also absconded from the observation home, and presently is at large, probably lurking in some dark corner of the street, for yet another prey, and there is nobody to stop him.""""And, although such voices are being raised time and again by the Constitutional Courts of this country, to the utter dismay of the victims, they have not been able to make any impact on the legislature even after a decade of Nirbhaya which took place in 2012,"" he added.","Justice Subodh Abhyankar made the observation on September 11, while dismissing a criminal appeal of a rape offender.
