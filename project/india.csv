"Rae Bareli, Amethi saw higher turnout of women than men",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rae-bareli-amethi-saw-higher-turnout-of-women-than-men/articleshow/110411702.cms,"LUCKNOW: Higher number of women voted than men in much talked-about constituencies Rae Bareli and Amethi which went to the polls in the fifth phase on May 20. These are the only two constituencies, out of 53 which have voted so far in the state, where the absolute number of women who came to vote is more than men.According to voter turnout data accessed exclusively by TOI, 5,23,822 females stepped out to vote on May 20 as compared to 5,13,167 males in Rae Bareli, while in Amethi, 4,92,861 women voted as compared to 4,83,188 men.When further analyzed, it was found that 61.42 per cent women exercised their franchise in Rae Bareli, which was 58.1 per cent in 2019, while in Amethi 57.74 per cent women voter turnout was registered against the 56.4 per cent in 2019.Rae Bareli’s total voter turnout on May 20 was 58.12 per cent (only votes via EVMs), while in 2019 it was 56.12 per cent (only votes via EVMs). With postal ballots, the turnout was 56.34 per cent in 2019.Similarly, in Amethi, the turnout on May 20 was 54.34 per cent (only votes via EVMs), while in 2019 it was 53.97 per cent (only votes via EVMs). With postal ballots, the turnout was 54.1 per cent .As per the ECI, in 2019, out of 80 parliamentary constituencies, 37 had registered higher women turnout than men in terms of percentage, but in absolute numbers, only six constituencies -- Maharajganj, Sultanpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Domariyaganj and reserved seats Machhlishahr and Lalganj -- saw higher turnout of female voters.Speaking to TOI, political analyst and veteran scribe JP Shukla said, “It can be assumed that central government schemes focused on women, and political factors of BJP’s Smriti Irani and Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi in the poll campaign attracted more women voters to polling booths.”However, Anand Vardhan Singh, another political analyst and veteran journalist said, “If central government schemes for women was the reason for higher women turnout in Rae Bareli and Amethi, then by the same logic, the women should have come out more in numbers in the remaining 51 constituencies which went to the polls.”“We can agree that both Smriti Irani and Priyanka Gandhi along with Sonia Gandhi managed to pull out more women in poll campaigns which resulted in such large women participation in voting,” he added.Meanwhile, Professor Badri Narayan of G B Pant Social Science Institute, Allahabad, said, “Another factor why large numbers of parliamentary constituencies didn’t register more women participation as compared to 2019 is possibly a belief that the Modi government had a higher chance to repeat, so why step out to vote. But this is just an assumption.”“One cannot ignore that the star women campaigner from both BJP (Smriti) and Congress (Priyanka) made immense contributions in attracting the women voters,” he added.According to ECI, the highest voter turnout in numbers was recorded in Ghaziabad (14.69 lakh) and GB Nagar (14.34 lakh).","Rae Bareli and Amethi are the only two constituencies, out of 53 which have voted so far in the state, where the absolute number of women who came to vote is more than men. 5,23,822 females stepped out to vote on May 20 as compared to 5,13,167 males in Rae Bareli.

Dynamic duo or desperate move?

Rivals in Punjab, friends in Delhi

NEW DELHI: Delhi is casting votes today in the sixth phase to elect seven candidates to the Lok Sabha. The BJP, which won all seven seats in both the 2014 and 2019 elections, is confident of another victory in the national capital. In a bid to break BJP's winning streak, its rivals Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP and the Congress, which contested separately in the previous polls, have joined forces. However, the data shows that even their combined might may not be enough to defeat the BJP in most of the seats.Once rivals, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party reached a seat-sharing agreement in late February after weeks of political conflict and deliberation. Both parties acknowledged their shared goal of defeating the PM Modi-led BJP and recognized the strategic advantage of their alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. However, the perception that AAP went back on its stance by partnering with a party it vehemently opposed during its inception is intensifying its existing challenges.In the 2014 general elections, the combined votes of Congress and AAP in six of the seven seats in Delhi outnumbered those of the BJP. However, by 2019, the BJP managed to secure more votes than the combined tally of the two parties in all seven seats. As the BJP was far ahead of both the parties individually in both the elections, a united front was the only way that the parties could potentially alter the electoral dynamics.In the 2019 general elections, the BJP secured 57% of the vote, Congress garnered 23%, AAP received 18%, and other parties accounted for 2%. In contrast, the 2020 state elections saw AAP’s vote share surging to 54%, Congress' vote share dropping to 4%, while the BJP received 39% and other parties remained at 3%. This stark variation in vote percentages within just a year is what the opposition parties are banking upon for the upcoming polls.From the outset, the alliance between AAP and Congress displayed visible fissures. However, Kejriwal’s arrest in connection with the liquor policy case gave the opposition parties a moment to show signs of unity in the otherwise broken INDIA bloc.Initially, many Delhi Congress leaders, including Arvinder Singh Lovely (who eventually resigned and joined the BJP), opposed the partnership. Now, however, this alliance is viewed more favorably, with Congress candidates hoping to garner sympathy and support after the Delhi chief minister's arrest.In the 2024 general elections, the AAP will contest on four seats: East Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi, and New Delhi. The Congress will contest on the remaining three seats: Chandni Chowk, North East Delhi, and North West Delhi.AAP, which emerged as a formidable political force in Delhi, did so largely at the expense of Congress. In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, AAP’s vote share surged to 54.3% from 29.5% in 2013, while Congress saw its vote share plummet from 24.5% to less than 10%. The trend continued in the 2020 Assembly polls, where Congress' vote share dipped further, suggesting that AAP’s support base largely comprised former Congress voters. The alliance with AAP offers Congress a lifeline in Delhi offering it an opportunity to regain some of its lost ground and increase its influence in the capital.For AAP, the alliance is crucial to maintain its political relevance on the national stage. AAP emerged as a significant opposition to the BJP in the 2014 elections. AAP at 32.90% vote share was just behind the BJP which had polled 46.40% votes. However, its voter base declined in 2019, with Congress seeing an uptick in its vote share. This shift suggested that while AAP was initially perceived as a viable alternative to the BJP, this perception weakened over time. By aligning with Congress, AAP hopes to consolidate anti-BJP votes and enhance its prospects in the 2024 general elections.Ironically, despite forming an alliance in Delhi, AAP and Congress remain political rivals in Punjab. Confident in their prospects in Punjab, they have chosen not to collaborate there. However, facing the BJP's stronghold in Delhi, they have decided to unite, recognising their individual weaknesses in the capital.The Congress-AAP alliance under the INDIA bloc is a move aimed at dethroning the BJP in Delhi. While the combined strength of the two parties offers a glimmer of hope for a formidable challenge, the success of this alliance will depend on their ability to effectively mobilize their voter bases, address internal dissent, and present a cohesive front against the BJP.","Delhi is casting votes today in the sixth phase to elect seven candidates to the Lok Sabha.

Caste Combinations

Once Battleground Of The Stalwarts

SHRAVASTI: From being the home of Anathapindika, the richest donor for Gautam Buddha who, according to a legend, covered Jetavana with leaves of gold to buy it and offer it to the Enlightened One as his resting place, to being one of India’s poorest districts, Shravasti has seen much. Listed as one of the aspirational districts of the NITI Aayog’s poverty alleviation programme, Shravasti along with its poor neighbours, Bahraich and Balrampur districts, forms one of the country’s most deprived blocks where much is planned to be done.Shravasti is one of the very few districts in India which don’t have a railway station of their own. The nearest station here is Payagpur in the neighbouring Bahraich district.The promise of setting up industries here and providing job opportunities to the local youth is the main poll pitch of both the incumbent MP and his challenger.Interestingly, like Anathapindika, who was an industrialist and a banker, the two main Lok Sabha contenders here are BJP’s Saket Mishra, a former banker, and sitting MP and INDIA bloc’s candidate Ram Shiromani Verma, an industrialist.Verma who had barely managed to scrape past BJP’s Daddan Mishra in 2019 with a margin of 5,320 votes, faces both anti-incumbency and a challenger with a pedigree. Saket is the son of Nripendra Mishra, the chairperson of Ram Mandir Construction Committee and former principal secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Saket’s maternal grandfather Pt Badluram Shukla, a freedom fighter, had represented Bahraich Lok Sabha in the 1970s as a Congress candidate.Saket, who was nominated by UP governor as an MLC in 2023, has worked in the region for a few years now. In 2019, he was appointed advisor to Purvanchal Vikas Board, to provide ideas for the holistic development of eastern Uttar Pradesh. In an interview to PTI, he recently said that he plans to improve the health, industry and education sectors in Shravasti and its neighbouring districts.Saket, who opted out of Indian Police Services after clearing the exam in 1994, to work as an investment banker says he will use his contacts in the industry to bring employment opportunities for the youths of the districts.For the voters in the region, development, employment opportunities and assurance of basic facilities remain top on the poll agenda.“Despite being such an important place of both Buddhism and Jainism, along with being a place of great interest in Southeast Asia, none of the political parties have shown interest in the region or done any development here,” said Manish Rawat who owns a small food kiosk in Katra. “We are yet to get an MP who really cares about the place,” he said. Prodded a bit more, he says Saket Mishra seems earnest.Kiran Yadav, a BA student who has to travel to Gonda to catch a train whenever she has to take an examination in Delhi or Lucknow, says, “Even after being an important district, there are no railway lines here.”“I become an object of curiosity among my friends elsewhere when I tell them that my district doesn't have a railway station of its own,” she adds.A government school teacher, Sachin Tiwari, in Motipur Barahwa village, said that the district has immense potential to generate employment and be turned into a major tourist hub, but so far, no candidate has shown an interest in it.Savita Singh, from Gopalpur village in Ikauna tehsil who runs an NGO, says that her vote is for the candidate who establishes a good medical college in the region. “Even the primary health centres and community health centres lack basic facilities,” she adds.Kartavya Kumar, who owns a small dhaba on Shravasti-Barabanki highway, believes that the NDA government paid some attention to the district.“An airport was inaugurated in Shravasti in February. Additionally, the foundation stone for a state university, dedicated to Maa Pateshwari Devi, was laid in Balrampur. Infrastructure projects, including the commencement of work on Ring Road, are underway. Underpasses and roads have been widened,” he says.Until 2008, it was known as Balrampur Lok Sabha constituency. The political history of this place, prior to Independence, has seen a confrontation between Hindu Mahasabha and pro-Pakistan voices in Balrampur. After the Partition, Balrampur estate was led by Rajputs/Thakurs which led to their rivalry with the Brahmins.Since its first Lok Sabha election in 2009, it has given MPs from three different parties. In 2009, the seat was won by Vinay Pandey of Congress. In 2014, BJP’s Daddan Mishra won, and then in 2019, SP-BSP joint candidate Ram Shiromani Verma won with a margin of just 5,320 votes. Interestingly, NOTA count of 17,108 votes was way more than the winning margin. This time, BJP’s Saket Mishra, a Brahmin, is pitted against SP’s Verma, a Kurmi.Interestingly, the sitting MP was also expelled by the BSP for indiscipline weeks before the polls began.The BSP has given a ticket to Muinuddin Ahmad Khan, who has a Gangsters Act case against him.Shravasti has around 30.79% Muslim population. While it has 68.79% Hindu population, which includes 17% Dalits, 10% Kurmis, 8% each Yadavs and Brahmins, 7% Kshatriyas, 6% Vaishyas, 2% STs and others. Under the Shravasti Lok Sabha, there are five assembly segments – Tulsipur, Gainsar, Balrampur, Bhinga and Shravasti.First three segments come under Balrampur district and other two fall under Shravasti district.In 17 general elections here, only four Muslims have been elected. These Muslims belonged to the upper caste.The politics here remains dominated by Hindu upper castes. Thakurs won this seat four times and Brahmins eight times. In the political contest, Indian National Congress (INC) has won the Lok Sabha seat six times and BJP seven times. SP has won it twice, while BSP once.Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee started his political journey from the seat. Another right-wing stalwart and social reformer Nanaji Deshmukh represented Balrampur in Lok Sabha in 1971-1979). Deshmukh, who was awarded Bharat Ratna in 2019, played an important role in carrying out a social restructuring programme in over 500 villages of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. He established the country’s first Saraswati Sishu Mandir at Gorakhpur in 1950 and was the founder of Deendayal Research Institute situated at Chitrakoot. Freedom fighter and Congress leader Subhadra Joshi, who took part in Quit India movement, represented Balrampur in 1962. As a parliamentarian, she made an outstanding contribution to the passage of the Special Marriage Act, the Nationalization of Banks, Abolition of Privy Purses, Aligarh University Amendment Act and others.Mohammed Hasan, former gram pradhan of Mahdewa village in Bhinga tehsil, says that he had heard from his grandfather how their village had collected funds when Atal Bihari Vajpayee had contested polls from this constituency, then known as Balrampur LS seat, in 1957. It was Vajpayee’s first stint with politics. “He used to eat food at the house of common people here, irrespective of caste and religion, and interacted with each one. He lost in 1962 from the seat against Congress’s Subhadra Joshi, but even then, used to come and visit us. We are yet to see such a candidate again. We again voted for him in 1967 when he won,” says Hasan.",Shravasti is one of the very few districts in India which don’t have a railway station of their own. The nearest station here is Payagpur in the neighbouring Bahraich district. The promise of setting up industries here and providing job opportunities to the local youth is the main poll pitch of both the incumbent MP and his challenger.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110411981,imgsize-294974,width-400,resizemode-4/110411981.jpg"

He added that BJP leaders were advised to visit constituencies the party hadn't won in 2019, and look into what changes need to be made and what needs to be done for winning those seats.""This is the BJP you are talking about. There is a kind of process, an exercise out of which an outcome is produced...we had done this exercise, which were the seats we did not win in the 2019 election, what should we do to try and win those seats?

From becoming an IPS officer to leading international banking operations at the Royal Bank of Scotland, what inspired your transition to

politics

?

What approach do you use to appeal to voters? In 2018, Niti Aayog identified Shravasti as one of the most poverty-stricken areas of the country. How do you plan to address this issue?

You are facing a former MP from the Samajwadi Party. How do you assess your chances in the elections?

Does your college friend Asim Arun, now a minister, provide you with insights and feedback now that you have entered politics?

What is your perspective on the possibility of BJP achieving the target of 400 seats?

With a notable legacy from your father, do you believe it has been advantageous to your political journey?

What are your views on AI and Machine learning?

Other than PM Modi, whom do you admire as a politician? What are your interests other than politics?

A seasoned professional with experience across sectors, including international stints, MLChas jumped into the electoral fray as BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate from Shravasti. Son of the former bureaucrat and chairman of Ram Temple Construction Committee Nripendra Mishra, Saket firmly believes that a dedicated politician can catalyze significant change in his/her constituency. In conversation with, he spoke on the issues facing Shravasti and his vision for development . Excerpts:Politics is all about social service. I have served across sectors, and now I want to contribute to the development of the poor and backward areas of India. Upon my return, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji entrusted me with the task of overseeing the development of backward areas in east UP, which naturally led me towards politics. The party recognized my work and considered me for this role. Unlike in bureaucracy, there is no concern for promotion in politics. A good politician can make a significant difference in his area, unhindered by institutional constraints. At this stage of life, I am not seeking promotions. I am focused on serving the people. My party has been very supportive during this transition. Comfort is not a concern to me. When I was in Singapore, I walked through the deepest areas of eastern UP wearing backpacks during work. The culture within the party, fostered by PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi, emphasizes bringing individuals like me into politics, individuals who have the mindset of serving the people.I have already devised a strategy focusing on two fundamental issues – health and education. I aim to streamline health facilities to make them more accessible to the people, who often face challenges in accessing healthcare services. I am also working on implementing an education policy that ensures that children receive quality education and can compete globally. I plan to attract industries to generate employment opportunities. I aim to establish standard service levels to ensure that the poor receive essential facilities promptly, such as income proof and property rights. Many people are unaware of their rights, and we need to change that. Government services must be provided efficiently, and officials should be held accountable if they fail to deliver.Works done by the double-engine govt will speak for itself. I believe in the power of comparison. People will evaluate the work done over the past 7-8 years by me through the CSR fund and the work done by their elected representatives. No candidate can be compared to PM Modi , who empathizes with the poor and understands their needs. He is a ‘ yugpurush ’. For me, the real issue is whether my efforts are truly improving the lives of the people and if I can connect with them on a personal level.Yes. Asim and his wife have been a constant source of support. They offer valuable feedback and insights. Not just him, even Shashi Tharoor and Amar Patnaik provide inputs. Our college has a history of producing idealistic individuals, which has been beneficial.I believe we will get widespread support, although I cannot predict the exact numbers. The PM has captured the hearts of the people like no other leader post-independence. The opposition is envious of Modi, it only thinks about its interests. The PM focuses on the nation’s development. People understand that only he can lead the country to greater heights.My father’s legacy certainly helped amplify my voice. However, it also comes with the responsibility to uphold a fair and efficient govt. The path to doing the right thing is often challenging, but if I can achieve even half of what my father accomplished, it would be a significant achievement. My experiences abroad have taught me to rise above the shadow of my father and work towards the betterment of society.If elected, I would urge the PM to establish a committee to implement AI and machine learning in the country’s school curriculum.

It is such a small thing,” she told ANI. “The way they have beaten me, ab chaahe duniya ki koi bhi shakti lag jaye main resign nahi karungi (now they can try as hard as they want, I will not resign). I have been told that this is the reason my character is being assassinated. I will not resign. I am the youngest women Parliamentarian right now and I will work very hard and will become an ideal.""Narrating the sequence of events, Maliwal alleged that when she was waiting in the drawing room of CM's residence, Bibhav Kumar came towards her aggressively. She told him that she waiting for CM. ""…He started shouting at me, saying things like ‘how dare you refuse us, we will teach you a lesson’ and ‘what do you think of yourself’ and started hurling abuses and called me a 'neech aurat' (vile woman)...He slapped me 7-8 times....I was screaming and begging for help, but no one came forward,"" Maliwal alleged.On Kumar Maliwal said, “He is not an ordinary PA. He is a very resourceful and powerful man in the party and the whole party is fearful of him. His house is more luxurious than any minister’s... There is already an assault case against him."" She added, “There is a messaging in the party that if Kumar gets angry with you, then you are finished in this party.”She said: “I have always gone like that to his house and I was clueless that something like this would happen with me. For 20 years I know him... I go to his house and he comes to our house...” Asked about whether she feels betrayed by the fact that Sunita Kejriwal or Atishi were not supporting her, Maliwal expressed extreme dismay at minister Atishi, alleging that they were “victim-shaming” her, while drawing parallels with the alleged victim-shaming faced by Nirbhaya.“I feel that there could be no worse victim shaming than this. The sad part is that a woman minister of Delhi has said that look, her clothes are not torn, look, there are no wounds on her head. That was all left to do maybe, should have got it also done,” she said. “...When did I say in the FIR that my clothes were torn, when did I say in the FIR that my head was wounded... I wrote exactly what happened to me, word for word. And if I am wrong then I am ready to undergo polygraph test. Everything will be clear then,” she said. She alleged that she had been totally isolated by the party and appealed for a “free and fair investigation” by Delhi Police.","Swati Maliwal says she has learnt that efforts at her character assassination and victim-shaming have been made because her party wants her to resign. “If they needed my Rajya Sabha seat, they could have asked for it politely, I would have given my life.

'International Khan Market gang': Jaishankar on Western media's portrayal of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/international-khan-market-gang-jaishankar-on-western-medias-portrayal-of-india/articleshow/110402600.cms,"'Countries Going To Court For Polls...': Jaishankar Slams Western Media Over 2024 Elections Coverage

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar slammed the Western media and called the anti-India ecosystem the 'international Khan Market gang '. On the portrayal of India by the Western media, Jaishankar said we must ask ""why they are doing it"". He said that just like there's a 'Khan Market gang' in India, there also exists a global extension of it, 'international Khan Market gang'.""In the country today, there is a certain thought process, or entitlement process for which the metaphor of 'Khan Market gang' is a very good description.I want to tell you there is an international Khan Market gang as well,"" Jaishankar said in an interview to news agency ANI.""These are people who are sort of linked, you know, to the entitled people out here. They are socially comfortable with them. They know them. They feel like they advance similar viewpoints. They are essentially a kind of an elitist left-lib thought process. So there's a symbiotic relationship between the two,"" he said.Talking about how they openly endorse leaders and parties , he said, ""When the sales are down in the domestic Khan Market, the International Khan Market gang feels like, I need to pep up these guys and give them support and you can actually see which stories they play up, how do they slant things and in previous elections perhaps even in this one they've actually openly endorsed parties and will openly endorse leaders and openly said that this party or this leader is bad for India.""Jaishankar also claimed that attempt is being made to influence the choices of voters. ""I believe it is election influence certainly...And it's not just them, you know, there's a... See, it's a... press, university, think tank, and in some cases maybe some degree of officialdom at some kind of medium level because the guys up there are very smart. They don't get into this. So there is a very clear attempt being made, a very persistent attempt being made to actually influence the direction of Indian politics and the choices of the Indian voter,"" he said.Asked if his ministry gets riled up over editorials, Jaishankar said it is their job to contest, convince and communicate. ""I don't think we get riled up. But it is our job to contest, to convince and where necessary to communicate. If somebody, some newspaper or some medium whatever you know has a narrative and that narrative is unfair, if that narrative is untruthful, and we often encounter this, if it is very, very slanted, I do not think we should hesitate to call it out,"" he said."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar slammed the Western media and called the anti-India ecosystem the 'international Khan Market gang' He said we must ask ""why they are doing it"" Jaishanksar also claimed that attempt is being made to influence the choices of voters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110402644,imgsize-1638513,width-400,resizemode-4/110402644.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Two officials from the Yerawada police station in Pune have been suspended on Friday for neglecting their duties related to the Porsche car crash incident, officials said. The crash, which involved a minor driving the vehicle resulted in the death of two software professionals on May 19 in the Kalyani Nagar area of the city.""Police Inspector (PI) Rahul Jagdale and Assistant Police Inspector (API), Vishwanath Todkari, posted at Yerwada police station, have been suspended as they did not inform the wireless control room about the accident"" said Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar.According to additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil, the suspended officials were found to have reported the incident late and failed to perform their duties adequately.Amitesh Kumar had earlier stated that attempts were made to make it appear that the minor was not driving the car at the time of the accident.Kumar had also said that an internal inquiry revealed lapses on the part of the police officials while registering the case.He confirmed there was a delay in collecting the blood samples of the juvenile, who was suspected of consuming alcohol at two pubs before the accident. The accident occurred around 3 am on Sunday, but the blood samples were only collected at 11 pm, as per the commissioner's statement.Further details regarding the specific circumstances surrounding the officers' misconduct have not been disclosed at this time.A court in Pune on Friday sent Vishal Agarwal, the father of a 17-year-old involved in a fatal car crash and five other accused to judicial custody until June 7.The prosecution sought an extension of their police custody for further investigation, but the court decided to remand them in judicial custody instead.","Two officials from the Yerawada police station in Pune have been suspended on Friday for neglecting their duties related to the Porsche car crash incident.

How 'mystery of lost key' has spiced up Odisha elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-mystery-of-lost-key-has-spiced-up-odisha-elections/articleshow/110397512.cms,"NEW DELHI: When most of the top opposition leaders flew to Bihar last year to present a 'formidable front' against the ever-strong Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik was one of the few big faces missing at the Patna meeting, which saw the birth of the INDIA bloc.A month before the June 2023 Patna meeting, Patnaik had made it clear that he would go solo in the upcoming elections, calling it a 'principle' of his party, Biju Janata Dal ( BJD ).Two months later in August, Patnaik's BJD backed Centre's Delhi Services Bill and also voted against the no-confidence motion moved by the INDIA bloc against the Modi government in Rajya Sabha, where the BJP lacks majority of its own.With Patnaik backing the BJP-led NDA, the INDIA bloc was dealt a heavy blow in Parliament as it failed to stop the Delhi Services Bill, marking defeat in a battle that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had said was a ""semi-final"" before the 2024 parliamentary polls.Next month in September, the BJD chief rated PM Modi 's government ""8 out of 10"", and appreciated the Prime Minister for the Centre's foreign policy and its action against corruption.After CM Naveen Patnaik's 'ratings' remarks, rumours began to build up that the old buddies (BJP and BJD) could tie up in the run-up to the summer elections. The speculation gained immense traction when PM Modi, just a month before polls, called Naveen Patnaik a 'popular' CM.However, as often happens in politics -- popular rumours got scotched as BJP and BJD decided to go solo in Odisha, which witnesses simultaneous assembly and parliamentary elections.PM Modi began his campaign trail in Odisha on May 6 and addressed a poll rally in Nabarangpur and Berhampur.The Prime Minister initially pulled his punches as he made no mention of CM Patnaik. He, however, did attack the state government by mentioning BJD -- the PM named BJD 15 times in his two speeches.In the following rallies, the PM launched a stronger attack, making a broad claim that June 4 would be the expiry date of the BJD government in Odisha and that the BJP would announce the CM face on the same day.Naveen Patnaik dismissed the PM's assertions as 'daydreaming'.The first exchange of words between PM Modi and CM Patnaik again threw up speculations that the BJP is in a friendly fight with the BJD in the coastal state.Again, the rumours were short-lived as the campaign was about to spice up!During his second visit to Odisha, PM Modi took Naveen Patnaik's name for the first time in the Khandamal poll rally and launched a blistering attack at him while raking up one of the most emotive issues of the state -- 'mystery keys' of Mahaprabhu Jagannath temple's inner chamber. PM's direct attack on Naveen Patnaik came just two days before the state was to vote on May 13.“I want to draw your attention to a sensitive issue. 7 decades ago, rules were established for the management of the Shri Jagannath Temple. Among these rules was the maintenance of records for all temple assets, including gold, silver, and precious stones. The last evaluation of the treasure in Shri Ratna Bhandar took place 45 years ago, revealing an abundance of jewellery and gems deemed priceless. Surprisingly, the inner chamber keys of Shri Ratna Bhandar have been missing for the past six years,"" the PM said.""The state government claims to have found duplicate keys, but how and by whom they were made remains unknown. Despite handing over the investigation to a commission, the Odisha government has not made the report public. The BJP is committed to addressing this issue, and we ask, why is the BJD government avoiding it?” he added.“Why is the BJD government and Naveen Babu's government distancing itself from the issue? What compels the state government to hide the truth? Who are they trying to protect? Today, I promise the people of Odisha and the nation that under the BJP government, transparency and the reputation of Shri Ratna Bhandar will be restored. This is Modi Ki Guarantee,” PM Modi assured.PM's attack on Naveen Patnaik, on the emotive issue concerning Mahaprabhu Jagannath, ruffled BJD's feather.BJD refuted the PM's allegations over Shri Ratna Bhandar keys and said: ""PM probably doesn't know that the Ratna Bhandar of the Puri Jagannath Temple will be opened during Rath Yatra in July.""""No one has anything to hide in this matter,"" the ruling BJD said. While no clarification came from CM Naveen Patnaik on the whereabouts of the 'lost keys', his close aide VK Pandian recently said the PM is ""making a political statement so we (BJD) will take it like that"".Amid the row over the 'mystery of lost key', Naveen Patnaik seized the opportunity to lash out at the BJP when the party's Puri Lok Sabha candidate Sambit Patra said ""Mahaprabhu Jagannath is a devotee of PM Modi"", which he later clarified as a ""slip of the tongue"".""Lakhs of people have come to see Modi. Lord Jagannath is bhakt (devotee) of Modi and we all are members of Modi's family. I am unable to control my emotions at such an unprecedented sight. I feel it's a special day for all Odias,"" Sambit Patra had said.Though Patra apologised for his comment, it resulted in an outcry on social media. Naveen Patnaik, just a day before Odisha was to vote for its second phase, took to social media to condemn Patra's comment.""Mahaprabhu Shree Jagannatha is the Lord of Universe. Calling Mahaprabhu a bhakt of another human being is an insult to the Lord. This has hurt the sentiments and demeaned the faith of crores of Jagannatha bhaktas and Odias across the world,"" Naveen posted on X.The chief minister added, ""The Lord is the greatest Symbol of Odia Asmita. Calling Mahaprabhu a bhakt of another human being is totally condemnable. I strongly denounce the statement made by the BJP Puri Lok Sabha candidate and I appeal to the BJP to keep the Lord above any political discourse.""Facing backlash, Patra said: ""I wanted to say that Modi-ji is an ardent follower of Lord Jagannath. By mistake, I said that Jagannath is Modi's bhakt. There should be no politics on this matter. Quite naturally, we all are the devotees of Lord Jagannath,"" Patra wrote on X.With two phases of polling still due in the state, the fierce exchange of words between BJP and BJD over Mahaprabhu Jagannath and the 'mystery of the lost key' has spiced up the Odisha elections, which now seems to be less than a friendly match.","PM Modi began his campaign trail in Odisha on May 6 and addressed a poll rally in Nabarangpur and Berhampur.

The Hindi proverb is used for someone asking for trouble.The remark came during hearing of a plea by an NGO to publish the booth-wise numbers of voter turnout and upload copies of Form 17C (which reflects the votes polled in each polling station) on its website within 48 hours of polling.On poll body's voter turnout app which was launched to provide information on the estimated voter turnout for each state at parliamentary and assembly constituency level, the Supreme Court said the EC itself is asking for the trouble.""I had specifically asked him (EC counsel Maninder Singh) about the voter turnout app and whether there was any statutory requirement to upload data on a real time basis. To which he (Singh) replied that there are no such statutory requirements and ECI is doing so for fairness and transparency,"" Justice Datta said.""That day I did not say anything in open court but today I am willing to say something. It is like 'aa bail mujhe maar' (to invite trouble),"" he said referring to the criticism the EC is facing over its alleged reluctance to provide the full voter turnout data promptly in public domain.The bench, however, rejected the plea stating it would be challenging to arrange the necessary manpower at this stage, as five phases of polling have already been completed, with only two remaining.""We should also keep in mind the ground realities and not overburden the EC during the elections that too by changing the process mid-way,"" it said.(With PTI inputs)","The Supreme Court refused to direct the Election Commission of India ( EC ) to release voter turnout of each polling station on its website during Lok Sabha elections.

I can issue a stern warning to Prajwal and ask him to return from wherever he is and surrender before the police . He should subject himself to the legal process.

NEW DELHI: All seven Lok Sabha constituencies in Delhi are set to vote in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections on May 25, 2024. The results will be announced on June 4.Despite having only seven parliamentary constituencies, Delhi holds significant political importance. Traditionally, the capital has witnessed a direct contest between BJP and Congress. However, since 2013, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has replaced Congress as a major political force in Delhi.The BJP has dominated the last two parliamentary elections in Delhi, winning all seven seats in both 2014 and 2019.In late February, Congress and AAP reached a seat-sharing agreement after weeks of negotiations. Under this agreement, AAP will contest in four constituencies: East Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi, and New Delhi. Congress will field candidates in the remaining three constituencies: Chandni Chowk, North East Delhi, and North West Delhi.The main contenders in Delhi for the upcoming election are thus the BJP and the INDIA bloc, which consists of an alliance between AAP and Congress.In the upcoming election, the BJP has replaced its sitting two-term MP Harsh Vardhan with Praveen Khandelwal, who will be contesting his first Lok Sabha election. Khandelwal's main opponent is 79-year-old JP Agarwal of the Congress, who is contesting his tenthLok Sabha election and has previously represented Chandni Chowk in 1984, 1989, and 1996.Since its first election in 1957, the Congress has won in Chandni Chowk nine times. The BJP and its precursor, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, have won five times, while Sikandar Bakht of the Janata Party was elected in 1977.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Congress candidate Kanhaiya Kumar is contesting against BJP's incumbent MP Manoj Tiwari. Manoj Tiwari is the only BJP MP from the national capital to be re-nominated by the party.This election marks Kanhaiya Kumar's second attempt at a parliamentary seat. In 2019, he contested unsuccessfully against Union Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Minister Giriraj Singh on a Communist Party of India (CPI) ticket from Bihar's Begusarai constituency.Manoj Tiwari aims to secure re-election in North East Delhi and hopes to draw support for the BJP in next year's state assembly elections.For the upcoming polls on May 25, key contenders include Harsh Malhotra of the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party’s Kuldeep Kumar. Gautam Gambhir, the former cricketer and current BJP member, will not be contesting. On March 2, Gambhir requested to be relieved from his political duties in a letter to the BJP leadership.The BJP's prospects are strengthened by the inclusion of former Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely, who ran against Gambhir in 2019 and is popular among Punjabi voters.For the 2024 elections, the BJP has nominated Kamaljeet Sehrawat, a former Mayor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Despite Verma's significant victory in 2019, he has not been granted a ticket this time.The AAP has nominated Mahabal Mishra, an ex-Congress leader who was removed from the party in 2020 and joined the AAP in 2022. Mishra is a former MP and a well-known Purvanchali face, appealing to the large Purvanchali voter base originally from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.For the 2024 elections, the BJP has fielded Yogendra Chandolia, while Udit Raj, a former MP from North West Delhi, is contesting on a Congress ticket. Raj previously represented this constituency from 2014 to 2019 as a BJP member.Despite Hans Raj Hans's significant victory in 2019, the BJP has replaced him with Yogendra Chandolia, a long-time party worker.For the 2024 elections, prominent candidates in the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency include Somnath Bharti from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bansuri Swaraj from the BJP.For the 2024 elections, the BJP has nominated Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is 71 years old. He will face AAP candidate Sahiram Pehalwan, aged 64, who is supported by the Congress. Ramvir Singh Bidhuri was the only BJP candidate to win among the ten assembly segments that make up the South Delhi Lok Sabha seat.Sahiram Pehalwan represents the Tughlakabad constituency in the Delhi assembly, having won twice consecutively in 2015 and 2020 as an AAP candidate.","All seven Lok Sabha constituencies in Delhi are set to vote in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections on May 25, 2024.

Where do you stand? Do you consider him an outsider?

What are your strengths, and why will people vote for INDIA bloc?

Your opposition candidate is saying that the incumbent MP has done no work. Your comments?

INDIA Bloc has pledged to increase reservation in govt jobs. How do you plan to advocate for this in your seat?

Will it be 'abki Baar 400 paar' for the BJP?

INDIA bloc candidate from Shravasti, Chaudhary Ram Shiromani Verma , who is also the sitting MP from the same district, won on a BSP ticket in 2019. This time he has been fielded by Samajwadi Party as the alliance candidate. He says that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is a great leader, and the alliance will perform well in the country. Amid his busy poll schedule, he spoke to Pathikrit Chakraborty on several issues. Excerpts:I have a fair chance, as no development work has been done here despite having a double-engine govt. The entire constituency resonates with the slogan 'abki baar INDIA gathbadhan ki sarkar '. In this poll, I am not fighting the election, but the people are fighting against issues like unemployment and inflation. The entire country is with INDIA bloc. I am not making any comment against Saket ji and do not consider him an outsider. I have support from the people.We have a clear strategy to inform people about BJP's failure in generating jobs and controlling inflation. I am telling the public that if we are voted to power then Rs 1 lakh will be given per year to the unemployed and the poor, while an increase from Rs 280 to Rs 400 will be made under MGNREGA. We will also start the old pension scheme and waive farm loans.Before I became MP, BJP also had members of Parliament from the seat but still no development was done. But when I came, I raised the issue of railway line in Parliament following which the work started and Rs 390 crore sanctioned. The issue had been pending for the last three decades. In the field of education, the seats in the JNV schools were increased from 40 to 80 on my insistence. The airport you see here is because of my efforts. There was no medical college in the district but now it is ready and will be inaugurated soon. A bypass between Barabanki and Shravasti will also be built soon. Let the people decide who has done what work.If we talk about UP, as per estimates, OBCs constitute 52% and Dalits 23%. If voted to power, we will get a caste-based census done. Thereafter, all things will fall in place. This is essential for bringing equality to society.I don’t believe in numbers but have firm faith in the nyay patra of the Congress party and the SP manifesto. I am trying to cover as many villages as possible and tell people about our schemes and governance.

Your astrologer’s prediction on your political fortune is in hot discussion

You were upset when SP denied you a ticket. You wrote a letter to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, which went viral on social media. After all this, you managed to get a

BSP ticket

. How come?

BSP was being dubbed as the ‘B’ team of BJP. The belief got stronger when you were replaced with Shrikala Reddy. What is the reality?

Will you succeed in getting votes of Yadavs as was the case in 2019?

Will Muslim votes prefer BSP when it has no alliance with SP and the latter has fielded a candidate from this seat?

While his astrologer insisted, he would be the MP again, his party (BSP) chose to give Shrikala Reddy, wife of gangster-turned-politician Dhananjay Singh, the ticket from Jaunpur Lok Sabha polls. But just when the nomination process was about to end, BSP brought him back in the poll fray., who won in 2019 as SP-BSP alliance candidate, is out campaigning vigorously to reclaim his seat, and prove his astrologer right. In an interview with, he shares his election strategy . Excerpts.My astrologer had predicted that I would become the MP of Jaunpur again when no party was showing interest in giving me the ticket. When the candidates were decided, and I was not in the list, I contacted him again on May 5, he was still confident in his prediction. Hours later, I got a call from Behanji (Mayawati) confirming my ticket. Now, I have no reason to doubt my astrologer.I was not interested in contesting the election unless SP or BSP leadership had confidence in me. Akhilesh Yadav had assured me to field me as SP candidate and I had started internal preparations but later he refused. I had lost hope and was planning to go to Mumbai when I got a surprise call from Behanji. I said I am ready if it is her wish.I don’t know who uses such a term for BSP. I know I won the 2019 LS poll on a BSP ticket with the blessings of the people of Jaunpur. And, I am confident that I will win again.The SP candidate has come to Jaunpur from Banda to contest the election. Not only Yadavs, but every common man of Jaunpur has seen me working here for five years and raising issues of the district in parliament for over 40 times. The Lok Sabha speaker inducted me in seven parliamentary committees.Muslim voters have remained attached with me and I tackled all their issues without any discrimination. I am fully confident of getting their votes.","Shyam Singh Yadav won in 2019 as SP-BSP alliance candidate.

Polling begins in eight Lok Sabha constituencies in Bihar amid tight security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/polling-begins-in-eight-lok-sabha-constituencies-in-bihar-amid-tight-security/articleshow/110411851.cms,"PATNA: Voting began for eight Lok Sabha seats in Bihar amid tight security on Saturday morning, an official from the office of the state’s chief electoral officer (CEO) said.The polling began at 7 am in Valmikinagar, Pashchim Champaran, Purvi Champaran, Sheohar, Siwan, Gopalganj, Maharajganj and Vaishali constituencies. It would continue till 6 pm, he said.Over 1.49 crore voters will decide the electoral fate of 86 candidates in this phase in the state, the official said.There are 10 candidates in the fray in Valmikinagar, eight in Paschim Champaran, 12 each in Purvi Champaran and Sheohar, 15 in Vaishali, 11 in Gopalganj, 13 in Siwan and five in Maharajganj. Among the 1,49,32,165 electors in the eight constituencies, there are 78,23,793 men, 71,07,944 women and 428 third gender. Interestingly, there are 3,014 electorate in 100+ age group in this phase.Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) is contesting four seats, including Sheohar, which was won by the BJP in 2019 general elections. Other NDA partners – BJP is contesting three seats and LJP (Ram Vilas) – one seat in this round of elections. On the other hand, RJD has fielded four, Congress two and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) two candidates from the opposition INDIA bloc in the sixth phase.Prominent among those whose fate will be sealed in the penultimate phase ofLok Sabha elections are former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh, former Bihar speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary, former state BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, Janardan Singh Sigriwal, Hena Shahab, Lovely Anand, and LJP (RV) candidate Veena Devi.While seven of the eight seats going to polls on Saturday is likely to see direct contests between NDA and INDIA bloc nominees, there would be a triangular fight in Siwan where late Shahabuddin’s wife Hena Shahab has entered the poll fray as an Independent. She will be up against JD(U)’s Vijaylaxmi Kushwaha and RJD’s Awadh Bihari Choudhary.While experts cited multiple factors such as urban voter apathy, heatwave, anti-incumbency, migration, and lengthy voting process for low turnouts in the first five phases of elections in Bihar, political parties are hopeful that the scene is likely to change for the better on Saturday with the improvement in weather conditions and massive electors’ awareness drive launched by the respective district administration.BJP’s Radha Mohan Singh, 74, is eyeing his seventh win from Purvi Champaran. He is pitted against VIP’s Rajesh Kumar, a former MLA, this time. Though overcoming anti-incumbency is a major challenge for Singh, many in the constituency would still vote for him just to ensure the return of Narendra Modi as PM. Govt’s failure to revive the closed sugar mill and open a medical college in the constituency has not gone down well with the many voters. INDIA bloc’s Rajesh Kumar, on the other hand, is banking on Muslim, Yadav, Kushwaha and Mallah votes.In Maharajganj, Sigriwal is pitted against Congress’s Akash Kumar Singh, son of state Congress chief Akhilesh Prasad Singh. While Sigriwal is eyeing to score a hat-trick this time, Singh, then an RLSP candidate, had lost to BJP’s Radha Mohan Singh in Purvi Champaran constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. This time, there is a direct contest between Sigriwal and Singh in Maharajganj.In Gopalganj, JD(U)’s Alok Kumar Suman will fight it out with VIP’s Premnath Chanchal. While Suman made his successful electoral debut in the 2019 polls, Chanchal is a rookie. Interestingly, his father is the district chairman of BJP’s SC/ST cell.In Vaishali, Chirag Paswan-led LJP (Ram Vilas) has retained Veena Devi. She is up against RJD strongman Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla. A close fight is expected between these two candidates in Vaishali, considered as the birthplace of democracy.In Sheohar, RJD has given the ticket to Ritu Jaiswal while JD(U) has fielded strongman Anand Mohan’s wife Lovely Anand, a former MP. Jaiswal is largely dependent on Vaishya and M-Y votes. In the last three Lok Sabha elections, BJP’s Rama Devi, a prominent Vaishya leader, had emerged victorious from the seat.In Paschim Champaran, former state president of BJP Sanjay Jaiswal is eyeing a fourth consecutive win. He slugged it out with Madan Mohan Tiwari of the Congress, a former MLA from Bettiah.In Valmikinagar, JD(U) has reposed faith on Sunil Kumar while RJD has fielded Deepak Yadav. Sunil had won the 2020 Lok Sabha byelection in Valmikinagar, necessitated by the death of his father Baidyanath Mahto, a tall leader of the region.","The polling began at 7 am in Valmikinagar, Pashchim Champaran, Purvi Champaran,.

Jaunpur deserves growth. I am back to bring change: Kripashankar Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaunpur-deserves-growth-i-am-back-to-bring-change/articleshow/110411818.cms,"Rajeev Dikshit

You started your political career with Congress and achieved a lot. What prompted you to switch to BJP?

Gangster-turned-politician Dhananjay Singh has extended his support to you. His supporters and your rivals claim that you played tricks to oust him from the Lok Sabha poll battle. Your take?

Your political base is in Mumbai. What brings you back to Jaunpur?

You were a strong and influential leader during the 10-year rule of the UPA govt. Why did you not make efforts to bring about this change in Jaunpur back then?

As a young man, he migrated to Mumbai in 1971 to earn a livelihood. After initial struggles, he started his political career with the Congress and emerged as north Indian face in Maharashtra by late 1990s. He rose to the position of Mumbai Congress chief, won assembly polls, and held the portfolio of minister of state for home affairs. In 2021, he switched to BJP. 53 years on, Kripashankar Singh , the BJP candidate from Jaunpur , is back to his native place, with a plan to usher in industrial development here so that local talent is no more forced to leave their homes to search for job avenues.In an interview with, he shares his vision for Jaunpur. Excerpts.There is a major difference between the BJP and Congress. In BJP, they do what they say while in Congress, they don’t believe even on their own words and commitments. The recent examples are abolition of article 370 in J&K and consecration of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya. All those who opposed these moves can never be an Indian. This, and many more reasons, guided me to bid goodbye to Congress and join BJP.I am an ordinary soldier of the BJP. If my opponents think that I am so strong that I can dictate the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, I can only salute their thinking.I decided to come back because things have changed drastically here, especially after 2017. In the past seven years, developments on the infrastructure front have been made outstanding. If people will bless me to serve Jaunpur, I promise to usher in major growth in the industrial sector so that the youths of this place do not have to migrate to big cities in search of livelihood options.Had the change, which is visible in Jaunpur and UP after 2014 and 2017, been started after independence, the people from this district and other parts of state would not be forced to migrate to big cities. It was painful for me to leave my home for Mumbai in 1971 in search of livelihood. But such was the story of every sixth north Indian. Despite Jaunpur giving many CMs and PMs, nothing concrete happened here. However, instead of blaming others, including Congress, for poor development of this region, I want to assure the people to bring about the change in the next few years only.","Kripashankar Singh is the BJP candidate from Jaunpur.

Message from Kabir land: ‘Being ‘kattar’ to one’s religion is good’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-from-kabir-land-being-kattar-to-ones-religion-is-good/articleshow/110411490.cms,"“Saheb Bandagi”. A woman devotee greets Sant Ram Saran Das even as she bends to touch his feet. He stops her midway and gently repeats the two words. This unique salutation at this small temple in this part of UP, just 110 km from Ayodhya and 30 km from Gorakhpur, arrests one’s attention. But this is not just another temple. ‘Saheb’ here is this holy site’s ‘presiding deity’ -- Kabir , whose ‘ samadhi ’ it houses since his demise in 1518.The same salutation can be heard a few paces away at another holy structure on this campus on NH 27, connecting Lucknow and Gorakhpur. It has Kabir’s ‘ mazaar ’ (grave) having a peaceful co-existence with his adjacent ‘samadhi’ for the past 500 years. It celebrates the 15th century saint’s life in their own way, without conflict. The campus came into the present form in the 19th century. Now, the outer walls of the campus have Kabir’s couplets (dohe) written on them.Voice Of Sanity“It’s annual urs at the mazaar held on 27 Rajab every year. This year, it fell on March 1,” says Khadim Husain Ansari, the caretaker of ‘Kabir Saheb Ka Mazaar’. He belongs to the family of Ali Bijli Shah, who, he claims, brought Kabir from Kashi, where he spent his entire life, to Maghar , where he passed away.It was said then that those who die in Kashi go to heaven while those who breathe their last in Maghar go to hell. A reformer, Kabir came to Maghar in his last years to explode the myth. But was there a dispute over his last rites between his Hindu and Muslim followers which resulted in the construction of a mazaar and a samadhi side by side? Ansari doesn’t confirm it, nor deny it, but makes sure to add “now there is no dispute.”“Followers of Kabir are all over the world. They come in droves on special occasions here,” he says. The mazaar holds annual urs, the temple celebrates Kabir Festival in January and Kabir Jayanti in the Hindi month of Jyeshtha. PM Narendra Modi came here in June 2018 on the occasion of Kabir’s 500th death anniversary. Two Presidents -- APJ Abdul Kalam and Ram Nath Kovind -- have also visited this Kabir Sthal.Everyday, hundreds of devotees visit both the mazaar and samadhi. Just like Kabir’s teachings and verses, the rituals here are very simple. “People come here to offer ‘chadar’ at the mazaar,” says Anasri. “At the temple, it’s Chauka aarti in the morning and then we recite Kabir’s bhajans and perform aarti,” says Das.They may have different sets of rituals and celebrations but both Ansari and Das are Kabir Panthis. Just like over 4 crore ‘Kabir Panthis’ across the world, they have imbibed the teachings of Kabir that guides one to aspire for ‘Satogun’ (purity and goodness). Both Ansari and Das abstain from ‘maans-madira’ (non-vegetarian food and liquor). “This is the way of life our generations have followed,” Ansari says.“The villages around Kabir Chaura in Maghar have almost 50:50 Hindu-Muslim population but we have never witnessed any conflict, not even during elections when the atmosphere remains so surcharged,” Ansari says.It’s Poll TimeThe Lok Sabha constituency named after Kabir comprises parts of three districts -- Ambedkarnagar, Sant Kabir Nagar and Gorakhpur, and came into existence in 2009 after the delimitation exercise. Here, sitting MP Praveen Nishad, the son of Nishad party chief, is facing a tough contest from fellow casteman Laxmi Kant alias Pappu Nishad of SP. Nadeem Ashraf is BSP’s nominee.Laxmi Kant is a former SP MLA who won from Mehdawal in 2012 and was appointed a minister in the Akhilesh govt. However, he was denied a ticket in both 2017 and 2022 state polls. Akhilesh, however, has reposed his faith in him to wrest the seat which SP has never won in the past. In 2019, Praveen Nishad defeated SP-BSP combine’s Bhishm Shankar Tiwari, the son of Gorakhpur strongman Harishankar Tiwari, by just 10,000 votes. Tiwari had won the seat in 2009. A battle of two Nishads this time is heading to the wire. In neighbouring Basti, sitting MP Harish Dwivedi is up against a formidable challenge from familiar rival and veteran Ram Prasad Chaudhary, who had won the erstwhile Khalilabad parliamentary seat in 1989 on a Janta Party ticket. Thereafter, he won the Kaptanganj assembly seat five times in a row between 1993 and 2017, first time on an SP ticket and then as a BSP candidate. He also served as a minister in Mayawati govt. In 2019, he was a candidate of SP-BSP alliance against Dwivedi and polled just 30,000 less votes than him. Just after the 2019 polls, Mayawati sacked him for anti-party activities and he joined SP.Ask Anasri about the present MP and his prospects, and he fondly goes down the memory lane, recalling former MP Sharad Tripathi, who served the constituency between 2014 and 2019. He passed away in 2021 after prolonged illness. “He was a people’s man. Had he been a candidate, I would have campaigned for him,” he says.Message From Kabir Land“In UP, voting on the communal lines is very common. On what lines does Maghar vote?” “We don’t vote for any party, but the personality,” says Ansari. Das, sitting just 50 metres away at the temple, echoes the sentiments.Then, on a cue, Ansari goes on “Nowadays we see a distorted form of ‘kattarta’ (fanaticism). We call a person ‘kattar’ Hindu or ‘kattar’ Muslim to decry them. Agar koi apne dharm ke prati kattar ho jaye to insan ban jaaye (If one becomes devoted to one’s religion one will become a true human being) because no religion teaches hate.”","Kabir Saheb Ka Mazaar in Maghar, Uttar Pradesh, has a peaceful co-existence with his'samadhi' for the past 500 years. The mazaar holds annual urs, the temple celebrates Kabir Festival in January and Kabir Jayanti in the Hindi month of Jyeshtha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110411610,imgsize-1300247,width-400,resizemode-4/110411610.jpg"

: 45 seats, including all 10 in Haryana, 9 out of 14 in Uttar Pradesh, all 8 in Bihar, all 7 in Delhi, 5 out of 8 in West Bengal, all 4 in Jharkhand and 2 out of 6 in Odisha.Odisha where it had only two of these seats last time, and UP where BSP, which won 4 of these seats, is going it alone this time.4 seats, including 3 of 8 seats in West Bengal and 1 of 14 in UPAlmost all the states in this round, but more so in Bihar, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand, where it had drawn a blank in these seats ﬁve years ago.The lone seat polling today in J&K (shifted to this phase from Phase 3), which can’t be shown as won by any party in 2019 since seat boundaries have been redrawn.: Delhi’s next-door neighbour, with modern urban centres like Gurgaon to its south and a sweeping agrarian belt to the north, is a complex political ﬁeld with BJP and Congress as principal opponents. Prolonged farmers’ protests, the agitation by wrestlers, discontent among youth over the Agnipath scheme, and long waits for govt jobs are in the mix as Congress seeks to turn the tables on BJP after 10 years in the wilderness. Anti-incumbency and a leadership haze in the state unit, with Nayab Singh Saini named CM only in March, mean BJP is heavily reliant on the Modi factor. Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, meanwhile, is back at the forefront of the Congress campaign and will see the LS poll as staging ground for the assembly push later this year.: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s arrest in the backdrop, the national capital votes today in the middle of arguably the bitterest political feud it has seen. With 7 seats, Delhi’s LS pool is small but central to national themes — misuse of central agencies and putting political rivals in jail for opposition parties, and crusade against corruption for BJP — that the Lok Sabha election is being fought on. So high are the stakes that BJP will be disappointed with anything less than another 7-0 scorecard — which will make it a hat-trick of clean sweeps for it in general elections since 2014 — and the INDIA bloc, with Congress and AAP in alliance, will take any gain as a vindication of its stand about the PM trying to crush the opposition using state machinery. Kejriwal, who is out on bail, has run an emotive campaign, connecting his freedom to the outcome of the election. Now, the people will decide.BJP (Sanjay Bhatia)Manohar Lal Khattar (BJP), Divyanshu Budhiraja (Cong)Removed as CM just before the general elections were announced, Manohar Lal Khattar (70) has been shifted by BJP to the Lok Sabha arena from his home constituency with BJP indicating he will get bigger responsibilities at the Centre. With Nayab Singh Saini, who replaced Khattar as CM, contesting the assembly bypoll from this seat after Khattar vacated it, Karnal is at the heart of the BJP campaign. Khattar’s main rival is 30-year-old Divyanshu Budhiraja, president of Haryana Youth Congress. Also in the fray are JJP’s Devender Kadian and Virender Maratha from NCP, which is supported by INLD.: BJP (Nitesh Ganga Deb): Dharmendra Pradhan (BJP), Pranab Prakash Das (BJD)Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP’s prominent Odisha face, is making a comeback to the electoral arena after 15 years in this prestigious west Odisha constituency that BJP won in 2019. Pradhan, a part of the Modi Cabinet who has called on voters to strengthen the hands of the PM, faces a canny challenger in BJD strategist and organisational general secretary Pranab Prakash Das. Sambalpur has demonstrated a pattern of shifting political allegiances over the past three elections. Congress won in 2009, followed by BJD in 2014 and BJP in 2019. Sambalpur, where the Hirakud dam is located, has been at the forefront of a long-standing movement for the establishment of a bench of the Odisha high court here. BJD has thrown its organisational machinery behind Das’s campaign with BJP calling him an “outsider”, since he is from a different part of Odisha. Though two strong candidates are in the ring, the ﬁght here is between ‘Modi’s guarantees’ and CM Naveen Patnaik’s massive welfare push.BJP ( Rao Inderjit Singh ): Rao Inderjit Singh (BJP), Raj Babbar (Cong)Union minister and ﬁve-time MP Rao Inderjit Singh takes on Congress veteran Raj Babbar in this high-proﬁle ﬁght to Delhi’s south, in a city not known for politics but business. The entry of Babbar, a Punjabi, has brought a different dynamic to the poll arithmetic because the party has always preferred Yadav candidates from this Ahir stronghold. But, even with BJP’s troubles in Haryana, breaching the fortress Singh has built will take some doing. As a result, it’s often been said during the campaign that Gurgaon is BJP’s “safest seat” this time. Singh’s inﬂuence extends across the Ahirwal belt of south Haryana and is seen as an important factor in optimism in the saffron camp about winning all three seats here.BJP (Arvind Sharma)Arvind Sharma (BJP), Deepender Hooda (Cong)In the large victory margins of the 2019 Lok Sabha election for BJP in the state, Rohtak stood out for its close contest as Arvind Sharma scraped through by just 7,503 votes. This time, it’s perhaps the seat Congress is most conﬁdent in. With BJP renominating Sharma, Rohtak will see a 2019 rematch in a seat that was former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s stronghold before BJP breached it. His son Deepender, who has represented Rohtak thrice in the Lok Sabha in 2005, 2009 and 2014, hopes to wrest the seat on the back of a good Congress performance in the 2019 assembly election here. Sharma, who switched to BJP from Congress in 2014, was an MP from Karnal in 2004 and 2009.NC* (Hasnain Masoodi)Mehbooba Mufti (PDP), Mian Altaf (NC), Zafar Iqbal Manhas (Apni Party)Far from the comfort of home turf Anantnag, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti faces a tough challenge in this constituency, which includes large parts of Jammu’s Poonch and Rajouri districts. Not only did a PDP-NC alliance not work out, she now faces NC’s Mian Altaf, a Gujjar spiritual head. Thanks to altered boundaries, the demography is a mix of Kashmiri Muslims, Gujjars and Bakerwals, and the Pahari community that includes Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. The central govt led by BJP, which is not in the fray, has included Paharis and three other communities in the ST list. PDP and NC have labelled Apni Party candidate Zafar Iqbal Manhas, a Pahari, a BJP proxy. *Constituency redrawn after delimitationBJP (Maneka Gandhi)Maneka Gandhi (BJP), Ram Bhuwal Nishad (SP), Udraj Verma (BSP)UP’s constituency No. 38 has always remained in the shadow of its neighbours, Amethi (No. 37) and Rae Bareli (No. 36), even though Sultanpur was district headquarters of a major part of Amethi parliamentary constituency before it became a separate district in 2010. A Gandhi contested from this seat for the ﬁrst time in 2014 when BJP ﬁelded Varun from here, shifting him from Pilibhit. He went back to Pilibhit in 2019, making way for his mother Maneka. Both won and Maneka is now back in the fray from here for her ninth term in Parliament. Last time, she won by a slender margin of 14,000 votes. This time, she is facing a formidable challenge in the form of SP’s Ram Bhuwal Nishad, a two-time former MLA who started with BSP and was brieﬂy with BJP. While Maneka is conﬁdent her connection with people will see her through, Nishad is banking on the support of Muslim voters and consolidation of non-Yadav OBCs.: BJP (Manoj Tiwari): Manoj Tiwari (BJP), Kanhaiya Kumar (Cong)The most discussed of Delhi’s electoral contests, this became a high-voltage, high-decibel ﬁght after Congress decided to ﬁeld Kanhaiya Kumar, the former JNU Students’ Union president, against BJP’s Manoj Tiwari. The Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician is the only MP in Delhi who was re-nominated by BJP, which won all seven seats in the capital not just in 2019 but also in 2014, the year Narendra Modi became PM. The constituency has a sizable population of Poorvanchali voters, and both Tiwari and Kanhaiya are from Bihar. Kanhaiya had contested his last Lok Sabha election from Begusarai in Bihar and lost to BJP’s Giriraj Singh. While he has repeatedly accused Tiwari of “zero” development in North East Delhi, BJP calls him a member of the “tukde-tukde” gang. Tiwari had defeated AAP’s Anand Kumar in 2014 and former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit in 2019.","The LS poll reaches Delhi in its penultimate phase as the BJP-AAP face-off is put to the ballot test.

"In battle of turncoats, Dhananjay Singh has added ‘tadka’ with his changing loyalties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-battle-of-turncoats-dhananjay-singh-has-added-tadka-with-his-changing-loyalties/articleshow/110411424.cms,"The political landscape of Jaunpur belies its sleepy demeanour. The political churning that began in the medieval times has continued to this era. The town famous for its ‘imartis’ (dessert) has given a taste of success to all major parties and this is the reason why stakes are high in this too.Amid the battle of turncoats fielded by BJP and SP, local strongman Dhananjay Singh has added ‘tadka’ to the contest with his swift and swinging loyalties within days.The dramatic ripples in Jaunpur’s political bowl started on March 3 when BJP announced the candidature of former Maharashtra minister and former Congressman Kripashankar Singh. Next day, Dhananjay Singh, who was elected MP on a BSP ticket from the seat in 2009, expressed his wish to enter the fray. But the plan got nixed when a local court convicted him on March 6 in an extortion-kidnapping case and handed him a 7-year jail term. Dhananjay headed to the jail but managed to secure the BSP ticket for his wife and zila panchayat chairperson Srikala Reddy from the seat. His confinement too was brief as the ‘bahubali’ neta walked out of jail on May 1 after getting bail from the Allahabad high court. However, Mayawati stumped Dhananjay’s poll calculations and replaced Srikala with party’s sitting MP Shyam Singh Yadav on the last day of filing of nomination for Jaunpur. An upset Dhananjay extended support to BJP on May 14 and Srikala joined the saffron bandwagon though it was too late to get the ticket.Kripashankar Singh, who joined the BJP in 2021 after quitting Congress, is pitching for his roots. Hailing from a Rajput family of Jaunpur, Singh is playing the ‘homecoming’ card. For local voters, the changing equations are a bit confusing. Arun Tripathi, a real estate businessman, says, “The past two months for BJP supporters, who also have good relations with Dhananjay, were difficult. Anger of Dhananjay’s sympathisers was getting fuelled with developments like jail term and Srikala being replaced. Things though have cooled now after Dhananjay opened his card and alliedwith BJP.” Local BJP leaders like Surendra Pratap Singh and Vidyasagar Sonkar say BJP has found a cushion with Dhananjay’s decision.Samajwadi Party is banking on caste calculations and support from Muslims. SP has fielded BSP turnout Babu Singh Kushwaha, once a close lieutenant of BSP supremo Mayawati before he fell out of favour after getting mired in the infamous National Rural Health Mission scam. It’s a battle of revival for Kushwaha, who has been in the political wilderness since teh scam. Kushwaha’s entry had upset the local SP cadre as he arrived in the town with his chosen poll managers. SP leadership had to intervene and pacify the party ranks to set the ball rolling. The party has intensified campaigning among its traditional voters of Mauryas and Kushwahas.Sources say sitting BSP MP Shyam Singh Yadav, whom the party had denied the ticket initially, had opened talks with the SP and was even promised a ticket from Janupur but Kushwaha made the final cut. Jaunpur-based lawyer Brijbhushan Singh says, “Despite all twists and turns, Jaunpur will not be a cakewalk for any contender because of caste and communal equations.”Town’s 19.58 lakh voters expect a close contest as each Brahim, Rajput, OBC, Muslim and Dalit votes have almost equal share of around 15%. It has sent 11 Rajputs, 4 Yadavs and 2 Brahmins to Parliament so far. “Dalit voters play a key role. In 2014 they ensured a smooth win for BJP but drifted towards BSP in 2019,” says Jamil, another local resident. However, a section of people says that Dhananjay Singh may not be a result decider since his political stature became known in 2014 when he could bag only 64,000 votes and failed to get re-elected.","The dramatic ripples in Jaunpur’s political bowl started on March 3 when BJP announced the candidature of former Maharashtra minister Kripashankar Singh.

How BJP’s ‘Saini gambit’ to corner non-Jat votes is playing out in Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-bjps-saini-gambit-to-corner-non-jat-votes-is-playing-out-in-haryana/articleshow/110411443.cms,"Will BJP ’s strategy of building a broad non-Jat coalition in Haryana work in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, in the absence of a wave and in the face of visible discontent among farmers? Analysts say the approach is likely to pay dividends, but it also runs the risk of a further consolidation of Jat votes behind Opposition ranks.The strategy isn’t new. BJP, which has been in power in Haryana since 2014, had made Manohar Lal Khattar , a Punjabi, the chief minister. Earlier this year, the party replaced Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC. Both moves were seen as attempts to consolidate sections of the nonJat votes. Over the past decade, the party has been steadily mopping up non-Jat votes to win both in the assembly and Lok Sabha polls.“The approach seems to be working for BJP in these elections as well. The state is already polarised on the lines of Jat and nonJat politics. BJP has now found another base by appeasing the Sainis and others in the OBC group,” says Satish Tyagi, a political expert, author and senior journalist from Rohtak .However, this time, there are new challenges. For instance, there’s no overarching narrative cutting across constituencies. “BJP seems to be losing ground in constituencies with the highest population of Jats, such as Rohtak, Sonipat, Hisar, Bhiwani Mahendargarh and Kurukshetra.That’s because Jats, who are feeling sidelined under the BJP regime, are uniting against the party,” says Tyagi.Also, a long-standing but little talked about divide between Jats and Punjabis appears to be playing a role in the elections. Punjabis (10-12% of the state’s population) have been gravitating to the BJP, particularly because the community felt sidelined in the race for govt jobs in previous regimes. “Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s promise of reservation for Jats had further widened the rift, making caste lines more rigid,” according to political commentator Hemant Atri. AJat reservation bill was passed in 2016 after a months-long agitation, from which BJP benefited in the 2019 Lok Sabha and subsequent assembly polls.The appointment of Khattar as CM brought cheer to the Punjabi community but it did little to bridge the growing caste divide.The move to make Saini the CM is seen as an attempt to garner support of the state’s OBC population, which constitutes around 20-22% of the electorate. The Saini community, although only about 2.5% of the state’s population, is seen as a gateway to the larger OBC demographic. Even so, Nayab Singh’s elevation was not universally welcomed and some OBC groups, like the Yadavs, raised questions about their representation.“It’s good to see the OBCs rising,” said Ashu Yadav, a medical store employee in Rohtak. “But our caste should also be accommodated.”Congress though does not see Saini’s appointment as having much of an impact. “Nothing has changed (after he was elected CM). People are confused as to who their CM is. Some people still think it’s Khattar,” said Selja Kumari, the Congress LS candidate from Sirsa.Jats and Punjabis have emerged as two distinct blocs this time with their support lying with Congress and BJP, respectively, although there’s also the urban-rural divide to contend with. While a majority of Punjabi voters — settled mostly in urban areas — support BJP, some sections continue to back Congress. However, most Jats consider Congress, INLD, and JJP their preferred parties. In rural areas, there appears to be barely any support for BJP this time, thanks to the farmer protests.“The Jat-Punjabi issue is not being openly discussed by parties but people openly talk about it,” says Rohtak-based journalist Virender Phogat.Many Punjabis seem to rejoice in the fact that they aren’t governed by Jats anymore. “The previous govts gave all benefits and jobs to Jats. There was an unsaid rule that nearly nine out of 10 govt jobs would go to Jats. It’s good that that’s changing,” says Piyush Kataria, a shopkeeper in Rohtak district.","BJP has been steadily mopping up non-Jat votes to win both in the assembly and Lok Sabha polls.

"Ground beneath their feet is red-hot, but Jharia residents just can’t leave",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ground-beneath-their-feet-is-red-hot-but-jharia-residents-just-cant-leave/articleshow/110411378.cms,"With inputs from Divy Khare

JHARIA: The earth beneath your feet is hot as pan, ready to crumble like cookies any moment. You can sense the vibrations of raging flames underneath and watch fumes emanating through cracks and fissures on ground here and there. The air is loaded with a pungent odour of burning sulphur ammonia and bitumen and a waft of colourless, odourless gas braces your face at intervals, pushing you to the brink of losing consciousness.Welcome to Jharia — the city of black diamond for some and the ‘hell on earth’ for others. Boasting the richest reserves of high-quality bitumen used in the production of coke to fuel steel industry, the region is also known for the century-old underground coal fire that has resulted in extreme damage to life and property since 1916.Elections come and go, govts change but little has changed for the residents, most of whom have accepted the impending catastrophe as their fate. “They ask us to relocate to the Belgaria colony, but we have to eat to survive.What are we supposed to do there to earn a living,” asks Santoshi Devi (name changed on request), a woman from among the four families who have refused to vacate their mud shanties in Basti No.7 of Bastakola colliery. She has witnessed her neighbour, Mandalji, a shopkeeper, falling into a crevice on the ground a few months ago and burning his feet completely.People in the locality blame these families and hundreds of those living a few hundred metres far from the fire spot for “risking their lives out of their greed for stealing coal”. “You can see heaps of coal being fired in and around to make coke-coal. They will sell it to the market and earn a living. If they are relocated to Belgaria, the resettlement colony made by Bharat Coking Coal Ltd ( BCCL ), they will lose their livelihood,” said a young man from one of those families who have refused to relocate.Rupesh Kumar, 11, who has stopped going to school now, also engages in picking coal. For the poor in colliery, earning through coal picking depends on number of hands engaged.Jharia Coalfield Bachao Samity president Rajiv Sharma, however, refuses to accept the theory that BCCL has given ample facilities to relocate the people. The Samity wrote a letter to the principal secretary at the Prime Minister’s office last month with a list of suggestions on what must be done for the Jharia residents so that they can relocate. Activists believe underground fire is a ‘trump card’ in the hands of BCCL and govt to displace the people without compensating them adequately.“In the name of underground fire and lurking danger to lives, people are being asked to vacate their land and go to the ‘cage-like-houses’ in Belgaria on which thousands of crores of rupees have been spent by the Jharia Rehabilitation Development Authority without applying mind,” Sharma said.He added that the land losers must be compensated under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.Sharma’s demand is corroborated by the fire-affected people in other regions of Jharia as well. Coal transport machine driver Anil Kumar Thakur believes the alternate arrangement provided to them is not sufficient. “I have no complaints with the company I work for but what about the govt. They have left us at the mercy of coal companies. Shouldn’t they intervene and set a standard of compensation,” he asked.Thakur has decided to exercise his franchise on Saturday and ensure there is some change.“We can’t say our elected representatives do not come here.

The political blame-game continued even as the authorities struggled to identify the remaining nine charred bodies and finally decided to opt for genetic profiling.Thane police arrested owner Malay Mehta late on Friday on a tip-off that he would visit the Thane's Court naka area. A case of culpable homicide has been registered against him and others at the Manpada police station.

Thane police said that a comprehensive probe would be carried out into the company's legal documents, equipment details such as age and condition, procurement details and other relevant factors.Earlier in the day, fire brigade officials found the three bodies, said KDMC chief fire officer Namdev Chaudhary.

"In heat-related deaths, autopsy not must for certification: NCDC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-heat-related-deaths-autopsy-not-must-for-certification-ncdc/articleshow/110407641.cms,"NEW DELHI: Autopsy is not mandatory to certify heat-related deaths , the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said. In its guideline released recently on heat-related deaths, NCDC said the diagnosis of hyperthermia-abnormally high body temperature-is dependent mostly on the scene of investigation, circumstances of death, and reasonable exclusion of alternative causes of death.

According to NCDC guidelines, a heat-related fatality is defined as a death caused by exposure to high ambient temperatures or one in which high ambient temperatures significantly contributed to the death. For example, the guideline suggests, a death should be certified as heat stroke or hyperthermia if the body temperature of the deceased was higher than 105°F (40.6°C) just before death.

""In cases where the ante-mortem (before death) body temperature cannot be established but the environmental temperature at the time of collapse was high, an appropriate heat-related diagnosis should be listed as the cause of death or as a significant contributing condition,"" NCDC adds.

Supreme Court stays Uttarakhand HC ambitious relocation plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-uttarakhand-hc-ambitious-relocation-plan/articleshow/110407485.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday stayed Uttarakhand high court's ambitious order that had rejected a 26-acre plot at Haldwani for relocation of the overcrowded HC complex at Nainital and sought an appropriate site from the state to construct a new HC building with 7,000 chambers for lawyers.Appearing for Uttarakhand HC Bar Association, advocate P B Suresh with counsel Vipin Nair took a preliminary yet potent objection to the jurisdiction and power of the HC to direct shifting of HC's principal seat, which can only be ordered by the President after Parliament passes a bill to that effect.Before a vacation bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Sanjay Karol, they argued that HC had power to create circuit or permanent benches at different places in a state with prior approval of the governor concerned. As Centre through SG Tushar Mehta supported the bar association's plea, the bench stayed the May 8 order of the HC.The stay from SC comes two days before the May 26 hearing before a HC bench of Chief Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Rakesh Thapliyal, which had directed the state chief secretary to locate suitable land for establishment of HC complex, residential accommodations for judges, judicial officers and staff, conference hall, chambers for at least 7,000 lawyers, canteen, parking space, along with good medical facilities. SC has provided for 700-odd lawyers chambers .""This exercise shall be completed by the chief secretary within a month and submit a report to the HC by June 7,"" it had said, while asking HC registrar general to put in motion a poll to seek opinions of lawyers and litigants on desirability of shifting the HC complex from Nainital.The state had allotted 26-acre land at Golapur in Haldwani for shifting the HC complex. Finding the land to be surrounded by forest, which formed 75% of allotted land, the CJ-led bench had said the HC ""does not want to uproot any of the trees to make a new HC."" The bench had asked the state to allot a suitable site at some other place.Before SC, HC bar association in its plea through Vinod Khanna said the HC could not have ordered for an opinion poll as ""only Parliament or Centre could decide on establishment of a principal bench of a HC in a state."" However, bar association of Dehradun supported the HC order and requested SC not to interfere with it as the HC complex is congested, making it difficult for lawyers, litigants and judges to function properly.","Supreme Court stays Uttarakhand high court's ambitious order that had rejected a 26-acre plot at Haldwani for relocation of the overcrowded HC complex at Nainital.
