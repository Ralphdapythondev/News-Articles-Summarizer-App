A mom for the mothers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-mom-for-the-mothers/articleshow/114799238.cms,"The call came at 1am. Dr Aparna Hegde rushed to the emergency room. She will never forget what she saw: “A beautiful, frail young woman with the head of a dead baby sticking out of her”.Aruna, 25, had just about made it to Sion Hospital in the heart of Mumbai for her first delivery after a journey of 30km from a hospital on the city outskirts. Undiagnosed gestational diabetes meant her baby’s body was too large to come out. Three days after that harrowing Friday night of 1996, when Hegde — then a resident doctor — found herself using a needle and twine to join the infant’s body back with its head, Aruna passed away.“Not only did she die a horrible death, it was preventable,” says Hegde. Aruna was not told about the danger signs and potential complications from gestational diabetes during her first visit to the gynaecologist. She wasn’t told to follow up with regular check-ups either. “If only she had been...” Hegde trails off. That unfinished thought birthed an NGO in 2008.In a country where an Aruna dies every 20 minutes, ARMMAN (Advancing Reduction In Mortality And Morbidity Of Mothers, Children And Neonates) has been working to ensure pregnant women and mothers seek timely healthcare, and health workers are equipped to provide quality services through timely voice calls and video messaging services.“Information is empowerment,” says Hegde. “Lack of access to information is the biggest reason for maternal and child mortality in India.” Her 16-year-old NGO now boasts nearly 4 lakh frontline workers across 21 states who have reached more than 5.2 crore women and their children. “The goal is to reach 7 crore women and their children and train 8.5 lakh health workers by 2030,” says the Stanford alumnus.While a recent UN report says India’s share of global maternal deaths has dropped from 26% in 1990 to 8% in 2020 — a positive fall attributed to women increasingly opting to go to the hospital for delivery — Hegde says it’s not enough.“In the next one hour, three women will die while giving birth. For every woman who dies, 20 more suffer debilitating morbidity. Two children below five years die every minute. Thirty per cent of children under five are malnourished and 35.5% are stunted. These are not just physical problems, but sociocultural phenomena rooted in gender discrimination,” says the urogynaecologist. While the focus on hospital deliveries has cut down deaths, Hegde says lack of awareness and access to primary maternity care, and lack of training among health workers, leads to systemic deficiencies.“The experience of antenatal (pre-birth) care in a govt hospital can be very apathetic in urban India,” says Hegde. “In rural India, ASHA workers don’t get an incentive for counselling. They can’t visit homes more than once a month. So, you can’t counsel mothers-to-be when required. Also, since the primary care system does not work very well, you would have women whose cases can be managed by level-two hospitals getting sent to a tertiary hospital, leading to overcrowding.”Hegde chanced upon the solution in a village in mid2000s Karnataka where she spotted an affirming sight: a villager using a cellphone to tell her employer that she would be late to work.ARMMAN’s free mobile voice call service, mMitra, was born. It sends targeted preventive care information twice a week to the enrolled women throughout pregnancy and infancy in their chosen language and time. The alerts continue till the child is a year old. And it pays attention to the details as well. For example, while mothers-to-be are told about the importance of taking iron pills in the second month of pregnancy to tackle anaemia, it also advises them on how to take these pills. “Avoid coffee after taking the pill as it reduces the absorption of iron,” warns the voice. Two weeks later, women are also told how to tackle the adverse effects of iron pills. “Women loved it,” recalls Hegde.Mumbai-based Sonia Gawde received a call from mMitra when she was seven months pregnant with her second child. “Your baby should be kicking by now,” the voice said in Marathi. She felt nothing. Gawde approached her doctor and learned that her foetus had died in the womb. Gawde soon became a ‘sakhi’, a trained community health worker, to enrol women directly in the early stages of pregnancy, at mMitra. She has had a healthy boy since. mMitra’s success would lead to the Union ministry of health and family welfare tying up with ARMMAN for the implementation of a similar mobilebased maternal messaging programme by the govt, called Kilkari, expanding the NGO’s reach. “Kilkari motivated me to become a health worker,” 25-year-old Chhattisgarh-based Puja Verma told ARMMAN’s team recently.After listening to the calls all through her pregnancy, when this new mother from Raipur district applied to become a frontline health worker, her familiarity with maternal and child health made an impression on the village selection committee. “One aspect I really like about Kilkari is that it focuses on the health and recovery of the mother, too, post-childbirth,” says Sabita Maliful from Odisha’s Nabarangpur district. Mother of a six month-old, Sabita says the calls have guided her on breastfeeding, immunisation, and nutrition after delivery. “Even my husband started listening to the calls,” says Sabita.“It took me five years to get the first rupee into ARMMAN. I knocked on hundreds of doors. At that point, there was no CSR and the idea of using tech for medical care was alien. Now, of course, post-Covid, it (virtual medical care) seems so obvious, right?” laughs Hedge. “The most underprivileged women want to know when their child will be able to tell colour, when their child will develop fingers in their womb and so on.Armed with information, women are upending patriarchal family dynamics, challenging entrenched mores, and demanding care.” In Assam, which has India’s highest maternal mortality rate, ASHA worker Lacky Rani is discussing issues like family planning and open defecation with new mothers. “Most women need help in these areas,” says Rani, who attributes her newfound confidence on such uneasy subjects to Dr Anita, a voice on Mobile Academy, a mobile-based govt audio service implemented by ARMMAN.“The glaring absence of comprehensive guidelines for the management of high-risk pregnancies means that health workers remain largely unaware of when and how to refer women to higher centres for treatment, what counselling to give, and what they need to do when a pregnant woman is referred back from a higher centre,” says Hegde.Of the 35 “evidence-based guidelines for management of high-risk conditions” prescribed by ARMMAN as part of its programme to train auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), medical officers, and specialist doctors in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, many have recently been drafted into govt policy by the two states.“With the vast geographical, social, and cultural diversity in India, the interventions have to break the barriers of socio-cultural-politico-economic norms and address existing inequities in society to enhance the decision-making powers for women when it comes to their health,” says Hegde, adding that ARMMAN is now looking to harness AI and predictive analytics to understand the reasons for low listenership and dropouts, and set aside funds to retain them. “We are now focusing on both husband and wife,” says Hegde.(Know about any such inspiring story?

Silver outshines gold for first time in festive season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silver-outshines-gold-for-first-time-in-festive-season/articleshow/114795481.cms,"HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of the Indian jewellery market , silver glittered more than gold this Dhanteras . As gold prices continued their record-breaking run, it dampened consumer demand. Shoppers instead rushed to buy silver."" Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras,"" Surendra Mehta, national secretary at Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), said. ""We are collating data for silver because this is the first time we are seeing such a huge demand,"" Mehta told TOI.For one, the high price of gold dissuaded many buyers and prompted them to look at silver instead. In addition to the demand for silver jewellery, the expected high industrial demand for the white metal - mainly from booming EV manufacturers - is making it the most sought-after precious metal now. ""People have now begun to understand that there is a real opportunity in investing in silver,"" Mehta added.While demand for silver during Dhanteras this year surged 30-35%, sales of gold were 15% lower at around 35-36 tonne as compared to 42 tonne last festive season. However, thanks to about a 30% rise in average price of the yellow metal, sales (in value terms) were higher at nearly Rs 28,000 crore from about Rs 24,000-25,000 crore last year.The World Gold Council too has projected that India's gold demand could hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the unprecedented record-breaking rally in prices. In Wednesday's mid-session, gold prices on NYMEX went above the $2,800-per-ounce mark for the first time in history on the back of global uncertainties relating to geopolitical issues, the US election, as well as continuing demand from central banks and the solar energy industry.Gold demand in India - the world's secon-biggest consumer of the precious metal - could stand between 700 tonne and 750 tonne in 2024, the lowest since 2020 and down from last year's 761 tonne, Sachin Jain, regional CEO (India) at WGC, was quoted as saying by Reuters.In the local market and commodities exchange, gold price was hovering above the Rs 80,000 per 10 gram level, while silver prices stayed above the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst (commodities) at HDFC Securities, said that gold's record on Wednesday came after the US treasury yields and the dollar fell following mixed US macro data.",Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras. World Gold Council too has projected that India's gold demand could hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the unprecedented record-breaking rally in prices.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114795581,imgsize-1043281,width-400,resizemode-4/114795581.jpg"

This revelations came to light after the candidates, contesting elections on newly formed Jan Suraaj 's tickets, submitted their affidavits to Election Commission.The Jan Suraaj candidates are contesting in byelections from all four seats in the state - Belaganj, Imamganj, Ramgarh, and Tarari.What has surprised everyone is that 75% of the candidates, picked by the just-formed party, allegedly have a ""tainted image,"" leaving the political experts baffled.Of the three, the party's Imamganj candidate, Jitendra Paswan, faces serious criminal cases like kidnapping, cheating, theft, and assault, according to his self-attested poll affidavit filed before EC.

This is the highest stock with the Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) in the last two decades, as per records available on its website.Officials said the huge stock is an issue and liquidating this stockpile is a challenge even as the govt allowed states to take extra rice directly from the FCI for their own schemes and sale of 23 lakh tonnes of the grain to ethanol distilleries.According to available data, the FCI had a stockpile of 299 lakh tonnes of rice and another 13 lakh tonnes receivable from millers. As per govt's buffer norms, the agency needs to keep 102.5 lakh tonnes as stock to meet the food security scheme and other welfare programmes of govt as on Oct 1.The rice stock has increased due to higher procurement by govt agencies. Moreover, the Centre had stopped the sale of rice to states from the central pool last year and banned the export of non-basmati white rice, besides imposing duty on the outbound shipment of white and parboiled rice to address food inflation and deficient rainfall.Only in the past three months, govt took several decisions, including allowing states to buy rice from FCI, allowing export of non-basmati white rice and removal of export duty on parboiled rice.Meanwhile, the food ministry has said paddy procurement was under way in full swing in Punjab and Haryana, the two major food bowls of the country, and like every year 185 lakh and 60 lakh tonnes of paddy would likely be procured from the states, during the current kharif marketing season.",Rice stock with govt is set to touch around 300 lakh tonnes on November 1.

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka high court on Wednesday granted interim bail for six weeks to jailed actor Darshan Thoogudeepa , prime accused in the Renukaswamy murder case .The bail was granted to the actor on medical grounds to undergo spine surgery. As per the bail condition, the actor has been asked to surrender his passport.Darshan is currently lodged in Karnataka's Ballari jail.Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty reserved the order on Tuesday on actor Darshan’s interim bail application after hearing comprehensive arguments from his legal counsel, senior advocate C.V. Nagesh, and the state’s public prosecutor, P. Prasanna Kumar.During the hearing, the state submitted medical reports in a sealed cover from doctors at Ballari Central Prison, where Darshan is being held, and from the head of Neurology at a government hospital in Ballari.Nagesh argued that Darshan is experiencing numbness in both feet and requested permission for him to undergo surgery at a private hospital in Mysuru, with the actor covering all associated costs.According to police reports, 33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan of Darshan, allegedly sent obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda, Darshan’s friend and a co-accused in the case, which angered Darshan and supposedly led to the murder.Renukaswamy’s body was discovered on June 9 near a stormwater drain by an apartment in Sumanahalli, Bengaluru. Police investigations revealed that Raghavendra, one of Darshan’s fan club members in Chitradurga, brought Renukaswamy to a shed in R.R. Nagar, claiming that Darshan wanted to meet him. It was there that Renukaswamy was reportedly tortured and murdered.The post-mortem report revealed that Renukaswamy, a native of Chitradurga, died from shock and hemorrhage due to multiple blunt injuries.Police have identified Pavithra, the primary accused, as a key instigator in Renukaswamy’s murder, asserting that she conspired with others involved and played an active role in the crime.","Darshan Thoogudeepa is prime accused in the Renukaswamy murder case.

India and China have completed pulling back their troops from two face-off points at Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh, just days after signing a patrolling pact to ease tensions along the Line of Actual Control( LAC ), several media reports citing Army sources said on Wednesday.Reports said the troops of both countries have fallen back to their pre-April 2020 positions after dismantling their temporary posts, sheds, tents and other structures erected in the two areas.Over the next few days, both sides will verify the mutual pullback of troops before coordinated patrolling resumes, sources told news agencies.Sources further said ground commanders will continue to hold talks and ""exchange of sweets on Diwali is set to happen on Thursday"".The Army plans to launch its patrols in Depsang and Demchok by the end of the month, with advance notice being given to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to prevent the possibility of any face-off or clash.The PLA will also intimate India before sending out its patrols, under the ""patrolling arrangements"" for Depsang-Demchok first announced by India on October 21 after a flurry of diplomatic and military talks.Reports said talks are also underway to ease the situation in other high tension areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh.On October 21, India had announced an agreement with China on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, ending an over four-year military standoff triggered by a clash in Galwan Valley.Soon after the announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics Summit in Russia, where both leaders welcomed the agreement.The disengagement process began around October 24, with troops from both sides starting to withdraw from key friction points.

NEW DELHI: The Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) MP and national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi launched a fierce attack on Congress party for its allegations against Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday. He pointed to the EC's detailed 1,642-page response to Congress's accusations, calling it evidence of grand old party's ""vengeful pride"" and ""suspiciously covert"" motives.Trivedi raised questions about Congress's selective criticism of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). He pointed out that EVMs functioned without issues in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi but allegedly malfunctioned in Rajasthan in 2023 and in Haryana.""The EC's extensive 1,642-page response to Congress's baseless and absurd accusations underscores the party's vengeful pride for power--'I am right if I win, and if I lose, someone else is responsible.' This attitude isn't merely amusing but suspicious. Congress's attempts to cast aspersions on the dignity of constitutional institutions are not just ridiculous; they are slyly subversive,"" Trivedi said during a press conference in New Delhi.He questioned why EVMs worked well in some states but allegedly failed in others. ""EVMs worked perfectly in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal, and Delhi. They performed well in Rajasthan in 2018 but not in 2023. In Haryana, they allegedly malfunctioned,"" Trivedi added.Trivedi suggested that Congress's confidence after winning 99 seats in the recent Lok Sabha elections might have contributed to their loss in Haryana. ""In the intoxication of '99' and the arrogance of believing power is theirs by right, they should abandon the mindset of a 'spoilt prince' that caused this 'accident.' The public views such accusations with suspicion,"" he said.Trivedi also targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's ""unofficial MP"" remark, arguing it jeopardizes democracy. He said, ""Congress's most prominent and energetic leader claimed he'd remain an unofficial MP. This party, with an unofficial PM for 10 years, still has an unofficial president and, possibly, an unofficial CM in Delhi. Yet they raise their voice against the official constitutional bodies of our country, putting democracy at risk.""The EC rejected Congress's allegations of irregularities in Haryana's recent elections, calling them ""baseless, misplaced, and devoid of facts."" The ECI urged Congress to stop making groundless accusations, warning that such claims could lead to public unrest and chaos.In a letter to Congress, the ECI advised the party to exercise caution and employ due diligence rather than repeatedly casting unfounded criticism on electoral processes . The ECI confirmed that each stage of the Haryana election was flawless and observed by Congress candidates or their agents.Regarding concerns about the EVM battery display, the ECI clarified that the battery voltage and capacity are irrelevant to the machines' vote-counting function and integrity.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the inauguration of the C-295 aircraft manufacturing complex in Vadodara as a transformative milestone for India’s defence and aerospace sectors. The facility, developed through a collaboration between Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) and Airbus , represents the first private sector final assembly line for military aircraft in India.During the inauguratio on Monday, which was attended by Spanish President Pedro Sanchez, PM Modi emphasized the rapid progress of the project. In a LinkedIn post on Wednesday, he remarked, “The speed of execution is breathtaking— from foundation stone to operational facility in just two years! This is a clear manifestation of a new work culture and the capabilities of the people of India.”PM Modi provided a snapshot of the booming defence industry, highlighting that defence production surged to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2023-24, and exports rose dramatically from Rs 1,000 crore in 2014 to Rs 21,000 crore this year. He noted the indigenization of over 12,300 items within three years and mentioned an investment of over Rs 7,500 crore in domestic vendors by Defence Public Sector Undertakings.The Prime Minister outlined the comprehensive transformation of India's defence ecosystem, saying, “Our complete defence ecosystem is being transformed with indigenous warships patrolling our waters, made-in-India missiles strengthening our deterrence, and domestically produced bulletproof jackets protecting our soldiers.” He reiterated India's commitment to becoming self-reliant in defence while striving to emerge as a leading manufacturer of defence equipment on the global stage.PM Modi attributed this progress to the skills of the ""Yuva Shakti"" (youth power) and the initiatives of his government, which have contributed to reduced import dependency, job creation in the defence manufacturing sector, and skill development for the youth. He encouraged startups, manufacturers, and innovators to seize opportunities in India’s defence sector, stating, “This is your moment to be part of history. India needs your expertise and enthusiasm. The doors are open for innovation, the policies are supportive, and the opportunity is unprecedented.”In closing, he urged collective efforts to fortify India’s position as a self-reliant nation, declaring, “Together, let's build a stronger, self-reliant Bharat!”","PM Modi hailed the inauguration of the C-295 aircraft manufacturing complex in Vadodara as a transformative milestone for India’s defence and aerospace sectors.

"Close to 150 rebels in Maharashtra poll fray, pose challenge to MVA & Mahayuti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-to-150-rebels-in-maharashtra-poll-fray-pose-challenge-to-mva-mahayuti/articleshow/114750421.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Rebels threatened to become a headache for the two major alliances in the state as nominations for the assembly polls drew to a close Tuesday. While Mahayuti identified 80 rebels, close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's, or multi-party alliance's, official candidates. With Nov 4 being the last date for withdrawing nominations, the fronts have nearly a week to sort out differences and persuade rebels to pull out of the fray.Both the MVA and the Mahayuti said they had declared candidates for all 288 seats.After nominations closed, MVA had accounted for 286 of its nominees filing papers (103 from Congress - final figure for that party - 96 from Sena-UBT and 87 from Sharad Pawar-led NCP), with the three parties giving seats from their own quotas to smaller allies. In Mahayuti, the count came to 284 (BJ, Shiv Sena 80 and NCP 52), including smaller allies. Both alliances said the remaining seats would be accounted for once information came in from various parts of the state. However, from Mahayuti list, it appears it has declared two candidates in 5 constituencies, and none in two seats; it has declared 289 candidates in all.Among the prominent rebels are BJP's Gopal Shetty from Borivli who has filed papers against his party's official candidate Sanjay Upadhyay and NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal's nephew Sameer, who has filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Nandgaon assembly constituency in Nashik district against Shiv Sena MLA Suhas Kande.Prominent netas of Mahayuti and MVA admitted that the presence of rebels in the fray is a cause for concern and that they would have to tackle the matter. There is time still to do that: papers of candidates will be scrutinised on Wednesday and Nov 4 is the last date for withdrawal of candidatures. After that, a clear picture will emerge on the number of rebels still left in the fray.While the confusion that prevailed for a fortnight over who would contest how many seats more or less ended on Tuesday, significantly the Mahayuti, despite several rounds of talks, kept its seat-sharing formula secret throughout, while MVA's formula kept changing publicly. Initially, it was proposed that Congress would contest 103 seats, UBT Shiv Sena 90, and NCP (SP) 85. Later, UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut proposed a formula of 85 seats each, and since there was no consensus on that, Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat proposed a new formula, where all constituents of MVA would contest 90 seats each. The dispute was then taken to the court of the AICC, followed by separate meetings with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, after which the issue was resolved. ""There was no fixed formula; seats were decided based on merit and the winnability factor,"" a senior Congress politician said.State NCP president Sunil Tatkare said the seat-sharing formula of the Mahayuti was decided after considering all factors. ""We took note of the winnability factor. I am sure that the Mahayuti will retain power in the state,"" he said. Tatkare has convened a meeting of all senior leaders of his party on Wednesday to take stock of the political situation. ""We will meet our senior leaders to resolve intra-party disputes,"" Tatkare said.Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar was also confident of Mahayuti's win, saying selection of candidates was purely on merit and their ability to deliver and to tackle problems faced by the people. ""We will lead once again,"" Shelar said. Shelar felt the political picture in the state would be clear after the last date of withdrawal of nominations. ""We will know the exact number of candidates in the fray after the last date of withdrawal,"" he said.AICC secretary Ramesh Chennithala said that the people of Maharashtra would reject the ""corrupt"" Mahayuti govt led by Eknath Shinde.","Close to 150 politicians in all from across parties have filed nominations in defiance of their party's official candidates.

This occurred just before Canada expelled six Indian diplomats on October 13.Tensions between Canada and India have been high, especially after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the murder of a Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Drouin explained that the leak was part of a 'communications strategy' with deputy foreign minister David Morrison to ensure a major US publication presented Canada's stance on the foreign interference issue. Drouin added, ""the communications strategy was seen by the Prime Minister's Office.""""We provided non-classified information on the actions we had taken to cooperate with India and explain how the evidence showed links to the government of India conducting illegal activities against Canadians, including threats to their lives,"" Drouin said. She also affirmed that similar briefings were given to federal opposition leaders.Criticising the leak, Conservative party MP Raquel Dancho questioned why the information was not shared with the Canadian public and said, ""In fact, Canadians wouldn't know unless they were able to read The Washington Post. I just find it quite unfair to the Canadian public that details were released in advance to The Washington Post but not provided to Canada.""On October 14, RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme had said, ""India was involved in the killing of three people, but he only identified the slaying of Nijjar."" Duheme also mentioned that ""eight people have been charged with murder and 22 with extortion. Four Indian nationals have been charged in the killing of Nijjar outside a Sikh temple.""Duheme responded to these concerns by saying that the information could impact ongoing criminal investigations, stating, ""It is information as part of an investigation that normally we like to keep within but sometimes we do release some information.""India and Canada have faced ongoing diplomatic issues, including the recent recall of six Indian diplomats by India after Canada declared them ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar murder.Trudeau's allegations in the Canadian Parliament last year about India's involvement in Nijjar's killing have been firmly denied by India, which has described the accusations as 'absurd' and 'motivated.'NIA in India is currently investigating six cases involving designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who holds American and Canadian citizenship.","Canadian officials reportedly accepted leaking information about Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing to The Washington Post. This information was not shared with the Canadian public, as reported by The Globe and Mail.

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a huge shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

Cyberattacks: India Faces Catastrophic Cyberattack Surge: 17 Trillion Projections by 2047,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-faces-catastrophic-cyberattack-surge-17-trillion-projections-by-2047/articleshow/114744059.cms,"NEW DELHI: If left unchecked, India could attract nearly 1 trillion cyberattacks annually by 2033, and by the time it turns 100 in 2047, the country could be a target of 17 trillion cyberattacks, according to projections. Cybersecurity experts on Tuesday expressed concern at the increase in cases of cyberattacks and stressed the need for stronger measures to tackle the problem.Non-profit Prahar released a report indicating the urgent need for a robust, large-scale cyber defence apparatus.The report highlights how the rapid expansion in India's digital ecosystem leaves it open to risks. Cyberattacks on AIIMS and airlines by clandestine cyber entities are cases in point.In 2023, the country faced over 79 million cyberattacks, 15% more than in the previous year, ranking it third globally in terms of the number of such incidents. The escalation has continued into 2024. In the first quarter, there has been a sharp rise in cyberattacks, with over 500 million incidents in just three months. A recent report highlighted a 46% increase in cyberattacks in the second quarter than in the same period in 2023.This surge highlighted a growing need for stronger cybersecurity measures across industries, particularly in sectors increasingly targeted by cybercriminals. Globally, cyberattacks increased 76% in the first quarter of 2024, with India among the most affected countries. In the first four months of 2024, Indians lost more than Rs 1,750 crore to cybercriminals, reported through 7.4 lakh complaints on the NationalCybercrime Reporting Portal.Prahar's report, ‘The Invisible Hand', highlighted how critical infrastructure hacking and sophisticated manipulation of its citizens were core components of these new forms of vulnerabilities and attacks. It underlined the necessity of a well-planned, five-year national cybersecurity strategy and suggested that all IT-related infrastructure be consolidated under one organisation or ministry for focused efforts.The report also explores the dangers posed by betting and gaming apps with hidden, orchestrated strategies at play. ""There are two types of cyberattacks. The first involves traditional hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in systems for financial gain or disruption. The second, more insidious form targets citizens, recruiting them to engage in anti-national activities through manipulation, coercion, or threats,"" pointed out Abhay Mishra, president, Prahar.""Such tactics are most likely to be used on illegal betting apps. This tactic also resembles approaches deployed in Bangladesh, where adversaries managed to turn ordinary citizens into instruments of destabilisation, undermining govt institutions from within.""Retired IPS Muktesh Chander, former special commissioner, Delhi Police, said, ""A situation has arisen where not only individual hackers or disgruntled people, but also state-sponsored actors and states themselves are engaging in activities that sabotage important parameters of the economy.""","In 2023, the country faced over 79 million cyberattacks, 15% more than in the previous year.

The Election Commission should very seriously not only consider but take the initiative of taking this country back to paper ballots.

ECI warned that such irresponsible allegations could lead to public unrest and chaos, especially during sensitive times such as polling and counting days.Tewari also questioned the battery life of EVMs, expressing skepticism. He said, ""It absolutely defies any law of science that a machine, an EVM, can be in use for a whole day from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening or from 9 in the morning till 5 in the evening and have 99% battery life once the machine is powered down, it is stored in a strong room and then brought out a couple of days later and the votes are counted.""Addressing the issue from the Bharatiya Janata Party 's side, leader Tarun Chugh lambasted the Congress party , referring to it as a ""sinking ship"" and blamed it for questioning the efficacy of EVMs after electoral losses.Chugh commented, ""Congress is a sinking ship which is thoughtless and policy less...They blame the EVM for their loss (in the election). The Congress party, whenever it wins an election, whether it's in Karnataka or Telangana at that time, considers EVM and the election commission to be okay...Despite losing so many elections their ego is high.""","Congress MP Manish Tewari suggested that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should consider returning to paper ballots.

Earlier, ED had returned flats in Gurgaon to their owners who were allegedly cheated by real estate developers and refunded money to small investors who became victims of Kolkata’s Rose Valley chit fund ‘scam’.On Wednesday, ED said, “The directorate’s Chandigarh office has successfully returned properties valued over 185 crore from Surya Pharmaceuticals Ltd to the SBI-led consortium of banks through the official liquidator as part of its ongoing efforts to restore the proceeds of crime to the rightful victims and claimants of the offence of money laundering.”A special court in Chandigarh on Oct 25 allowed the sale of assets and its restitution to SBI, which had earlier filed a complaint of loan fraud of 829 crore against the accused. The court had also issued non-bailable warrants against directors Rajiv Goyal and Alka Goyal, who had fled the country and were subsequently declared proclaimed offenders in 2017, before ED could initiate its money laundering case.The restitution comes in record time, within six months of ED filing its charge-sheet against the accused Goyals in April. ED will soon move courts for declaring them as fugitives under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act to initiate their extradition to India.The restitution order came after ED held meetings with the lending banks and the official liquidator, appointed by the NCLT, assisting them in filing a restitution application before the special court in Chandigarh.","The attached assets include a building and superstructure on 80 kanals of land, along with plant and machinery, located in Samba in Jammu.

‘A large number in all parties’: Fadnavis admits rebel trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-large-number-in-all-parties-fadnavis-admits-rebel-trouble/articleshow/114791967.cms,"MUMBAI: Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday acknowledged the problem posed by rebel candidates , saying there is a large number of them in all parties. “Our efforts will be to persuade them to withdraw (from the fray),” he told reporters in Mumbai.When the MCC was announced, the Mahayuti coordination committee had announced that it would set up similar committees in every assembly constituency with representatives from all three parties. This was done to ensure that those not getting tickets could be persuaded not to rebel. However, the committees don’t seem to have worked.One of the biggest rebellions that has emerged is in Mumbai, with former MP Gopal Shetty raising the issue of locals versus outsiders within the party. Shetty has affirmed he will fight the polls as an Independent, although party functionaries are confident that they will be able to persuade him to pull out. BJP succeeded in ensuring that former MLAs from south Mumbai Raj Purohit and Atul Shah did not file papers as Independents. In Kothrud, it' is learnt that Amol Balwadkar, a BJP rebel candidate, declared his support for Chandrakant Patil, BJP’s official candidate, following a raid by I-T dept on his brother-in-law.Sanjay Patil, a researcher in dept of civics and politics at University of Mumbai, said BJP appears vulnerable and not confident of winning the polls. “In 2014, it fought on its own and emerged as the single largest party in the state. In 2019, despite an alliance with Sena, BJP’s seats went down from 122 to 105. It also failed to negotiate a deal with its oldest ally. For last five years, it could not have its CM in the state.”While the Haryana results buoyed the party in Maharashtra, observers said unless BJP can convince its workers that the CM will be from the party, they will not be inclined to work hard. “Elective merit is only point driving the polls. There is a complete absence of ideology and, hence, the large number of rebels,” said Ajay Vaidya, a political analyst.","Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis says there is a large number of rebel candidates in all parties.

Congress is likely to assure voters that Mahayuti govt’s Ladki Bahin Yojana providing monthly financial assistance to eligible women would not be discontinued. With the Mahayuti banking on the welfare schemes it had launched in the run up to the elections, Congress is likely to rely on the promises and programmes that helped it win Karnataka and Telangana assembly elections. In Telangana, Congress had declared loan waiver up to Rs 25 lakh for farmers, Rs 25 lakh health insurance, and time-bound plan for filling vacant govt posts, while in Karnataka, party had launched the Gruha Laxmi scheme, which is on the lines of Ladki Bahin Yojana.Meanwhile, maintaining that the alliance was intact, AICC general secretary Ramesh Chennithala said there was no dispute over the seat-sharing formula. “There will be no friendly contest in the state and MVA will secure a clear majority,” he added.

There will be no friendly contest and MVA will secure a clear majority,” Chennithala said.From media, he added, it appears there is complete confusion in Mahayuti over seat sharing as BJP has fielded candidates in seats held by Shinde’s Sena and Ajit’s NCP, marking beginning of BJP’s move to eliminate these two parties.Launching a frontal attack against Shinde-led Mahayuti govt, Chennithala said it is “one of the most corrupt govts” in the recent past.","Farm loan waiver, bigger govt health insurance and schemes focussed on women, farmers and youth are likely to be part of Congress manifesto.

This is how your parents can enrol for Ayushman scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-is-how-your-parents-can-enrol-for-ayushman-scheme/articleshow/114791550.cms,"Those aged 70 years and above can now benefit from the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana ( AB-PMJAY ) regardless of income, a major shift in the govt policy. Earlier, only poor and vulnerable families and a few specific categories of workers, like ASHA staff, were eligible for the scheme that offers health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary-care hospitalisation.Anyone aged 70 years or above can apply for the Ayushman Bharat Senior Citizen Scheme on the website, www.beneficiary.nha.gov.in, or by using the Ayushman App (available for Android on the Google Play Store). Beneficiaries simply need to verify their identity and eligibility through Aadhaar e-KYC . Aadhaar serves as the primary document for confirming both the beneficiary’s age and state of residence and is the only document required to complete the registration process.Yes. Family members can register the eligible an beneficiary through beneficiary login option on the mobile app and website. All they must do is to enter their mobile number and put in the OTP that’s generated to initiate the enrolment process. One can also visit the nearest empanelled hospital and get themselves enrolled.AB PM-JAY is a completely cashless scheme, and govt sources said payments are made to hospitals against the treatment provided to eligible beneficiaries. Empanelled hospitals are mandated to offer cashless treatment to beneficiaries. One can lodge grievances on the AB PM-JAY website or through the national call centre ‘14555’, mail, letter, fax etc. Any complaint regarding denial of treatment by an empaneled hospital is to be seen as an SOS grievance and a ‘turn around time’ of 6 hours has been set for resolving it.Such beneficiaries will have to re-initiate their Aadhaar based e-KYC via the website or mobile app to be registered as a beneficiary under the senior citizen scheme.The list of empanelled hospitals for Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme is available on the website www.dashboard.pmjay.gov.in. As of Sept 30, approximately 30,000 hospitals across the country are empanelled to provide benefits under the scheme, which is run overall by the National Health Authority. The list includes 190 leading corporate hospitals like Centre For Sight (Delhi), Medanta-The Medicity (Gurugram), Metro Hospital and Heart Institute (Noida), Fortis Escorts Hospital (Jaipur), Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital & Heart Institute (Ghaziabad), etc.Public health and hospitals being a state subject under the Indian Constitution, state health agencies (SHAs) are mandated to empanel hospitals under Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY.Beneficiaries can visit any empanelled hospital, present either their Ayushman card or their PMJAY ID to receive treatment. Before visiting, the beneficiary should confirm that the hospital is empanelled to treat the specific condition for which they require assistance.Nearly all treatments covered by the scheme cost below Rs 2 lakh and, so, the Rs 5 lakh cover is sufficient to meet beneficiaries’ healthcare needs, govt sources said. Further, under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance up to Rs 15 lakh is provided to patients from poor families — who are eligible for PM-JAY — for availing those treatments that are not covered under PM-JAY. Hence, AB PM-JAY along with other central govt schemes can take care of hospitalisation needs of eligible beneficiaries.No. With these states not implementing the scheme, elderly citizens cannot join or receive the benefits of AB PM-JAY.","Those aged 70 years and above can now benefit from the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.

On Dec 9, 2022, Chinese troops had tried to transgress across the LAC at Yangtse in the Tawang sector to unilaterally change the status quo, which had led to a major physical clash between the rival troops leaving several injured on both sides.Speaking at a ‘Barakhana’ at the 4 Corps HQ in Tezpur, even as India and China completed disengagement at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh on Wednesday, Singh said, “India and China were in diplomatic and military talks to resolve their conflicts in some areas along the LAC. We have reached a consensus following our continuous efforts.”“We achieved this success due to your discipline and courage,” Singh told soldiers, adding that the govt would continue this process of peace restoration on the basis of the consensus.“Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to say we can change our friends but not our neighbours. We believe in keeping cordial relations with our neighbours. This is India’s clear policy. However, sometimes situations arise and one has to ensure the safety and security of the borders. Keeping in mind the interests of our forces, the govt will take necessary steps in this process of peace restoration,” he said.Singh will visit Tawang on Thursday to inaugurate the Museum of Valour dedicated to Major Ralengnao Bob Khathing and unveil a statue of Sardar Patel.“The heroic deed of Major Ralengnao Bob Khathing, who bravely led an expedition in February 1951 to bring the Indian administration to Tawang, has no parallel in human history. What ‘Iron Man’ Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did as India’s first home minister by integrating several princely states into the country leaves us forever indebted to him,” Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu said on X. The two monuments dedicated to the great and brave souls will always remind people of their critical contribution to the country's integrity and sovereignty, Khandu said. In Tezpur, Singh was briefed by Army commanders on infrastructure development along the LAC and the employment of cutting-edge military equipment and technology to enhance operational efficiency.",India will continue process to restore peace along the Line of Actual Control on the basis of the consensus achieved with China.

This could enable a streamlined, paperless process for candidates to register, access, and complete exams, possibly even remotely.”While the committee was set up amid allegations of NEET-UG paper leak, it was entrusted to recommend comprehensive entrance exam reforms in the country. Against this backdrop, the committee in its phase 1 implementation, recommended five-point restructuring of NTA — empowered and accountable of governing body with eminent domain experts; strengthening of the agency with additional manpower; and 10 verticals of NTA encompassing research and development, test security, test centres infrastructure, and international collaboration, among others.The panel also recommended several measures to prevent breaches and malpractices in pen-paper test (PPT) and computer based test (CBT), biometric verification at all levels i.e., registration, test centre, and counselling and during admission time.The phase 2 or the long-term plan called for “collaboration with KV (Kendriya Vidyalayas), NV (Navodaya Vidyalayas), higher educational institute for developing state of the art digital and test centre (physical) infrastructure, empowering of higher secondary school system, and research in educational testing.The panel led by former Isro chief R Radhakrishnan, submitted its report to the govt last week. It also recommended major revamping of the National Testing Agency (NTA). According to govt sources, a total of 101 recommendations were made and are to be implemented in two phases.As first reported by TOI on July 19, 2024, the committee has recommended multi-stage testing for NEET along with a number of attempts along with “Hybrid Model” of testing to be implemented in pilot phase. This would include both CBT and PPT mode (where there are logistical issues for CBT).Apart from a robust grievances redressal system to address every grievance and communicate to all stakeholders in a timely manner, the committee also recommended an oversight mechanism over coaching centres, as well as detailed recommendations for social inclusiveness of socially disadvantaged groups and rural background students.","The panel also called for multi-stage testing for the medical entrance – National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ( NEET ) along with number of attempts and suitable oversight mechanism over coaching centres.

Canada had said it “expelled” the diplomats after India refused to waive their diplomatic immunity.Canadian NSA Nathalie Drouin told a parliamentary panel on Tuesday that information was leaked to the newspaper to counter alleged disinformation by India and it was a “strategic decision to engage a respected international news outlet that had already published on the subject to ensure the record was straight”. Canada’s Globe and Mail had carried a report identifying Drouin and deputy foreign minister David Morrison as officials who briefed the newspaper.One of the allegations mentioned in the Post report was that India’s home minister Amit Shah had authorised attacks on Canadian Sikhs — pro-Khalistani separatists — in the country. Morrison, who was also present at the parliamentary hearing, admitted he had “confirmed” Shah’s alleged involvement to the Post reporter.He also said he had not on his own shared that information but only confirmed it when the reporter asked him about it. “The journalist called me and asked if it was that person. I confirmed it was that person,” Morrison told the panel, without elaborating.Morrison had been asked by Raquel Dancho, MP of opposition Conservative Party, who during the hearing raised the issue of Trudeau govt passing on information to the Post.While there was no official response by India to Canada’s public naming of Shah, govt sources here maintained that these latest assertions by Canadian authorities were again not backed by any evidence. A Reuters report quoted anonymous govt sources as saying Canada’s claim was based on “very weak and flimsy” evidence.India has maintained since the allegations first surfaced, in the form of a statement made by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in Parliament last year, about the involvement of Indian officials in a murder-for-hire plot that Ottawa has shared no evidence or actionable information to back its claims.Canada's NSA Nathalie Drouin also said Canadian and Indian security officials had met at least seven times since Aug last year and claimed that Canada had “evidence” about the involvement of Indian officials in gathering information through coercion and threats. “This information is then shared with senior levels of the government of India who then direct the commission of serious criminal activities against Indo-Canadians to the kinetic views of the Lawrence Bishnoi organised crime network,” she said.

But it may turn ‘severe’ on these days if additional emissions from firecrackers and stubble or waste fires add to the city’s pollution.The day’s average Air Quality Index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 307 at 4pm, with two stations (Anand Vihar and Mundka) reporting severe air quality. It added that winds may vary from four to 20 kmph on Diwali with the possibility of mist in the morning and a mainly clear sky. The wind speed will drop a day after Diwali.Anand Vihar had the worst air quality in the city on Wednesday with an AQI of 407, followed by Mundka at 401. The city’s AQI, however, kept worsening towards late evening due to calm winds.“The air quality may reach the severe category on Oct 31 and Nov 01 in case of additional emissions from firecrackers and stubble/waste fires. Outlook for the subsequent six days: Very poor to severe,” stated IITM's air quality early warning system.A day earlier (Tuesday), the city’s average AQI was 268, in the poor zone. An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered poor, 301 to 400 very poor, while a value between 401 and 500 is considered severe.As per IITM’s Decision Support System (DSS), while the share of stubble burning in the city’s PM2.5 levels increased slightly to 3.4% on Tuesday, against 1.8% on Monday, it was still low and local sources had more impact on the city’s air quality. The DSS shares display the actual share of stubble burning for the previous day.On Wednesday, transport remained the major source of pollution in the city, contributing 16.2% of all pollution, followed by pollution coming from Gautam Budh Nagar (7.4%), Faridabad (7.3%), Ghaziabad (4.3%), residential emissions (4.2%), industries (3.7%), Gurgaon (3.5%), and construction sector (2.1%).According to CPCB, PM2.5 levels on Wednesday oscillated between 104 to 166.6 micrograms per cubic metre – rising as the day proceeded, while the national safe standard for PM2.5 is 60 units, and the WHO has set the limit at 15 units for 24 hours.","The day’s average Air Quality Index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 307 at 4pm.

"After 4.5 years, India to resume patrols in Demchok, Depsang",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-4-5-years-india-to-resume-patrols-in-demchok-depsang/articleshow/114790463.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army will begin initial patrols on Thursday to a few places where its access was blocked by Chinese troops in the Depsang and Demchok areas of eastern Ladakh for the last four and a half years, in a significant development that India hopes will eventually lead to de-escalation along the entire Line of Actual Control.The resumption of patrolling will come after the two armies on Wednesday completed the phased disengagement and verification process, both physically on the ground as well as through aerial surveillance by drones and satellites, at the two remaining face-off sites in the Depsang Plains and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok.“The aerial verification of Demchok was completed on Wednesday morning after getting delayed by a day due to bad weather. In the evening, the rival ground commanders met at two points in Depsang and one at Demchok for the final confirmation of the dismantling of temporary posts and structures as well as the mutual pullback of troops to pre-April 2020 positions,” a top defence source told TOI.With the 10-day disengagement and verification going off without a major hitch, the Army will “launch some initial patrolling on Thursday and progressively expand it to full-fledged patrols to all areas over the coming days and weeks”, he added.The thaw in the bone-chilling conditions in the high-altitude region will be marked by the exchange of sweets between the rival troops at several locations to mark Diwali on Thursday.The yawning trust deficit, however, will take time to bridge. “A close watch will be kept on the People’s Liberation Army to ensure its does not renege from the pact on the coordinated Depsang-Demchok patrolling arrangements announced on Oct 21, under which each side will inform the other in advance about its patrols to prevent clashes,” said another source.While ground commanders of the rank of Brigadiers and below will continue to meet regularly to discuss modalities as before, sources said the next major step will be for rival corps commanders of Lieutenant General-rank to meet after the situation stabilises in Depsang-Demchok to discuss the resumption of patrolling rights in the “buffer zones” created earlier.The ‘no-patrol’ buffer zones after the earlier disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3km to 10km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.“These buffer zones with patrolling restrictions, with the last one coming up in Sept 2022, were supposed to be temporary arrangements. Our troops will now get unhindered access to their five traditional patrolling points (PPs) in Depsang and two in Demchok since no buffer zones have been created there. But the question of the earlier buffer zones also needs to be resolved,” the source said.There is no longer any eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in eastern Ladakh, with the disengagement now taking place in the last two of the seven major face-off points that arose after PLA’s multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020 that caught India completely off guard. This will, hopefully, ensure there is no sudden inadvertent vertical escalation on the ground.The rival armies, however, continue to be ranged against each other all along the 3,488km LAC, with over 50,000 troops from each side forward deployed with tanks, howitzers, surface-to-air missiles and the like in eastern Ladakh.Another 90,000 PLA troops are similarly forward deployed across Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, with “matching mirror deployments” by India. Talks are also under way to ease the tensions in “sensitive” areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh, as reported by TOI earlier.In eastern Ladakh, India wants China to agree to the sequential process of disengagement being followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of forward deployed troops. “The Chinese threat will remain till there is de-induction,” a senior official said.",The resumption of patrolling will come after the two armies on Wednesday completed the phased disengagement and verification process. The thaw in the bone-chilling conditions in the high-altitude region will be marked by the exchange of sweets between the rival troops on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114790497,imgsize-1783262,width-400,resizemode-4/114790497.jpg"

Two threat messages were received on the city traffic police's WhatsApp helpline around 10am, and within hours, Worli police tracked down the sender — Bandra West resident Azam Mohammed Mustafa (56), who was earlier employed as a production manager in Saudi Arabia— and arrested him.The arrest comes a day after Mumbai Police apprehended Mohammed Tayyab alias Gufran Khan (20) from Noida for allegedly making a call and sending messages to Zeeshan's office helpline in Bandra (E), claiming that he overheard people planning to kill him and Salman, to expecting the MLA to reward him for providing the ‘death threat' information.Police said that like Tayyab, Mustafa too has no criminal record. ""We are questioning Mustafa to find out why he sent the two threat messages,"" said a senior police officer.Police have seized Mustafa's phone and will send it for forensic analysis. The first message received on the traffic police helpline said that if Salman and Zeeshan want to save their lives, they should pay Rs 2 crore. The message further said, ""Don't take this lightly, or you'll know on Oct 31."" In the second message, the accused said that it was not a prank and mentioned the assassination of NCP leader Baba Siddique outside his son Zeeshan's office on Oct 12. Mustafa, who lives with his wife and son, has been remanded in police custody for one day.Last week, Worli police had arrested Shaikh Hussain (24), a vegetable vendor from Jamshedpur, for allegedly sending threat messages to Mumbai Traffic Police's WhatsApp helpline on Oct 18, demanding Rs 5 crore. The message included a threat that Salman's ""condition will be worse than Baba Siddique"" if the demand wasn't met. Two days later, Shaikh sent a text apologising for the threat message.In the past, Salman has received several death threats from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang members, who also opened fire at his Bandra residence in April. The actor's security was enhanced, but the situation got serious when his close friend, Baba Siddique, was shot dead allegedly by Bishnoi men on Oct 12.","Two threat messages were received on the city traffic police's WhatsApp helpline around 10am.
