""It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it.""He was apparently referring to Hasina's statement on Aug 13 in which she demanded ""justice"", saying those involved in recent ""terror acts"", killings and vandalism must be investigated, identified and punished. This has been the only statement made by her after she fled to India following unprecedented anti-govt protests that peaked on Aug 5. It was posted by her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed Joy on X.When asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its stance to India, Yunus said it has been conveyed verbally. ""Everyone understands it. We have said quite firmly that she should keep quiet. This is an unfriendly gesture towards us; she has been given shelter there and she is campaigning from there. It is not that she has gone there on a normal course. She has fled following a people's uprising and public anger,"" he said.Yunus stated that the interim govt is committed to ensuring justice for the people of Bangladesh against the atrocities, and justice requires that she be brought back to the country. ""...Or else the people of Bangladesh won't be at peace."" The kind of atrocities she has committed, she has to be tried in front of everyone here.""

Putin: India could be mediator on Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/putin-india-could-be-mediator-on-ukraine/articleshow/113108442.cms,"Kremlin: 'No specific plans' on Modi mediating on Ukraine issue

Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday said he was constantly in touch with India, China and Brazil over the Ukraine war, adding these countries were making efforts to resolve the conflict. An agency report from Vladivostok quoted him as saying these countries could potentially act as mediators.""If there is a desire of Ukraine to carry on with the negotiations, I can do that.We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India,"" Putin said at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.Separately, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia daily that India could help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine. Underlining the ""highly constructive, even friendly relations"" between Modi and Putin, he said the Indian PM could ""lead the line on getting first-hand information from the participants in this conflict"" as he ""freely communicates with Putin, with Zelensky, and with the Americans"".PM Modi had travelled to Moscow in July, where he told Putin that the conflict could not be resolved on the battlefield, and followed it up with a visit to Kyiv last month during which he reiterated India's willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.On his return, Modi spoke to Putin and conveyed to him India's readiness to actively support any political or diplomatic settlement.PM Modi's rapport with Putin, Zelensky and the US ""gives a great opportunity for India to throw its weight in world affairs, to use its influence that would drive the Americans and Ukrainians towards using a greater political will and entering the peaceful settlement track"", Kremlin spokesman Peskov said.However, India has continued to maintain that it won't initiate any peace process on its own and will mediate only if asked to. India has also insisted that enduring peace is possible only if both sides are involved in any initiative.For India to play any role though, it's important that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also agrees. He had suggested during Modi's visit that India could consider hosting the next peace summit but then effectively ruled India out as he asserted that only a country that endorsed the joint communique at the first summit could play host. India had not taken part in the first summit since Russia was not invited.Peskov also said there were ""no specific plans"" on Modi mediating on the issue. ""At this time they can hardly exist, as we do not see any preconditions for talks for now,"" the Kremlin spokesman said. Modi on Aug 23 visited Ukraine where he conveyed to Zelensky that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the war and that India was ready to play an ""active role"" to restore peace in the region.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was constantly in touch with India, China and Brazil over the Ukraine war.

Ganesh Fest: Ganesh Festival 2024: Toll-Free Rides on Maharashtra Highways from Sept 5-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ganesh-fest-toll-free-rides-on-major-hways-for-15-days/articleshow/113072955.cms,"MUMBAI: In what is seen as a move to avoid embarrassment over the condition of roads during Ganpati festival, the state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways across the state from Sept 5-19. But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too. Some officials acknowledged that with even these precautions, motorists could still be charged. ""If a FasTag sticker gets read and the toll gets deducted, one can make a cashback request through the FasTag bank account, following which the amount will be refunded,"" said a senior MSRDC official.The toll exemption directive covers all entry points of Mumbai (Vashi, Airoli, Mulund, LBS and Dahisar), barring Bandra-Worli Sea Link, NH-48 (Mumbai-Bengaluru), NH-66 (Mumbai-Goa), and other PWD and MSRDC roads. It applies to Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses as well, said a govt resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday, which said the move is targeted at devotees travelling during Ganesh festival. Samruddhi Mahamarg will also implement the GR, said officials. There was no clarity on whether MTHL is covered under the directive.Toll exemption passes will be issued to MSRTC buses with the vehicle number and driver's name. These will be coordinated by the transport department, traffic police, police and regional transport offices (RTO) and made available at police stations, traffic police checkpoints and RTO offices. The passes will also be valid for the return journey, the GR said.","The state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways from Sept 5-19.

Teachers’ Day, celebrated annually across India on September 5, also marks the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher, scholar, exemplary teacher, and politician. As the first Vice President and the second President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan dedicated his life to education and shaping the youth of the country, making significant contributions that remain exemplary to this day.When his students and friends wanted to celebrate his birthday, he humbly suggested that the day be observed as Teachers' Day instead, recognizing the vital role of teachers in society.Since 1962, this day has been a tribute to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan’s enduring legacy and to all teachers who work tirelessly to educate and inspire students. His philosophy and words continue to offer profound lessons for students , emphasising the importance of critical thinking, creativity, and a deeper understanding of human nature and spirituality. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's insights encourage students to become resilient, independent thinkers and compassionate individuals, highlighting the transformative power of education in shaping one's character and purpose.Here are four lessons students can learn from Radhakrishnan's immortal lines:""The end product of education should be a free creative man, who can battle against historical circumstances and adversities of nature.""Dr. Radhakrishnan’s words reflect that education is an immensely powerful tool that can arm human beings with the wisdom to fight against challenging circumstances by shaping their free, creative spirit.Make sure that you acquire the right skills, such as critical thinking and adaptability from what you are taught at school.Read More: Teachers' Day 2024: President Murmu to Honour Educators with National Awards Today ""True teachers are those who help us think for ourselves.""A teacher is a source of not only knowledge or wisdom but also inspiration.

This will evoke curiosity and help you derive joy out of what you learn.""Man is a paradoxical being- the constant glory and scandal of this world.""These words by Dr. Radhakrishnan highlight the fact that human beings are born with conflicting capabilities. While they can make the world a glorious place to live in and be proud of, mankind also harbours the capacity to fill it with scandalous filth.Take everything with a pinch of salt. Make sure that your interactions with other humans are open yet guarded.","Teachers' Day, celebrated annually across India on September 5, also marks the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher, scholar, exemplary teacher, and politician.

KOLKATA: The Trinamool students' union on Monday suspended Avik De , the first-year PGT doctor at SSKM surgery department, following allegations of his presence at the R G Kar crime scene on Aug 9. The 'suspension with immediate effect till the probe', as announced by TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharjee, comes in the wake of IMA Bengal doctors identifying De as the man in a red t-shirt among those standing near the victim's body, as seen in a leaked video .The TMCP step flies in the face of cops' insistence the man in red shirt is a fingerprint expert.What may have also led to the TMCP decision is an audio clip, in which De is purportedly heard bragging about his presence at the crime scene. Sources said the hour-long audio was a recording of his address to Burdwan Medical College students on Aug 11. Sources said a student recorded his lecture. TOI accessed the audio clip in which a man, claimed to be De, is heard saying he was at RG Kar on Aug 9 right after the body was found. He claimed to have seen the entire CCTV footage and that the civic volunteer was the only person involved in the crime.TOI tried to contact De but he did not respond.Burdwan Medical College junior doctors and students gheraoed the college council members, demanding De and other doctors allegedly part of ' North Bengal lobby ' be barred from the campus. The gherao was on till last report came in.After questions were raised on the presence of unauthorised persons at the crime scene and photos of it appeared, KP identified the man in a red shirt, standing in the cordoned-off area, as a fingerprint expert and that no one beyond the probe team was present. But a day later, IMA Bengal said it was De. ""On Aug 11, De visited Burdwan Medical College and called 100-odd students to the lecture hall, where he said he was at the crime scene from the beginning of the probe,"" said a junior doctor. ""He dropped CP and CM's names, trying to convince us about a fair probe. He said Sandip Ghosh was innocent. He tried to persuade as well as intimidate us not to join the agitation.""An alumnus of North Bengal Medical College, De was an RMO-cum-clinical tutor at the Burdwan college till he got the SSKM seat.

We want the political parties not to extend their pressure to the family and take political advantage. We have seen the opposition parties do vulture politics over dead bodies in the past. We want to appeal to them this is not the time for such politics. We are all together in pursuit of justice,"" West Bengal minister Shashi Panja said.The family of the victim, which joined the protest at the RG Kar Hospital on Wednesday night, have accused the police of trying to offer them money when they were crying and sitting with the mortal remains of their daughter. ""When the body of the daughter was lying in front of the parents in the house, the police were offering money, is this the humanity of the police?"" the aunt of the deceased doctor had said yesterday.The Trinamool Congress, meanwhile, accused the BJP of exacerbating the distress of the victim's parents by politicising the issue. ""The BJP is not seeking justice, but only trying to use the tragedy for political gains,"" the minister said. Panja emphasised that the victim's parents are solely seeking justice, and urged that politics should not interfere with this pursuit.""When everyone is crying for justice including the Trinamool Congress, politics should not come into play. We want speedy justice and exemplary punishment for the culprit or culprits,"" Panja said, adding the CBI is currently investigating the case, and the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident.The Trinamool Congress also questioned the delay in investigations on the part of CBI, which is probing the case on the instructions of Calcutta high court. West Bengal education minister and senior TMC leader Bratya Basu said despite Kolkata Police handing over all relevant documents to the CBI 23 days ago, there has been no significant progress or communication from the agency. He questioned the CBI's lack of transparency and the BJP's claims of evidence tampering.""The BJP has been saying that evidence has been tampered with. We want to know what evidence had been tampered with. Why this silence on the part of the CBI?"" he asked.The BJP, however, hit back at chief minister Mamata Banerjee and accused her police of spreading fake news. ""Earlier, Kolkata police was sending summons to the people saying that they are spreading fake news. Now, we can see that Kolkata police itself was spreading fake news regarding the renovation work that was carried out at the hospital immediately after the incident. The CM should be inquired first to get to the truth. It was an organised crime and Sandip Ghosh has big names with him,"" BJP leader Locket Chatterjee said. The party has kept the pressure on the West Bengal government and has demanded the resignation of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.(With inputs from agencies)","Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal asks opposition not to do ""vulture politics over a dead body"" Accuses BJP of exacerbating distress of victim's parents by politicising the issue.

Modi unveiled the Shivaji statue in Dec 2023 and it collapsed on Aug 26 and the PM tendered an apology during his recent visit to Maharashtra.Rahul said, ""I want to understand the reasons for his (PM's) apology. It could be because he accepts that it was a mistake to give the contract for the statue's installation to an RSS-linked person. The other reason could be that he has accepted that there was corruption in the installation. His apology to Shivaji Maharaj is not enough, he should apologise to the citizens of Maharashtra.""Rahul reiterated his accusations that the Modi-led govt helps industrialists like Adani and Ambani. ""Youth are facing unemployment crisis. The Adanis and Ambanis are not going to create employment. Small and medium-scale industries could have but Modi destroyed them to help two industrialists.

His father Mumtaz takes pride in the fact that clients speak highly of the quality of their products.Besides military badges, artisans of Lallapura also receive orders from fashion houses to create customised items. The primary materials that go into the making of badges and insignias are zari, a combination of gold and silver threads, and silk.The craft got a boost in 2014 when zardozi was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.""GI certification provides legal safeguards for traditional knowledge and enables artisans to market their work better,"" says GI expert and Padma Shri winner Rajani Kant.","Lallapura has about 200 artisans skilled in making hand-embroidered military and royal emblems, crests, insignias for uniforms, cap badges, trimmings, and other decorative elements.

Forces poised to shed more 'vestiges of colonial era',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forces-poised-to-shed-more-vestiges-of-colonial-era/articleshow/113105127.cms,"NEW DELHI: After taking several steps in line with the government’s directive to shed “vestiges of the colonial era” and “Indianise” military traditions and customs, ranging from junking of western tunes in the Beating Retreat ceremony to the introduction of kurta-pyjamas in naval messes, the armed forces are now poised for some more measures.The country’s military brass not only discussed theatre commands, modernization and regional and geopolitical threats during the two-day joint commanders conference (JCC), but also apparently dwelt upon the need to create a new legacy in the 14-lakh strong armed forces.Defence minister Rajnath Singh , in fact, released a publication on ‘Colonial Practises and the Armed Forces - A Review’ during the conference in Lucknow , which was attended by chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan , the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs, and the commanders-in-chief of all the 17 single-service and two tri-service commands in the country.“The publication outlines the methodology and means to create a new legacy in the armed forces based on indigenous customs, traditions, values and thought. It has also highlighted specific leftover vestiges of colonial symbols and traditions which have been discarded and replaced with Indian practices,” a senior officer told TOI.Citing PM Modi’s enunciation of the ‘Panch Pran (five pledges)’, including 'Gulami ki Mansikta Se Mukti' (freedom from slavery mentality), to ensure India becomes a developed country by 2047, the officer said the armed forces are but a microcosm of the larger Indian society.The soldiers, sailors and airmen carry their societal values, vision and aspirations into the armed forces. “Being the most conservative and traditions based service, the armed forces require a larger and deeper effort to discard the shackles of archaic thinking and emerge free of colonial influences,” he said.Several serving military officers and veterans, however, feel that such relentless drives, policies and seminars are unnecessarily diverting the attention of the armed forces from the clear and present danger posed by China and its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan. “The focus should only be on modernization and training for future wars,” an officer said.Another officer questioned the operational utility of the `Udbhav’ project of the Army, which seeks to integrate India’s ancient strategic acumen with contemporary military practices, for instance, in the era of AI-based swarm drones and advanced unmanned combat, space and cyber warfare, ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons. “The armed forces should be looking at the future, instead of being forced to dwell on the past,” he said.","The country’s military brass discussed theatre commands, modernization and regional and geopolitical threats during the two-day joint commanders conference (JCC) Defence minister Rajnath Singh released a publication on ‘Colonial Practises and the Armed Forces - A Review’ during the conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113105141,imgsize-1862169,width-400,resizemode-4/113105141.jpg"

Future ties with India

On attacks on Hindus

NEW DELHI: Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday expressed his displeasure with former prime minister Sheikh Hasina 's political remarks made from India.In a recent interview with PTI, Yunus said that Hasina's statements are an ""unfriendly gesture"" and that she must remain silent until Dhaka requests her extradition .""If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh (government) wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet,"" he said.""No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it. It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,"" he added.While stressing Bangladesh's desire to keep strong ties with its neighbour, Yunus also advised India to refrain from framing everybody except Hasina as Islamist.""The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only,"" Yunus said.""India is captivated by this narrative. India has to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,"" he added.Speaking about future ties with India, the Nobel laureate said there are demands for a relook at certain treaties such as transit and the Adani electricity deal.""Everybody is saying that it is needed. We will see what is on paper and, second, what is actually happening on the ground. I can't answer it specifically. If there is any need to review, we will then raise questions about it,"" he said.Earlier, the BNP vowed to review and re-evaluate the ""questionable"" Adani electricity deal signed during the Awami League regime, as it is putting ""tremendous pressure"" on the people of Bangladesh.Yunus refuted alleged violence against minorities in Bangladesh and claimed that India's concerns were 'exaggerated' .""The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse,"" he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and said that 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.On August 5, Bangladesh plunged into a political crisis after PM Sheikh Hasina suddenly fled to India after weeks of nationwide protests turned violent in which at least 300 people were killed.The protests, initially ignited by students opposing a government employment quota system, rapidly evolved into widespread demonstrations against Hasina's administration due to allegations of corruption, economic mismanagement, and harsh crackdown on dissent. The discontent among the population was exacerbated by rising inflation and economic challenges, similar to those faced by neighbouring countries.","Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday expressed his displeasure with former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's political remarks made from India.

NEW DELHI: Captain Devi Sharan — the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019 — and Captain S P S Suri — the pilot flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on Jan 1, 2000, — had another tryst with danger 12 years later. This time the two and their cabin crew member colleagues got stuck in civil-war torn Libya and were waylaid by AK 47-totting youngsters on the streets of the city.Luckily, they escaped unhurt.India had launched “Operation Safe Homecoming” in Feb 2011 to evacuate its citizens fleeing the Libyan civil war. Captains Sharan and Suri had operated an Air India Airbus A330 to Sabha in Libya which got grounded on arrival due to a snag. “The city, and the entire country, was seeing serious unrest. Somehow escorts were arranged to take us from the airport to an abandoned hotel in the city. There was no staff there and we had to search for something to eat in the kitchen,” Captain Suri, now retired, told TOI. Captain Sharan still flies for AI, now the Boeing 787.Captain Sharan had also spoken to TOI about this episode in an interview three years ago.“The next day, again with armed escorts, we went to the city to look for food. On the way, we were stopped by armed people and asked to lie down on the road. Our escorts explained that we were airline staff from India and had got stuck there. Then the machine gun-totting youngsters let us go,” said Suri. The food hunt did not go well either — there was only camel meat in the market which the Indian crew did not take. Indian diplomats arranged pizzas, again only tuna fish pizzas with no veg option to be found, for them.Two days later when a replacement part was sent for the grounded aircraft and the same was fir to fly, the two daredevil pilots took off for what was to be a nonstop flight to Delhi. This journey was also not without its share of last-minute surprises.“Enroute, Lebanon refused us overflying. We had to turn back and then took Egypt permission to overfly. Then we went to Saudi Arabia; took a fuelling halt in Jeddah and then came to Delhi,” recalled Suri. The two pilots go back a long way and their chemistry helped come out of this situation too. This had happened when the 2011 cricket World Cup, which India won, was between Feb 19 and April 2, 2011. India had won that cup.On the fateful Dec 2019, Captain Sharan and Captain Suri had taken off almost simultaneously from Dubai (for Kandahar) and Sharjah (for Calicut), respectively, in the early hours of Christmas. “We had come to know about IC 814 hijacking while on the ground in Sharjah. While operating these flights, I spoke to Captain Sharan on RT (radio telephony) and asked himhow are you. He had replied, ‘Sir, I can’t talk’,” Suri said.On landing in Delhi from Calicut later that day, Captain Suri from the airport left for Kandahar along with a team of officials and IA staff including Captain J R D Rao whose bravery he recalls with tremendous admiration.On Dec 31, 1999, everyone onboard IC 814 including Captain Sharan were flown back to Delhi. Captain Suri, J R D Rao and two others stayed in Kandahar as they were to fly the hijacked Airbus A330 back home, which they did the next morning in true daredevil style. The old saying luck favours the brave proved to be correct for them.“On Jan 1, we decided to give it a try and start the engines of IC 814 without any ground power. Luckily the engine started with a growl after seven days and we started taxiing. The Kandahar air traffic control asked us to stop and told us we did not have take off clearance. There was a fuel bowser close to our aircraft and I was worried one side wing of the aircraft might hit it. Captain Rao, who had a sore throat and could barely speak, told me, ‘keep going)Suri said.They took off from Kandahar with Afghan ATC shouting they did not have permission to do so. Shortly thereafter they entered Pakistan airspace, where also they were told they did not have the same. “I just kept saying hello, hello, can’t hear or something like that. We had butterflies in out stomach that Pakistan will scramble jets and force us to land. That did not happen.”The four members heaved a sigh of relief when they heard from “alpha control” — Amritsar ATC welcome IC-814 D (delayed) to India and tell them they had a straight routing clear for India.","Captain Devi Sharan was the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019. Captain S P S Suri flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on Jan 1, 2000.

This is despite a gazette notification of the NMC in Aug last year that reiterated that the commission would continue to follow the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, which give patients the right to an appeal against state council decisions.The Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of the NMC had issued a gazette notification on Aug 23, 2023 stating that the NMC ""hereby adopts and makes effective with immediate effect the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, as if the same have been made by the commission by virtue of the powers vested under the NMC Act , 2019"". It goes on to reiterate: ""That for removal of doubt, it is clarified the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 shall come into force with immediate effect"".Section 8.8 of the 2002 regulations states: ""Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council.""However, a patient in Chennai who filed an appeal recently against the state medical council decision in a case of alleged medical negligence was told by NMC that ""as per existing NMC Act 2019, only registered medical practitioners can apply on first appeal in NMC"". On Tuesday, the complainant was informed by the ethics section of the NMC that section 8.8 of the 2002 Regulations were abolished on Sep 25, 2020 after all the provisions of the NMC Act, 2019 came into force.This is not the first time the NMC is doing this. In response to an RTI application in 2022 seeking data on the number of patients' appeals rejected by the NMC, it admitted that 65 appeals of patients were returned from March to Sep 2022 due to their non-maintainability under section 30(3) of the NMC Act. Unlike 8.8 of the 2002 regulations, which states that anyone can appeal, this section states that ""a medical practitioner or professional who is aggrieved by any action taken by a State Medical Council"" can appeal to the EMRB.""Though the NMC has been in office for about four years, EMRB is repeatedly rejecting the appeals by patients against the state medical councils' decisions. It continues to do that despite EMRB's gazette notification reiterating that the 2002 regulations are in force, which means that patients have a right to appeal.

He said such linkages compound the suspicions about her ability to function as an independent regulator in view of past allegations.Chakravarty said 500 Sebi employees have openly termed the working environment in the market regulator as ""toxic and fearful"", but Sebi reacted by running down the employees as motivated by outsiders. He said Sebi is demeaning its own officers, and challenged it to sack the employees if they could be motivated by outside entities.Recalling the allegations that Buch was receiving ""salary"" and ""income"" from ICICI Bank as Sebi member and chair, the Congress functionary said it was intriguing that the lender chose to speak on her behalf while the latter stayed away from commenting. He said it was starkly different from the past when ICICI Bank had responded to allegations against its CEO Chanda Kochar by ordering an independent inquiry, which later found her culpable.Chakravarty differentiated between ""salary"", that Congress had used in its allegations, and ""income"", and said Puri's earnings from ESOPs were from ICICI whose stocks are regulated by Sebi, which demonstrates a ""clear conflict of interest"".As a former finance professional, Chakravarty said he has received several calls from foreign investors who raised questins about the integrity of the market regulator.

The day before, he had filed his papers for the family stronghold of Ganderbal , where the race intensified with some contestants apparently complicating matters for Omar.Both constituencies will vote in the second phase of the three-leg elections on Sept 25.As an explanation for contesting from a second constituency, Omar said: “The contest from Budgam shows NC is not weak. It is proof of our power. Had there been any risk in fighting polls from Budgam, my party colleagues would not have recommended me to contest. There is a wave for NC in every nook and cranny of J&K.”He predicted that NC and alliance partner Congress would be voted to office. The new assembly would make the world aware of “decisions taken against J&K and its people in the past five years”, the former CM said.Omar’s decision drew criticism from political opponents. “If Omar Abdullah truly believes the people are with him, he would not have felt the need to contest from two constituencies. His decision shows a clear lack of confidence,” PDP’s Ghulam Nabi Lone said.According to sources, at least three factors might have influenced Omar’s decision. “In Ganderbal, Omar is facing dissent from a section of NC workers seeking a local candidate. He also faces a tough, multi-pronged fight in Ganderbal. His prospects appear better in Budgam, where he led in votes during his Lok Sabha defeat to independent candidate Engineer Rashid,” said a source.Baramulla MP Rashid’s Awami Ittehad Party has fielded former Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq as an independent candidate in Ganderbal. Former CM Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP has nominated Bashir Ahmad Mir.Adding to the competition is jailed separatist cleric Sarjan Ahmad Barkati, who had his nomination papers for Zainapora in south Kashmir rejected. Barkati has now opted to contest from Ganderbal, traditionally an NC bastion. The Abdullah family has represented Ganderbal since 1977, beginning with party founder Sheikh Abdullah , followed by his son Farooq Abdullah, and later Omar, who won the seat in 2008 after losing it in 2002.Omar has faced criticism for participating in the elections after earlier announcing that he would abstain until J&K’s full statehood was restored. He later admitted: “Staying out of the elections was a mistake. Seeking votes from the people while not being a candidate myself seemed contradictory.”These elections will be the first since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh. The NC-Congress campaign focuses on the restoration of J&K’s statehood — a demand that resonates across both Kashmir and Jammu.","National Conference ( NC ) vice president Omar Abdullah submitted his nomination papers from Budgam in central Kashmir.

Sonu: Dad goes extra mile with 2-yr-old for better future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dad-goes-extra-mile-with-2-yr-old-for-better-future/articleshow/113104221.cms,"New Delhi: In the sweltering heat of Delhi's streets, a young father's love and determination shines brighter than the scorching sun. Sonu , a 23-year-old food delivery rider , embarks on a daily odyssey spanning hundreds of kilometres with his two-year-old son, Sarthak, nestled by his side.The story of this father-son bond began in Bihar, where Sonu shouldered responsibilities at the tender age of six, juggling work and education to support his family.Love led him to Delhi in 2019 after he married Nancy against the wishes of both their parents. Equipped with nothing but hope, he started life toiling as a labourer for a meagre Rs 200 a day, then became a security guard, and finally has been a delivery rider for the past three years. Early this year, Nancy returned to her hometown, entrusting the child to Sonu's care.Since then, every day is a battle for the youth. Yet every kilometre of riding on his rented Yulu bike propels him closer to his dream of securing a brighter tomorrow for Sarthak. ""I just want my son to go to school soon, to study and pursue his dreams, to play with friends and be hopeful about a future where he gets a fair chance at life,"" the young father confided.After doing the rounds of the city the entire day, Sonu manages to earn Rs 500. But the smiles on Sarthak's face at the end of the day further ignite his determination to persevere in this work. Sonu works over 12 hours a day, finding fleeting solace in conversations with Sarthak while resting on footpaths or in parks. His deepest aspiration is for a day when he and his son can take time off together — to play, eat and simply cherish each other's company.The daily dilemma of bringing Sarthak to work or leaving him unattended weighs heavily on Sonu's heart. He dreads the perils of traffic, accidents, pollution and dust, hazards he wishes he could shield his son from. Opening up to TOI, he told of the difficulties of balancing his role as a food delivery rider with being his kid's carer: ""There have been times when stray dogs have chased my bike and I've had to protect my son while dealing with the threat. I've even been bitten by dogs, yet I continue to make deliveries, all the while trying to keep my son safe.""Sonu's earnings as a delivery rider are dependent solely on the number of orders he completes. He, therefore, cannot make compromises. He has to maximise his deliveries to ensure there's sufficient money to provide for his family. He said, ""There have been times when I struggled to afford food for myself, yet I always prioritised meals for my son. My wife, even during her pregnancy, worked tirelessly as a house help to contribute to our household expenses. Now that she has returned to our village, I am determined to step up and shoulder an equal share of the responsibility for raising our child.""Exhaustion and fear wrestle with love and responsibility, but Sonu soldiers on, his fuel being the prospect of a bright future for his two-year-old.","Sonu is a 23-year-old food delivery rider in New Delhi.

"Eye on China, India & Singapore talk SCS, Quad; chip deal to boost ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-singapore-talk-scs-quad-chip-deal-to-boost-ties/articleshow/113103820.cms,"India and Singapore upgraded bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held talks with his counterpart Lawrence Wong to boost cooperation in a range of areas from advanced manufacturing and digitalisation to skills and healthcare. Four MoUs were signed, including one for establishing a semiconductor ecosystem partnership that was hailed as a major takeaway from Modi’s first visit to the country in 6 years.Amid growing concerns over Chinese assertiveness, the leaders also reaffirmed in a joint statement the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea ( SCS ). Agreeing that regional security and stability is essential for the growth of both nations, they called for pursuing peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 UNCLOS, without resorting to the threat or use of force.Interestingly, and probably for the first time, an India-Singapore joint statement specifically mentioned not just SCS but also Quad as both nations welcomed Quad’s support for ASEAN centrality, including its agenda to support priorities and needs of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and explored synergies for mutually beneficial cooperation. This follows the recent threat of a military conflict between China and the Philippines in SCS. A non-claimant country in SCS disputes, Singapore has traditionally avoided taking sides in the US-China rivalry in Southeast Asia, balancing its ties with Beijing with robust military and security cooperation with the US. Singapore’s remarks with India on SCS and Quad also followed a joint naval exercise with China this week that underscored its “longstanding and friendly” defence ties with Beijing.India and Singapore are looking to enhance bilateral cooperation through advanced manufacturing, with focus on semiconductors. Modi and Wong also visited AEM, a leading Singapore company in semiconductor and electronics sector. Singapore is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, accounting for over 10 percent of international semiconductor market.“Both Prime Ministers agreed that advanced manufacturing, particularly in developing resilient semiconductor supply chains, can be a new pillar of bilateral cooperation,” said a joint statement. MoUs were signed for cooperation also in healthcare, skill development and digitisation, affirming common interests in AI and cyber security.“Singapore is an important pillar of our Acr East Policy. Our common trust in democratic values links us. We will continue to work with Singapore for regional peace, stability and prosperity,” said Modi in his remarks after the meeting with Wong.Both PMs, according to the joint statement, reaffirmed their commitment to work together to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region. “They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which promotes free trade and open markets and where differences are resolved peacefully in accordance with international law,” said the statement.Modi called for enhanced defence cooperation to address common maritime challenges and Wong thanked him for India’s “consistent” support for the Singapore Armed Forces' training in India which has elevated, he said, in both scope and scale in all domains, and welcomed India's active participation in the regional security architecture.The leaders also condemned terrorism, underlining their resolve to fight terrorist organisations. “Both Prime Ministers recognized that terrorism continues to remain the single most significant threat to peace and stability and reiterated their strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stressed that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever,” said the joint statement.","India and Singapore are looking to enhance bilateral cooperation through advanced manufacturing, with focus on semiconductors.
