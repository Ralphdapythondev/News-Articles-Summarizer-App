It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala.

Jharkhand moves contempt plea against Centre in SC for delay in appointing CJ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-moves-contempt-plea-against-centre-in-sc-for-delay-in-appointing-cj/articleshow/113506040.cms,"Centre's deliberate inaction violates

Article 216

: Jharkhand to SC

NEW DELHI: In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre for its ""deliberate and wilful"" delay in implementing the SC collegium 's July 11 resolution recommending appointment of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao as chief justice of the state, reported.In its petition, the Hemant Soren govt said the state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19.It said the SC's five-member collegium led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, anticipating the vacancy, had recommended to the Centre to transfer the Himachal Pradesh HC CJ to Jharkhand HC as its CJ.It said despite the passage of more than two months, the Union govt was deliberately sitting over the SC collegium's recommendation, a situation that displayed the Centre's complete disregard for the highest court's decisions.Jharkhand govt said Centre's deliberate inaction on the collegium resolution was also in violation of Article 216 of the Constitution, which says, ""Every high court shall consist of a chief justice and such other judges...""Constitutional courts are empowered to initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone who wilfully disobeys or ignoresjudicial orders of such courts. However, it is to be seen whether SC collegium resolutions can be put on the same pedestal as judicial orders to attract provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act if the Union govt disagrees or delays implementation.Seeking to push swift implementation of the collegium's recommendations, retired SC judge Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had warned Centre of contempt of court proceedings but refrained from acting on the caution.SC, through three judgments in the 1990s, made the collegium the sole arbiter in appointments of judges to the apex court and HCs but it has not spelt out the timeframe within which the recommendations are to be implemented. Moreover, while the Centre cannot refuse to comply with the collegium's decision, it can seek a review by flagging issues which it feels escaped the attention of the body or did not get adequate consideration.Information about Jharkhand moving a contempt petition against Centre was shared by CJI Chandrachud with attorney general R Venkataramani when the top law officer was requesting adjournment of Friday's hearing on a PIL by Harsh Vibhor Singh, who sought time-bound implementation of the collegium's recommendations for appointment & transfer of HC judges.The AG told the bench of CJI and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra he would provide details on appointment of CJs to HCs next week. SC asked the AG to renew the request for adjournment on Friday as the case was already listed.Apart from recommending transfer of Justice Rao from Himachal Pradesh high court to Jharkhand, the SC collegium on July 11 had passed a resolution for appointment of chief justices to seven HCs. However, the Centre cited certain ""sensitive material"" to request the collegium to reconsider certain recommendations.Based on the material, the collegium on Sept 17 had changed its proposals on appointment of CJs to three HCs - Himachal Pradesh (after the retirement of Justice Rajiv Shakdher), Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.","In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre.

The landmark mission, scheduled for launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, US, will be India's second govt-sponsored human spaceflight in over four decades - Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma had gone to space as part of a Soviet mission in 1984.The Axiom-4 mission is a result of a bilateral initiative between India and US. More than a year ago, PM Narendra Modi, during an official state visit to US, had announced that an Indian astronaut will travel to ISS. Subsequently, Isro signed a space flight agreement with Axiom Space, an American human spaceflight services provider and infrastructure developer.Shukla and his backup - fellow Indian astronaut, group captain Prashanth Nair - are both IAF test pilots and have joined an international crew for this mission. Its commander Peggy Whitson shared exclusive details about Shukla's role, the mission and more with TOI on email.""As the Ax-4 pilot, Shukla will assist me in conducting essential spacecraft operations, such as navigation and docking procedures,"" Whitson said. ""Training will prepare him to handle emergencies and perform critical system checks. Additionally, Shukla will support scientific research by setting up and managing microgravity experiments. This role involves extensive training in both the technical and operational aspects of spacecraft, ensuring he is well-prepared to contribute to the mission's goals and overall success.""In a recent Instagram live programme, Isro chairman S Somanath said that the Indian astronaut will conduct five experiments on ISS as part of the mission. The mission will also help India prepare for its Gaganyaan programme - Isro's first crewed mission - by providing valuable experience in spaceflight operations and international cooperation.Whitson added that Axiom Space has developed thorough training programmes for astronauts, emphasising both technical skills and emergency preparedness.""We work closely with Nasa and other international space agencies to ensure smooth integration with ISS. Additionally, Axiom invests in cutting-edge medical research and technology to monitor and maintain astronaut health during missions. By leveraging these strategies, Axiom Space aims to mitigate risks and ensure the success of our missions,"" she said.Elaborating on the preparations, she said Ax-4 astronauts will undergo rigorous training at Nasa, the Elon Musk-founded SpaceX , European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), and other partner facilities to prepare for the mission. The training covers safety protocols, health management, and ISS systems operations.""We practise in ISS mockups, reviewing procedures and enacting emergency scenarios to ensure we're ready for any situation. Additionally, we receive specialised training for the research and technology demonstration payloads for the mission,"" she said.The preparation also includes learning about launch site operations. The comprehensive training ensures that astronauts are well-equipped to conduct scientific research and technology demonstrations in the unique environment of ISS.The mission will utilise SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. The Dragon's automated docking capabilities and state-of-the-art life support systems ensure a secure journey for the crew. This technology, combined with the diverse expertise of the international crew, sets the Ax-4 mission apart from previous space endeavours.Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with an impressive history of 675 days in space. Her extensive experience, including her role as a two-time ISS commander and former chief of Nasa's Astronaut Office, brings invaluable expertise to the mission. Her current position as director of human spaceflight for Axiom Space further underscores the mission's significance in advancing commercial space ventures.Also part of the Ax-4 mission to ISS are specialists Slawosz Uznanski of Poland and Hungarian Tibor Kapu. Uznanski, a member of ESA's Astronaut Reserve Class of 2022, brings his expertise in radiation testing and electronics systems for space applications.Kapu, selected for the Hungarian to Orbit (Hunor) Astronaut Programme, specialises in space radiation protection and pharmaceutical research.""The Ax-4 crew will spend up to 14 days aboard ISS. This mission will realise the return to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary, marking each nation's first mission to the space station in history and second govt-sponsored human spaceflight mission in over 40 years. This mission emphasises how Axiom Space is redefining the pathway to low-Earth orbit and elevating national space programs globally,"" Whitson said.The Ax-4 mission aims to support policy frameworks and incentives that boost commercial activities in space.""The mission is normalising access, allowing countries and space agencies with varying capacities to contribute to and benefit from space exploration. Axiom Space missions play a pivotal role in advancing international cooperation in space exploration. By partnering with organisations like ESA, Isro, and Hunor, Axiom fosters collaboration in human spaceflight, research, and technology development. Through these efforts, Axiom is building a sustainable and innovative commercial space ecosystem,"" Whitson said.","Indian astronaut group captain Shubhanshu Shukla is set to make history as the pilot of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission that will mark India's first human presence on the International Space Station.

In any case, an inter-state committee monitors release of water from overflowing dams.""While Mamata said the border was being closed to pre-empt cars being swept away by surging floodwaters on this side of the border, Soren-led JMM threatened retaliation over Bengal Police barring trucks and other commercial vehicles from Jharkhand beyond Dhanbad-West Burdwan border in Kulti .""I called DVC chairperson (S Suresh Kumar) and spoke to Jharkhand CM Soren, urging them not to release water... This cannot be allowed,"" the CM said, pointing out that 26 people had died in the floods and 2.5 lakh people displaced.Mamata alleged that DVC hadn't been providing details of how much water was being released from dams in the neighbouring state. Senior officials in several of Bengal's westernmost districts said police checkpoints had been set up along the border with Jharkhand and all inbound vehicles were being stopped, barring any emergency.Mamata, who visited East Midnapore 's Panskura and Howrah's Udaynarayanpur Thursday to survey the flood damage, later held an emergency meeting at the state secretariat with chief secretary Manoj Pant, DGP Rajeev Kumar and other senior officers. ""Even Durga Puja pandals are under water,"" the CM said.""Why should Bengal always suffer? Why will DVC always try to keep Jharkhand safe? I need to protect Bengal,"" she said. ""This flooding is not because of rain. It is because of the absence of any desilting or dredging despite my appeals to PM Narendra Modi.""DVC executive director Anjani Dubey said the PSU had ""reduced the release of water, corresponding to reduction in rainfall"". Denying Banerjee's accusations, the Centre said all norms were followed while releasing water from DVC. The Jal Shakti ministry and power ministry said all parties concerned were kept informed about the weather conditions likely to prevail from Sept 14-16 and the release of water.","Bengal's battle with floods triggered a face-off with Jharkhand Thursday.

These can be summarised as theatres associated with ISIL or AQ-linked extremist groups active in and around Jammu and Kashmir, whether directly or via proxies or affiliates, as well as other separatist movements in the region; other ISIL and AQ cells, their affiliates, or radicalised individuals in India; regional insurgencies in the Northeast and North of India; and left-wing extremist groups seeking to overthrow the government.

In January 2023, New Delhi issued a similar notice, citing Pakistan's failure to cooperate in its implementation.According to PTI sources, the recent notice builds on this earlier one and reflects India’s concerns over various issues, including demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development to meet its emission targets.India has also raised concerns about the implications of cross-border terrorism, with officials suggesting that the treaty's provisions require updating to reflect new security realities. The review request is in view of India’s dissatisfaction with Pakistan’s handling of disputes related to the treaty, particularly over the Kishenganga and Ratle Hydro Electric Projects in Jammu and Kashmir.The World Bank , which is a signatory to the treaty, appointed a neutral expert and established a Court of Arbitration to resolve differences over the projects. New Delhi has since expressed frustration over the World Bank’s decision, arguing that the initiation of two concurrent processes violates the treaty's prescribed dispute resolution mechanism.","India formally sought a review of the 64-year-old Indus Water Treaty (IWT) Pakistan reaffirmed the agreement's importance, expressing hope that New Delhi would continue to adhere to its provisions.

Bittu’s remarks followed Gandhi’s statements about Sikhs being limited in their ability to wear traditional symbols such as turbans and kadas or to visit Gurudwaras.In a video message, Bittu said, ""I want to tell Mallikarjun Kharge and every Congress worker that you can happily protest against me if this makes the Gandhi family happy.

Whatever Rahul Gandhi said about Sikhs, it was endorsed by the most dangerous terrorist. When you did not say this, then I said that it is clear that Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress leaders are standing with Pannun.”Meanwhile, regarding the FIR Bittu said that, he stands by his comments and is not afraid of police complaints.In response, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu criticised Bittu’s remarks, suggesting they were a ploy to attract attention and criticising BJP leadership for allowing such statements. Sukhu remarked, “The BJP is making their junior leaders make remarks against him (Rahul Gandhi)... National President JP Nadda should control such leaders.”Rahul Gandhi’s comments about the Sikh community, which he made during his US visit, sparked a political uproar.

""Though numbers of prosecutions and convictions have started to increase, the backlog of pending cases remains considerable, with a large number of accused persons awaiting conclusion of their trials.

Their case is that since the NPO sector is very big, we should have good risk-based metrics. For India, it should be a risk-based regulation and not stifling regulation.

Also, three of the four Valley districts covered in Phase I — Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam — saw a jump of around 2 to 12 percentage points in turnouts as compared to 2014 assembly poll.Overall, the people’s participation in J&K Phase I poll, at slightly over 61.1%, was better than the 60% polling witnessed in 2014 assembly poll and way higher than the corresponding 50.3% turnout in the same districts in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls .The polling was higher in all four Valley’s districts as compared to 2024 LS but slightly lower only in Anantnag when compared to 2014 assembly polls.

Also, an assembly constituency (AC) wise comparison between 2014 and current assembly elections would not be accurate as the constituencies were redrawn in 2022 as part of the delimitation exercise.Commenting on the improved turnout, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar told TOI that the people of Jammy & Kashmir have proven right the Urdu couplet recited by him while announcing J&K polls on August 16, which, translated into English, means that “in the celebration of democracy, your (J&K people’s) participation will show the world the story of defeat of mala fide intentions (napaak iraadon ki shikast)”.A comparison of AC-wise turnouts between 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the current election shows thatKulgam AC , where six terrorists were killed in two separate encounters in July, recorded the highest surge of 28.5 percent age points (34.2% to 62.7%). In once terrorist-infested Anantnag, there was a jump of over 14 percentage points in turnout across both Dooru AC and Srigufwara-Bijbehara AC, 12.1 percentage points in Anantnag AC and 11.8 percentage points each in Anantnag West AC and Shangus-Anantnag East AC.Pulwama AC and Pampore AC in Pulwama district, where a terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Feb 2019 had killed 40 personnel, witnessed an improvement of 6-7 percentage points in turnout as compared to 2024 Lok Sabha polls, even as Tral AC saw a rise of 3 percentage points. Pahalgam AC showed the district’s highest jump at 13.6 percentage points.In terror-hit Shopian, Shopian AC and Zainapora AC saw a turnout increase of 14.4 and 13.2 percentage points respectively over the LS polls.In the Jammu region, Doda AC, Doda West AC and Bhadarwah AC in Doda district, where five soldiers were killed by terrorists in two separate incidents in July, respectively witnessed a 4.3, 6.6 and 4.2 percentage points increase in polling over LS elections. Banihal AC and Ramban AC in Ramban district recorded a surge of 12.3 and 2.9 percentage points respectively.

Despite his financial hardships, he always wanted to give something special to the PM.In a video message, he said: ""I admired Narendra Modi for a long time and wanted to meet him. In 2013, I started saving money to buy him a gift. After a few years, I decided to make a pheran, the traditional Kashmiri dress , for the PM."" ""I bought a good fabric with the money I had saved.

CHANDIGARH: Jawan and kisan headlined BJP's manifesto for the Oct 5 Haryana polls that party president J P Nadda unveiled in Rohtak Thursday, containing a job guarantee to Agniveers at the end of their contracted four-year military service and MSP for 24 crops, reported.The manifesto also promises a more-than-double hike in compensation for crop failure from Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000 an acre.Nadda contrasted it with Congress's alleged negligence of farmers and failure to ensure MSP for more than eight crops. Cong's guarantees include a legal guarantee for MSP. Lado Luxmi Yojana , under which every woman can claim a monthly stipend of Rs 2,100, aims to go one-up on a similar commitment in Cong manifesto with an extra Rs 100.Another similarity with Congress's guarantees is subsidised cooking gas at Rs 500 a cylinder. BJP has also promised a scooty each to rural girls going to college under its Avval Balika Yojna (scheme for meritorious girls). For the backward classes, the saffron party has lined up guaranteed entrepreneurship loans of Rs 25 lakh each and welfare boards for different categories. Full scholarships will be offered to OBC and SC students on admission to engineering or medical colleges.While Congress's manifesto assures citizens of free medical treatment worth up to Rs 25 lakh, BJP's commitment is limited to Rs 10 lakh, with a provision for an additional Rs 5 lakh for those above 70 years.BJP's manifesto countered Congress's social-security pension of Rs 6,000 a month under different categories with a commitment to pay pension proportionate to the increase in dearness allowance for govt employees and pensioners. Like Congress, the saffron party promises two lakh govt jobs without any ""parchi-kharchi"" (favouritism or bribe). The manifesto doesn't mention the old pension scheme, which Congress wants to revive. Nadda pointed out that Haryana's per capita income had more than doubled since 2014, from Rs 1.37 lakh to Rs 3 lakh in 2023. The state's exports, too, soared from Rs 68,000 crore to Rs 2.5 lakh crore during the same period, he said.The BJP chief highlighted electrification of 5,800-odd villages as another achievement, pointing out that the list comprised 538 villages a decade ago.

All these unfortunate and shameful statements are the responsibility of you and your party.Listing over a series of abuses, Nadda alleged, ""In the last 10 years, the leaders of Congress and Company have abused the country's illustrious Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji more than 110 times and the unfortunate thing is that the top leadership of Congress is also involved in this.""""Sometimes it was said 'Modi will dig your grave', sometimes it was said 'neech', sometimes 'bastard', sometimes 'merchant of death', sometimes 'poisonous snake', sometimes 'scorpion', sometimes 'rat', sometimes 'Ravan', Sometimes 'Bhasmasur,"" he said as he went on to mention a series of inappropriate words.He said that the Congress' letter exposed the ""double standards"" of the party adding that ""On one hand you are calling for political correctness but on the other hand your party and your leaders have a history of flouting political correctness. Why such a double attitude?""Congress retorted to the ""meaningless"" response, recalling the time when former PM Manmohan Singh used to reply to ""all official and personal letters sent to him for seventeen years - as over 100 volumes of his selected works attest.""Taking to X, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, ""When former PM Dr Manmohan Singh writes to the non-biological PM on Covid-19, the health minister is handed a humiliating reply to send in his name.""""Now when the president of Congress and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge ji wrote a letter to the non-biological Prime Minister regarding the serious threats being given to the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi by Modi ji's associates, the BJP President was given the task of sending a meaningless reply,"" he added.Nadda further levelled serious allegations against the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi saying that attends programs supporting terrorists. The BJP president, however, provided no proof of these allegations.""Kharge ji, why is the Congress party proud of Rahul Gandhi? Because he makes mistakes with pro-Pakistan and anti-India people or because they go and stand in programs supporting terrorists? Because they seek support from the forces trying to break the country or because they seek interference from foreign powers in the country's democracy?"" Nadda said in the letter.""Because they rail against peace in Jammu and Kashmir or because they support the release of terrorists, talks with Pakistan, trade with Pakistan and reintroduction of Article 370? Because they call Hindus a bigger threat than Pakistani terrorist organizations or because they repeatedly insult Hindu Sanatan culture? Because they demand proof of the bravery of the army personnel or because they term the bravery of the soldiers as 'blood brokering'? That's why they give controversial statements on the turban and bracelets of Sikh brothers?"" he addedKharge, in his letter to PM Modi, had expressed concern over Rahul Gandhi being called ""number one terrorist"" by the BJP leader and Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu.","BJP chief JP Nadda hit back at Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He accused the grand old party of hurling abuses at PM Modi over 110 times in the past decade. Kharge asked the PM to school his party leaders regarding the use of ""violent languages"" against Rahul Gandhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113478530,imgsize-765320,width-400,resizemode-4/113478530.jpg"
