Indian-origin bar owner sentenced in Singapore for raping runaway 17-year-old girl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-origin-bar-owner-sentenced-in-singapore-for-raping-runaway-17-year-old-girl/articleshow/111592765.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin bar owner was sentenced to jail on Monday for raping a runaway 17-year-old girl after allowing her to work for him. Raj Kumar Bala, 42, was sentenced to jail for 13 years and four weeks. According to Channel News Asia, Bala, 42, was convicted of a charge each of raping and molesting the victim and pleaded guilty to a third charge of harbouring a runaway under the Children and Young Persons Act.In February 2020, the victim, then 17, ran away from the Singapore Girls' Home and learned about a job opening at Bala's Don Bar and Bistro in Dunlop Street, Little India. She was informed about the position by another runaway already employed there, who had also been sexually assaulted by Bala, a charge currently on hold.The victim visited the bar for a job interview with Bala, who outlined her responsibilities, including serving customers and making drinks. Bala offered her the job and mentioned she could stay at the bar with other runaways. After working for a few days, the police received a tip-off about absconders employed there and raided the bar in the early hours of February 22, 2020. The victim fled with another girl to evade the raid but was later picked up by Bala.He drove them to his condominium, telling them they could stay there, before drinking alcohol with the girls. He raped the victim while she was heavily intoxicated and also engaged in sexual acts with the other girl.The victim left the condominium and turned herself in to the Singapore Girls' Home in July 2020, only revealing to her case worker in August 2020 that she had been raped.Justice Mavis Chionh acknowledged the ""considerable personal harm"" the victim endured, noting that the victim blamed herself for being intoxicated, which she believes led to the incident.Her court testimony, supported by her former boyfriend, highlighted how her past trauma continues to affect her well-being, the judge observed. Justice Chionh also noted that Bala was aware of the victim's young age, her fugitive status, and her dependency on him for income and shelter.Bala faces additional charges and has yet to decide how he will address them. According to ""The Straits Times,"" the bar owner has 22 more charges pending in court related to sex offences involving five other victims.He is accused of raping and molesting a victim identified in court documents as B1, raping and sexually assaulting a victim identified as B5 and raping, molesting and threatening another victim identified as B6.He is also accused of sexually penetrating a minor under the age of 16, identified as B7, and molesting and causing alarm to another victim, identified as B8.","Raj Kumar Bala, 42, was sentenced to jail for 13 years and four weeks.

Acreage of water-guzzling paddy, on the other hand, has so far increased by merely 19%.The country had even reported higher acreage of Kharif crops in June compared to the corresponding period in 2023, despite a bigger deficit in monsoon rainfall for the month. Though both the years — 2023 and 2024 — reported deficit rainfall in June, the deficit this year (11%) was bigger than the deficit (9%) last year. Nevertheless, acreage of Kharif crops as on June 28 this year was 59 lakh hectares (over 32%) more than the corresponding period of last year.Agriculture ministry’s acreage data shows that the total sown area in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares compared to 181 lakh hectares during the same period last year.“Since many areas did not receive rainfall in June, farmers preferred to opt for less water-consuming pulses (arhar) and oilseeds (soybean) over water-guzzling paddy. Such smart choices could see higher acreage this June compared to the same month last year,” said an official.The sown area is expected to increase further in July as there is a forecast of ‘above normal’ rainfall for the month. “Fairly good distributed rainfall during July-September will, hopefully, increase the Kharif acreage this year over the normal (average of last five years) acreage of the season,” said the official.",The monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole turned from 11% deficit on June 30 to 2% surplus on July 8.

He was received at the airport by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov , who is senior to the Deputy Prime Minister that received Chinese President Xi Jinping during his recent visit to Russia.The protocol of having Manturov personally welcome PM Modi and accompany him to the hotel in the same car sends a strong signal about the importance Russia places on its relationship with India.This reception, with the highest-ranking Russian official below President Putin himself, contrasts with China's welcome, where the lower-ranking Deputy Prime Minister received President Xi.India has maintained a close relationship with Russia since the Cold War, and Russia was once India's largest arms supplier. However, the Ukraine conflict has strained Russia's military resources, leading to a decline in Russian arms exports to India in recent years.At the same time, India has emerged as a major buyer of discounted Russian oil, providing much-needed revenue for Moscow. This has reshaped the energy partnership, with India saving billions while bolstering Russia's war coffers.PM Modi's visit, his first to Russia since 2019, comes as India seeks to balance its longstanding ties with Moscow with growing security cooperation with Western powers.The high-level reception by Russia underscores India's continued significance as a partner, even as the global landscape shifts.","India has maintained a close relationship with Russia since the Cold War.

Russia laid out the red carpet for PM Narendra Modi as he landed in Moscow on Monday to attend the 22nd India-Russia annual summit , the first since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Before the talks on Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin held a private dinner for Modi during which the two discussed bilateral cooperation that has deepened in the recent past on the back of India's increased oil imports from Russia.According to govt sources, the visit will focus on economic issues, including energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilisers. The visit will also be used by the PM to convey to Putin, as an official source put it, that ""no solution can be found on the battlefield"" to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Ahead of leaving for Moscow for his first bilateral visit in his third term, Modi said he's looking forward to sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues.Ahead of leaving for Moscow, PM Modi said he's looking forward to sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues; and that India seeks to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region. Like China, India never explicitly condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine.While backing dialogue and diplomacy for enduring peace, India has also maintained that any such process must involve both the parties. The last annual summit took place in 2021 when Putin visited India. The two did meet though on the margins of the SCO summit in Samarkand in 2022, where Modi famously told Putin this isn't the era of war. He's expected to convey a similar message on this occasion too, in line with India's emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy as the only realistic way of resolving the conflict.Modi will co-chair the summit on Tuesday with Putin and also interact with the members of Indian community in Moscow. In his meeting with Putin, Modi is expected to also seek the release of Indian men fighting for the Russian army in the Ukraine war. Putin hosted Modi at his private residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, a Moscow suburb.""The Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in the areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges,"" said Modi, adding he's looking forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with his ""friend"" Putin.In a post on X, Modi also said stronger ties between our nations will greatly benefit people of both countries. The PM, who is visiting Russia for the first time in five years, was received by first deputy PM of Russia, Denis Manturov. Indian officials said Manturov is senior to the deputy PM who received Chinese President during his visit to Russia. Manturov also accompanied Modi to the hotel from the airport in the same car.About his visit to Austria starting late on Tuesday, the first by an Indian PM in 41 years, Modi said he's looking forward to discussions to take the partnership to even greater heights in new and emerging areas of innovation, technology and sustainable development among others.","PM Narendra Modi is in Moscow for the 22nd India-Russia annual summit.

Top 11k ranks spread evenly across 800 NEET centres: NTA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-11k-ranks-spread-evenly-across-800-neet-centres-nta/articleshow/111588080.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) has said that only 175 candidates from 12 centres in Patna and eight from two Godhra centres managed to score 640 or above in the NEET-UG exam. None of the candidates from the Godhra centres under scrutiny scored 680 or above, and only 35 candidates from the Patna centres achieved this score, it said.Claiming there was no "" systemic leak "", agency officials told TOI that the top 1000, 5000 and 10,000 students were distributed across the 800-plus centres and were not necessarily from the cohort of centres under scrutiny.NTA said its data analysis did not indicate a ""larger leak"" beyond Patna. It also said the candidate whose test booklet was investigated scored just 103 marks. ""Roshni, whose booklet was confiscated by Bihar Police, scored 103 marks out of 720,"" an NTA official said.Agency officials claimed that data analysis of the top 11,000 ranks showed an even distribution across 800-plus centres. Explaining the analysis, an official said following the alleged leak, NTA examined not just the top scorers but also those beyond the top 100.""We looked into the scoring patterns for each group of thousand candidates and their distribution. For example, the top 1,000 candidates are spread across 800 centres,"" the official said. He added that the top 1 lakh candidates, who are most likely to secure MBBS or dental seats, are distributed across 4,500 of the 4,750 centres, debunking allegations that toppers were concentrated in specific centres. ""If we examine even smaller groups, such as the top 5,000 candidates, they too are distributed across 780 centres,"" he said.Over 13 lakh of the 23 lakh candidates who took the medical entrance test on May 5 qualified. The official argued that if there was widespread irregularities and access to question papers as alleged, the qualification average for Patna and Godhra would have been much higher. ""The qualifying average for Patna and Godhra are not only lower than the national average but also lower than their neighbouring cities and centres,"" the official said.Another concern raised by the petitioners and the SC was the significant increase in the number of perfect scorers. This year, 67 candidates scored 720, compared to just seven in the last four years. Later, six candidates were stripped of the grace marks due to time loss, which had given them perfect scores, and were offered a retest. Five who took the retest on June 23 scored less than 720.","Only 175 candidates from 12 centres in Patna and eight from two Godhra centres managed to score 640 or above in the NEET-UG exam.

"Courts can't ask accused to share live location as bail condition, says Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-cant-ask-accused-to-share-live-location-as-bail-condition-says-supreme-court/articleshow/111589569.cms,"SC: Riders can't be so severe as to frustrate bail order itself

NEW DELHI: Frowning upon courts, including itself, for directing accused to share their 'live location' with investigating agencies as a condition for being released on bail, Supreme Court Monday said that allowing a probe agency to continuously peep into the life of a person would constitute violation of the right to privacy.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan reminded all courts to ensure that bail conditions should be such that constitutional rights of an accused were curtailed only to the ""minimum extent required"" and to maintain restraint and refrain from imposing ""fanciful, arbitrary or freakish"" conditions.Courts must show restraint while imposing bail conditions. Therefore, while granting bail, courts can curtail the freedom of the accused only to the extent required for imposing the bail conditions warranted by law. Bail conditions cannot be so onerous as to frustrate the order of bail itself. For example, the court may impose a condition of periodically reporting to the police station/court or not travelling abroad without prior permission, the SC bench said.Where circumstances require, the court may impose a condition restraining an accused from entering a particular area to protect the prosecution witnesses or the victims, the Supreme Court bench added.""But the court cannot impose a condition on the accused to keep the police constantly informed about his movement from one place to another. The object of the bail condition cannot be to keep a constant vigil on the movements of the accused enlarged on bail,"" it said.""The investigating agency cannot be permitted to continuously peep into the private life of the accused enlarged on bail, by imposing arbitrary conditions since that will violate the right of privacy of the accused, as guaranteed by Article 21,"" it added.The bench also held that a bail condition could not be imposed on a foreign national to get a certificate from the embassy that he shall not leave the country and shall appear before the special court as and when required.The bench noted that the object of imposing conditions of bail was to ensure that the accused did not interfere with or obstruct the investigation, remained available for the probe, did not tamper with or destroy evidence, remained regularly present for the trial and did not create obstacles in trial proceedings.""While imposing bail conditions, constitutional rights of an accused, who is ordered to be released on bail, can be curtailed only to the minimum extent required. Even an accused convicted by a competent court and undergoing a sentence in prison is not deprived of rights to life and privacy guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution,"" the bench said.It said presumption of innocence was applicable with the accused and he could not be deprived of all his rights guaranteed under the Constitution.Taking note of Google's reply in this case, the court said the PIN location did not enable real-time tracking of the user or the user's device. ""Therefore, the condition of the accused dropping a pin on Google Maps, as it stands, is completely redundant as the same does not help,"" it said.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan reminded all courts to ensure that bail conditions should be such that constitutional rights of an accused were curtailed only to the ""minimum extent required"" They said courts must show restraint and refrain from imposing ""fanciful, arbitrary or freakish"" conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111589694,imgsize-422344,width-400,resizemode-4/111589694.jpg"

He gave up his life to save others,” said an inconsolable Smriti Singh, the widow of Captain Anshuman Singh, while she stood before President Droupadi Murmu with folded hands to accept the Kirti Chakra , India’s second-highest gallantry honour, awarded posthumously to her husband on Friday for saving his fellow men's lives and trying to protect critical medical equipment during a fire incident at an Army dump on the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen Glacier.Captain Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen. On July 19, 2023, an ammunition dump caught fire in the dead of night. The Captain saw a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames and quickly acted to save those trapped inside. He successfully rescued several individuals, but while trying to save critical medical equipment from a medical investigation centre that also caught fire, he laid down his life.The Rashtrapati Bhavan statement said: “Disregarding his own safety, Captain Anshuman Singh exhibited exceptional bravery and resolve to rescue many people during a major fire incident in Siachen. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra (posthumously) for his act of conspicuous gallantry and sacrifice.” Smriti Singh, along with the Captain’s mother Manju Singh, received the award from the President.After receiving the Kirti Chakra, Smriti Singh, in a video posted by a defense ministry spokesperson, recalled, “He once told me, ‘I would die with the brass on my chest. I would not die an ordinary death’.”Recalling her first meeting with Captain Singh, Smriti said, “We met on the first day of college. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it was love at first sight. After a month, he got selected into the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). We met at an engineering college, but then he got selected for medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long years.”“Then we decided to get married. Unfortunately, within two months of our marriage, he got posted to Siachen,” she said.“On July 18, we had a long conversation about how our life was going to be in the next 50 years. We would build a house, have kids... On the morning of July 19, I got a call that he was no more. For the next 7-8 hours, we were not ready to accept that anything of this sort had happened. Now that I have the Kirti Chakra in my hand, maybe it is true. It’s okay; he’s a hero. We can manage our lives. But he gave his life to save the other three families, his army family,” Smriti said, trying to hold back her tears.After the incident last year, Captain Singh was cremated with full state honours in Bhagalpur in UP’s Deoria district, on July 22, 2023.President Murmu also presented 26 Shaurya Chakras, including seven posthumously, to personnel of the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, and state/UT police during a defence investiture ceremony.","Captain Anshuman Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought a report from CBI on its investigation into the NEET-UG question paper leak by Wednesday and assured over 23 lakh students who took the exam on May 5 that it may order a retest only if the beneficiaries of the leak could not be identified and the integrity of the entrance exam for MBBS courses was found to have been completely vitiated.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra heard a batch of over 50 petitions by candidates, who through lead counsel Narender Hooda have sought cancellation of NEET-UG by citing the paper leak, first detected in Patna, and other irregularities reported from different states, by arguing that the entire examination was vitiated as the questions and answers were available on social media.The bench said a retest could be ordered only if three conditions were met - one, the alleged paper leak was systemic; two, if the leak compromised the sanctity and integrity of the entire test; and, three, if it was not possible to identify and segregate the beneficiaries of the fraud from the untainted candidates.The bench, however, emphasised that it would not order a retest ""if the breach is confined to specific centres and it is possible to identify and segregate beneficiaries"".It should not lead to cancellation of NEET-UG given the massive scale on which it is conducted at 4,750 centres in 571 cities across India and 14 cities abroad involving more than 23 lakh students who had studied hard and undertaken cost and efforts and would have to go through a fresh test, the bench said.Every year, about 23-24 lakh students compete for 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in various medical colleges, including 56,000 govt-run ones.Posting the matters for further hearing on Thursday, the CJI-led bench said it may order a fresh test if CBI status report fulfils the three parameters and after they have gone through the responses of the National Testing Agency and the Centre on the entire gamut of questions relating to the manner and mechanism of conducting the exam - right from framing of question papers by a group of experts selected by NTA to their safe custody till distribution at the test centres. NTA and the Centre have to submit their responses by 5pm Wednesday.SC noted with surprise that compared to just seven candidates who secured full 720 marks in the previous four NEET-UG exams, the number soared to 67 this year, and asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether it was possible for the cyber forensic unit of the home ministry to use data analytics to scrutinise answer sheets of suspiciously high scoring candidates in order to ascertain the spread of irregularities.Mehta said govt was ready to disclose all material but insisted that the irregularities and paper leak were localised incidents which did not vitiate the sanctity or integrity of the exam across the country.The bench said, ""We have to be ruthless with those who indulged in paper leak and those who benefited from it."" It asked NTA's counsel Naresh Kaushik to inform the court of action taken against those identified as beneficiaries of irregularities.It asked NTA to inform also about the nature of the paper leak, the places where leak took place, the time gap between the leak and the actual conduct of examination on May 5, the manner and spread of leak and dissemination of the question paper through social media. CBI has to place the findings of its investigation into all these aspects, the SC said while asking NTA to detail the steps taken to identify the beneficiaries of the fraud and the modalities followed to order retest for 1,563 candidates.Pushing for a glitch-free NEET-UG and similar competitive examinations in future, the bench said to prevent such incidents, it would be necessary to set up a multi-disciplinary committee whose members command public confidence to lay down modalities and processes for conducting such exams on which the future of lakhs of students hinge.""If such a committee is already set up by the govt, full details of their credentials would be made available so that the court can modify the composition to bring together talents in the field of administration, experts in the domain and data analytics to ensure integrity of examinations,"" the bench said.",Supreme Court seeks a report from CBI on its investigation into the NEET-UG question paper leak by Wednesday.

He had argued that land grab was not a predicate office under Prevention of Money Laundering Act and that the land alleged to have been forcibly taken by him was never in his name.The refusal to admit Soren's appeal was also for the fact that a trial court had already taken cognisance of a chargesheet filed against him in the land grab case.

Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom gear termed ' Ultra Set ', an equipment reportedly used by the Pakistani army that has ended up in the hands of terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir. Officials told news agency PTI that these specialised handsets , exclusively customised by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army , were seized after a gunfight in the intervening night of July 17-18 last year in the Sindarah in Jammu region's Poonch district and in April 26 this year after an encounter in north Kashmir's Baramulla district.“Ultra-Set” refers to highly encrypted Chinese telecom gear that has come into focus due to its use by terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir. These specialised handsets are said to be exclusively customised by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army.The 'Ultra-Set' handsets combine cell-phone capabilities with specialised radio equipment, operating on radio waves for message transmission and reception. Unlike traditional mobile technologies (GSM or CDMA), they rely on a unique communication mechanism.Each 'Ultra Set' is said to be linked to a control station located across the border, the officials said and added that the two 'Ultra Sets' cannot reach out to each other. They said Chinese satellites are used to carry these messages that are compressed to bytes from the handset to the master server in Pakistan for its onward transmission.China reportedly has been actively enhancing the defence capabilities of the Pakistani army along the LoC for quite some time now. This support includes the construction of steelhead bunkers, provisioning of unmanned aerial and combat aerial vehicles, installation of encrypted communication towers and laying of underground fibre cables.In addition, Chinese radar systems such as those of the ""JY"" and ""HGR"" series have been deployed to improve target detection capabilities, while advanced weaponry like the SH-15 truck-mounted howitzer has also been observed at various locations along the LoC.",“Ultra-Set” refers to highly encrypted Chinese telecom gear that has come into focus due to its use by terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.
