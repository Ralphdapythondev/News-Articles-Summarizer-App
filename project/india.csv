Madan Mohan

During His Lifetime, But The Decades Have Burnished The Legacy Of The

Composer

Whose Birth Centenary Is On June 25

Unsung star

Ghazal maestro

Man of principles

Some songs have afterlives. They are reborn in other languages, repurposed as jingles and cover versions, discovered and nurtured by new generations and geographies. Madan Mohan’s haunting composition, ‘ Lag Jaa Gale ’, a brew of melody and melancholy, belongs to that elite club of single malt songs.Here are the facts: the classic from ‘Woh Kaun Thi?’ (1964) was reused in a bunch of films, notably as ‘Ponmeni Thazhuvaamal’ — lensed on a teenage Jayalalitha in the 1966 Tamil film, ‘Yaar Nee?’ — and, more recently, in ‘Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3’ (2018). Several Pakistani singers have crooned it; there’s a qawwali version, too. The track was used to promote digital audio player, Saregama Carvaan. No wonder, the song, written by Raja Mehdi Ali Khan and voiced by Lata Mangeshkar, has over 300 million YouTube hits.And here’s the irony: ‘Lag Jaa Gale’ didn’t figure among the top 32 songs of 1964 in Binaca Geetmala’s annual hit parade even though two other numbers from the same film — ‘Jo humne dastan apni sunayee’ and ‘Naina barse rimjhim rimjhim’ — made it to the coveted chart.Lag Jaa Gale’s fate is emblematic of Baghdad-born music director Madan Mohan’s chequered career, which brims with moody melodies that have stood the test of time and changing taste but that seldom became chartbusters or won awards. In a career spanning 25 years, the composer didn’t take home a single Filmfare statuette.Only three of his songs figured in Geetmala’s Top 5 hits of the year. The frisky ‘Ae dil mujhe bata de’ (No.5 spot, film: ‘Bhai Bhai,’ 1956), the folksy and dancey, ‘Jhumka gira re’ (No.4, ‘Mera Saaya’, 1966), which was recast in Karan Johar’s ‘Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani’ (2023), and 1977’s ‘Koi pathar se na maare mere deewane ko’ (No.1, ‘Laila Majnu’). Tragically, the music director had breathed his last a couple of years before that. He was only 51.His eldest son Sanjeev Kohli writes that the lack of mass adulation always caused him anguish and, over the years, embittered him. “The man who was acknowledged as a genius by people who understood and appreciated music was never at the top rung in the hit parades or with the big banners or the big stars,” he says in the website, madanmohan.in.With exceptions like Madras-based production house AVM and filmmakers like Chetan Anand and Raj Khosla, Madan Mohan mostly scored music for smaller producers and directors. He worked for Devendra Goel (who gave him his break with ‘Ankhen’ in 1950), Shakti Samanta and Pramod Chakravarty, too, but that was much before they became industry biggies.The songs he composed were invariably better than the movies they were located in. Often, they are the only notable element of a film. Some of his finest work, ‘Dekh Kabira Roya’ (1958), ‘Jahan Ara’ (1964), ‘Dulhan Ek Raat Ki’ (inspired by Thomas Hardy’s ‘Tess of the d’Urbervilles’ (1967), was for movies that were mega flops. The songs are remembered, not because of the movie, but despite its failure.There is a timelessness and universality to his compositions, says film music historian Pavan Jha. Veer Zaara’s tunes were used about 30 years after his death, but they don’t sound outdated at all, he says.Nobody composed ghazals better in Hindi films. The music director with leading man looks had the gift to imbue songs with subterranean sadness even when the words were not overtly so, notably in ‘Aapki nazron ne samjha’ (‘Anpadh’, 1962), ‘Teri aankon ke siva duniya mein’ (‘Chirag’, 1969) and Dil dhoondta hai (‘Mausam’, 1975).Jha reasons that unlike some of the more popular music directors, Madan Mohan understood and appreciated Urdu poetry. He sang as well. “Which is why there’s a special symmetry of words and melody in his compositions,” he says. His niece, actor Anju Mahendroo, reinforces the point. “He wasn’t formally trained in music. But he was blessed with inborn talent. His music came from his heart,” she says.He was also a master of the mega song, best illustrat ed in ‘Tum jo mil gaye ho’ (‘Hanste Zakhm’, 1973) and ‘Har koi chahta hai’ (‘Ek Mutthi Aasman’, 1973). Like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, these ambitious tracks change tempo, evoking a multitude of yearnings. He was versatile, too. Few patriotic pieces are as moving as ‘Kar chale hum fida jaan-o-tan saathiyon’ (‘Haqeeqat’, 1964). And, you’d seldom have heard a more joyful track than ‘Zaroorat hai zaroorat hai’ (‘Man-Mauji’, 1962).Songwriter-singer Amitabh Bhattacharya stumbled upon a Madan Mohan track from the unreleased film, ‘Jahan Tum Wahan Hum’. “Over the days, I kept returning to it and I think it underlines the strength and class of the composer who is making us listen to his song in an era where everything is fleeting and clutter rules our audio universe,” he says. The song goes, ‘Kaise kategi zindagi tere bagair’.In 1970, Madan Mohan won the national award for best music director for ‘Dastak’. Writer-director Rajinder Singh Bedi’s movie had some of the composer’s most poignant and sensitive melodies like ‘Baiyan na dharo’ to ‘Hum-hain-mataae-koocha’ and ‘Mayee ree’. “He was extremely sensitive. During a song recording of ‘Hanste Zakhm’, he was so moved by a note of a sitar that he started weeping profusely,” recalls Mahendroo.He was also a man of conviction and principles, a trait he shared with fellow composers such as Jaidev and Khayyam. “While he was convinced that Talat Mahmood was the right singer for some of ‘Jahan Ara’s’ songs, the director was insistent that Rafi saab be given all the songs. My father did not budge and was willing to give up the film. The same thing happened when he chose Rafi saab over Kishore Kumar for the songs of ‘Laila Majnu’. The directors finally gave in and these films became musical landmarks,” Kohli writes. Overshadowed by Kishore Kumar in the post-‘Aradhana’ era, the superhit songs of ‘Laila Majnu’ helped Rafi stage a strong comeback.Like the finest of whiskeys, many of Madan Mohan’s compositions have aged remarkably well and his reputation vaulted. In the run-up to his 100th birth centenary, celebrations of his life and songs are planned in places such as Mumbai, Surat, Pune and others. The master music maker would have loved that.",Madan Mohan's birth centenary is on June 25. The composer didn't take home a single Filmfare statuette in a career spanning 25 years. The songs he composed were invariably better than the movies they were located in. His son Sanjeev Kohli writes that the lack of mass adulation always caused him anguish.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111200294,imgsize-31114,width-400,resizemode-4/111200294.jpg"
"Isro's reusable launch vehicle completes 3rd landing test, paving way for orbital re-entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isros-reusable-launch-vehicle-completes-3rd-landing-test-paving-way-for-orbital-re-entry/articleshow/111200124.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro, which had, on March 22 completed the second landing experiment of its reusable launch vehicle (RLV) — “RLV-LEX-02” — Sunday conducted the third landing experiment ( RLV-LEX-03 ), paving the way for an orbital re-entry test.The test was conducted at 7.10am at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) at Challakere in Chitradurga district, some 220km from Bengaluru. The RLV project is an important programme that will demonstrate one of the technologies needed to meet India’s ambitions of sustained human presence in space.The RLV-LEX-03, built upon RLV-LEX-02, was aimed at improving the vehicle’s performance, guidance, and landing capabilities. TOI had reported last week that, weather permitting, Isro would attempt to achieve this milestone in the development of RLV technology this week.S Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which has developed the RLV, had told TOI that compared to the previous LEX, Nair said, RLV-LEX3 will be more challenging as the “intentional cross-range error of around 500m will be tested, compared to around 150m during LEX-02 and that the velocity azimuth with respect to the runway centre was adjusted to 2°, deviating from the previous mission’s 0° alignment.On Sunday, Isro said: “RLV-LEX-03 re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions (cross range of 500 m) and more severe wind conditions. The vehicle, named 'Pushpak, was released from an IAF Chinook helicopter at an altitude of 4.5km.”From a release point, the vehicle autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centreline. “Due to its low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration, the landing velocity exceeded 320kmph, compared to 260kmph for a commercial aircraft and 280 kmph for a typical fighter aircraft.,” Isro said.After touchdown, the vehicle velocity was reduced to nearly 100kmph using its brake parachute, after which the landing gear brakes were employed for deceleration and stop on the runway.“During this ground roll phase, the vehicle utilised its rudder and nose wheel steering system to autonomously maintain a stable and precise ground roll along the runway, Isro said, adding that the mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space,” Isro said.The mission had another advancement: Implementation of an advanced guidance algorithm that can simultaneously correct errors in both the longitudinal and lateral planes — essential for the future orbital re-entry mission. This decoupled algorithm, an improvement over LEX-02’s approach, will be utilised to enhance the reusable launch vehicle’s precision and control.“The RLV-LEX uses multisensor fusion including sensors like inertial sensor, radar altimeter, flush air data system, pseudolite system and NaviC. Notably, the mission reused the winged body and flight systems as such without any modification, from the LEX-02 mission, demonstrating the robustness of Isro’s capability of design to reuse flight systems for multiple missions,” Isro said.This mission simulates the approach & landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, which will reaffirm Isro’s expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of an RLV.","The test was conducted at 7.10am at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) at Challakere in Chitradurga district, 220km from Bengaluru.

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR/PUNE: OBC activists Laxman Hake and Navnath Waghmare suspended their indefinite hunger strike on its tenth day on Saturday following a written assurance from state govt on the protection of reservations for the community.On Saturday, a second state govt delegation, led by food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, met the agitators at Wadigodri village with the govt's written assurance, stating that none of the backward community reservations would be diluted or affected. Suspending his strike, Hake called this a ""30-40% win"".Bhujbal, however, warned his own govt that the fight to safeguard the OBC rights has only been temporarily halted, and it would continue till the community gets justice.Chief minister Eknath Shinde, who was in Nashik, also thanked Hake for withdrawing his strike. He said govt was committed to resolving the OBC-Maratha reservation issue amicably. ""We will soon convene an all-party meeting soon to discuss and resolve the issue in the interest of all the people of the state,"" he said.The state delegation also visited Pune to convince OBC activist Mangesh Sasane, who too was observing a hunger strike. While Hake and Sasane withdrew their hunger strikes, Bhujbal said that the fight was not over yet.Addressing OBC supporters in Pune, Bhujbal said, ""This fight is far from over. We have a long way to go. Though Hake and Sasane have withdrawn their hunger strikes, the agitation has only been halted. When we feel that OBCs are facing injustice, the fight will resume.""He added that issuance of OBC certificates to the Maratha community members would not be accepted. ""We have observed that Kunbi certificates to the Maratha community members have been issued without adequate verification. This is nothing but a backdoor entry into the OBC quota. We will not allow this. We will raise the issue in the all-party meeting,"" Bhujbal said. Accusing the opposition of politicising the Maratha-OBC issue, he said, ""I warned those parties not to use the issue in the election agenda. Elections will come and go, but due to politicisation of the issue, several generations will suffer consequences.""On Friday, a first state govt delegation had met the two OBC activists but had failed to convince them to end their hunger strike. As a result, govt sent a second delegation.

We have also been assured that govt employees issuing bogus Kunbi certificates as well as those receiving them will be prosecuted.""After calling of the strike, Hake and Waghmare were admitted to a hospital in Jalna.In Wadigodri, Bhujbal, without naming Maratha activist Manoj Jarange, said, ""When will the injustice against us end? Their bullying will not be tolerated. Quota is not for wiping out poverty. It is for bringing the backward communities into the mainstream.""

Pilgrims faced extreme heat during the annual Haj pilgrimage in Mecca, resulting in multiple deaths. The Saudi General Authority for Statistics expected over 1.8 million participants this year.

52C at Mecca: 13 Keralite haj pilgrims among 922 dead

Minister Abdurahiman reports 13 Keralites died in scorching temperatures during Mecca pilgrimage, demanding Centre's intervention to solve problems faced by pilgrims. He addresses Union ministers and Consulate General about pilgrims' difficulties in Saudi Arabia, including complaints about negligence in activities of mutawwifs and poor accommodation in Assisi.

HYDERABAD: With limited buses to ferry them, many Haj pilgrims said that they had to walk for over 40km, even as temperatures touched 52 degree Celsius.Speaking over phone from Saudi Arabia, Hyderabad resident Md Fareed told TOI that many pilgrims had developed blisters on their feet, were running high temperature , suffered sunstroke, and fainted mid-way owing to the scorching heat .“The lack of buses only compounded the problem. We walked for over 7.5 km to reach Arafat from Mina,” said Fareed, adding, “I got blisters on my feet and my wife fainted as we walked for over 40km during the pilgrimage .”The Musheerabad resident is among the 300 who have completed their Haj and are waiting to board flights back to their home country this weekend.Many pilgrims from Telangana said that they had to wait for 8 to 10 hours for buses to arrive. “The main problem was with transportation. Hundreds of pilgrims from the city had to wait for hours to get a bus. Many even fainted during the wait,” said one of the 41 khadims, who travelled from Hyderabad to assist Hajis.He also claimed that they had to walk for long hours without food and water. “As a result, many pilgrims, especially those who are diabetic and have blood pressure issues, suffered during their pilgrimage,” he added.While Telangana State Haj Committee officials agreed to lack of amenities on day 1, they said that they were resolved subsequently. “There was an issue with food and accommodation initially as most of the buildings are used only during Haj. It took us about 18 hours to get them resolved. Moreover, many had to wait for over eight hours to board a bus to perform Haj,” said Shaik Liyakat Hussain, CEO, Haj Committee.Officials said the problem with transportation arose as the contract this time was given to two agencies instead of one like every year. “Also, the buses were getting stuck in traffic as lakhs of pilgrims were at Haj,” the official added.","Saudi health official Jameel Abualenain reported no abnormal deaths during Haj.

She realised the fraud when she tried to withdraw the Rs 30 lakh that reflected on the trading website as profit she had earned on her initial investment.

Oshiwara police on Wednesday filed an FIR against an unidentified person under IPC sections for impersonation and cheating and under the IT Act section for identity theft. Police said the scamsters had used deepfake technology to create the video. Police are in touch with nodal officers of banks to block the money that she was made to transfer, an officer said.

Patil said she came across the video on Instagram and was convinced by seemingly legitimate endorsement. She invested her money after researching online, which showed the company had offices in BKC and London.

Renukaswamy murder case: Loafers Darshan kicked his fan with found in wife’s flat; clothes seized,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/renukaswamy-murder-case-loafers-darshan-kicked-his-fan-withfound-in-wifes-flat-clothes-seized/articleshow/111098565.cms,"Given to Vijayalakshmi

BENGALURU: In a midnight operation , police probing the Renukaswamy murder case retrieved Sandalwood actor Darshan's loafers, allegedly used in the crime, from his wife Vijayalakshmi 's flat at Hoskerehalli in south Bengaluru.Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , and his aides, on June 8. On Saturday, police had sought extension of the accused's custody, saying they had to seize Darshan's clothes and shoes as they were crucial evidence.Police initially thought that Darshan's clothes and footwear could be found either in his house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar or at Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli. They had not factored in the possibility of any of this material ending up in the house of the actor's wife, with whom his ties are said to be anything but cordial.According to sources, Darshan told his interrogators that he had kept the clothes and footwear he was wearing on the day of the crime in his RR Nagar residence. Police were hoping to find Renukaswamy's bloodstains on it.A team of police and FSL officials took Darshan and his aide Pavan K to his residence at Ideal Township in RR Nagar at 11.15pm Saturday. Darshan's employee Babul Khan opened the door. As informed by Darshan, police rummaged through a plastic bin on the first floor, but in vain. Darshan and Khan told them that there are possibilities that the domestic help might have taken the clothes for washing to the terrace. The blue jeans trousers of True Religion brand and a black round-neck T-shirt of Opium Valley brand, which the actor was wearing on the day of the crime, were found on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan took them to the ground floor and showed them a cupboard near the sitting room. But the loafers weren't there.Sources said Pavan told police that the footwear may have been taken to Mysuru by Darshan's costume assistant Raju when he went for shooting. Police contacted Raju over phone at 12.56am and went near his house in Attiguppe. He informed police that he had given a few clothes, shoes and other valuables of Darshan to his wife Vijayalakshmi. Police immediately contacted Vijayalakshmi, who replied that there were a few shoes of her husband at her home.According to sources, Vijayalakshmi asked police not to visit her flat as it was past midnight and she had a minor son at home. She informed police that she would bring all of Darshan's shoes near the apartment security room and they could check them there.Officials rushed to the Hosakerehalli apartment with Darshan. When police personnel reached the security room, Vijayalakshmi had kept a few shoes and other footwear there. Darshan identified the blue loafers he had worn that day. FSL officials seized them.Police commissioner B Dayananda told media that his team is working hard to ensure justice is delivered to the victim's family.","Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda, and his aides, on June 8.

Fast bowler Pat Cummins led the bowling unit with a hat-trick and David Warner 's unbeaten half-century ensured no hiccups with the bat as Australia cruised to a win over Bangladesh in their 'Super 8s' match in Group 1 of the T20 World Cup , even as rain threatened to play spoilsport in Antigua on Friday (IST).Australia secured a 28-run victory over Bangladesh via the DLS method, thanks to the exceptional performances of Cummins and leg-spinner Adam Zampa before Warner & Co took charge of the run-chase.Cummins claimed the tournament's first hat-trick in the final overs, while Zampa showcased his precision in the middle overs, as Bangladesh were restricted to 140 for 8 after being asked to bat first by Mitchell Marsh.Australia's chase was led by the experienced Warner, who smashed an unbeaten 53 off just 35 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Along with Travis Head (31), Warner got the Aussies off to a flying start, racing to 60/0 before rain interrupted play.Despite losing some momentum after the break, with young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2/23 in 3 overs) dismissing Head and Mitchell Marsh (1) in quick succession, Australia remained in control. Warner, playing in his last T20 World Cup, brought up his half-century with a majestic six, showcasing his dominance.When rain stopped play for the second time, Australia were comfortably ahead of the DLS par score, with 100 for 2 in 11.2 overs, 28 runs ahead of the required target of 72. The victory showcased the depth and quality of the Australian team, as they continue their march ahead in the tournament strongly.In the opening over of the match, Mitchell Starc, the left-arm pacer, provided Australia with the anticipated early breakthrough by dismissing Tanzid Hasan. With this wicket, Starc surpassed Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga to become the leading wicket-taker in World Cups with 95 scalps.The innings was stabilized by Litton Das (16) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (41), who put together a 58-run partnership. In the fourth over, Shanto hit a six off Josh Hazlewood over long-on. He then targeted Starc, hitting a couple of fours in the fifth over.However, Zampa immediately ended the partnership, trapping Das leg before wicket in the ninth over. Australian spinners Zampa and Glenn Maxwell applied pressure on Bangladesh, restricting them to only 26 runs from the ninth to the 13th over while also dismissing Rishad Hossain (2) besides taking the crucial wicket of Shanto, who fell to Zampa.Hridoy (40 off 28) helped Bangladesh surpass the 100-run mark and attempted to boost his team's total. He hit consecutive sixes off Marcus Stoinis. However, Cummins made a significant impact in the latter stages of the innings, dashing any hopes of a strong finish by Bangladesh.At the end of the 18th over, Cummins took wickets off successive deliveries. Mahmudullah tried to play a pull shot but ended up playing the ball back onto his stumps. Cummins then had Mahedi Hasan caught by Zampa. He returned to bowl the final over and dismissed Hridoy with his first ball, completing the hat-trick -- the first of this T20 World Cup.",Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs in Group 1 of T20 World Cup in Antigua. Fast bowler Pat Cummins took a hat-trick and David Warner hit an unbeaten 53. The Aussies reached 100-2 in 11.2 overs before rain stopped play for the second time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111156855,imgsize-52336,width-400,resizemode-4/111156855.jpg"

People are not getting answers to these questions.""The announcement came moments after the Centre replaced the National Testing Agency's director general amid the NEET-NET paper leaks row. The high-level shake-up comes a day ahead of the retest of 1,563 NEET candidates.The Centre removed NTA director general Subodh Kumar Singh from his post and put him on ""compulsory wait"" in DoPT amid recent irregularities in exams including NEET and UCG-NET.Meanwhile, Pradeep Singh Kharola has been given additional charge of the post of Director General, National Testing Agency (NTA) by the ministry.Earlier in the day, the ministry of education constituted a high-level committee of experts to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations amid the NEET and UGC-NET row.

As against this, Bihar Police's investigation so far shows that the ""leak"" remained confined to Patna.Spelling out the stand, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that the govt does not intend to hurt the career and future of meritorious students only to buy peace with the protesters and opposition parties who have been demanding the scrapping of the test.""As custodian of the interests of students, we have to take a judicious approach to investigate the irregularity and how it happened, punish those involved, ensure that there is no repeat while also ensuring that the meritorious students who have done no wrong are not unfairly penalised,"" said the minister.Denying that paper leak was the reason for the postponement of CSIR-UGC-NET, a test conducted to determine eligibility for junior research fellowship and assistant professor and admission to PhD in science courses, Pradhan said: ""There was no leak in CSIR-UGC NET.

Appreciating Bihar Police and Gujarat Police for their pre-emptive action, he said: ""We must remember stakes of many meritorious students are on the cards. And also the Supreme Court is monitoring the matter."" The controversy around NEET-UG is multi-dimensional.

"Eye on China, India to help Bangladesh conserve Teesta river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-to-help-bangladesh-conserve-teesta-river/articleshow/111196158.cms,"Top Picks For You Hasina's visit reflects deep ties: President Droupadi Murmu

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas.

NEW DELHI: Cracking the whip on latecomers , the Centre's department of personnel and training (DoPT) has decided to condone a maximum delay of 15 minutes, and instructed employees across the country to be in office latest by 9.15am and mark their attendance. All employees, including senior officers, have been told to use the biometric attendance system, something several of them have not been using ever since the Covid outbreak four years ago.Staff members have been cautioned that half-day casual leave will be deducted in case they do not turn up by 9.15 in the morning. ""For any reason, if the employee is not able to attend office on a particular day, it should be informed in advance and casual leave should be applied for,"" the circular said, adding that officers will monitor the attendance and punctuality of employees in their sections.Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior-level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public-facing jobs, inconveniencing people.Senior officers complain that they do not have any fixed office hours as they usually leave after 7pm. Besides, they argue that post-Covid, with access to electronic files, they often end up working from home, including on holidays or over the weekend. Soon after coming to office in 2014, Modi govt had sought to enforce office timings , which was resisted by employees, many of whom argued that they travel long distances.Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance system was monitored to ensure that people were on time, until Covid led to suspension of the mechanism. Several senior officers had installed biometric devices on their table to avoid standing in queues to mark their attendance.The latest directive refers to instructions issued last year which had asked central govt employees to revert to biometric attendance, which was resumed in Feb 2022. ""Habitual late coming and early leaving of office should be viewed seriously and discouraged. Action against the same may be initiated,"" it had said.In departments, where IT-enabled faceless mechanism of dealing with public has been put in place, several employees routinely skip office or come in for a short while. The move is expected to enforce greater discipline but will also annoy employees who routinely walk in at 10am or even after that.","Central govt offices are open from 9am to 5.30pm but it is normal for junior- level employees to turn up late and leave early, including those in public- facing jobs.

Opposition bloc may pull out from panel to aid pro tem Speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-bloc-may-pull-out-from-panel-to-aid-pro-tem-speaker/articleshow/111196030.cms,"NEW DELHI: In continued aggression from the opposition that signals turbulence in the new Parliament , the anti-BJP bloc INDIA is likely to pull out its three members from the panel to assist the pro tem Speaker in protest against the govt “superseding” seniormost member in Lok Sabha K Suresh of Congress for the ceremonial post, which administers oath to the new MPs. Bhartruhari Mahtab of BJP has been named the pro tem Speaker.The new irritant in opposition-govt relationship came Saturday even as Congress demanded Modi regime put the three criminal laws on hold and undertake detailed discussions in Parliamentary committee and the two Houses to iron out their flaws.The three laws are up for implementation from July 1, and DMK and TMC have already asked the govt to defer them.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, were “bulldozed” through Parliament when 146 MPs had been suspended from LS and RS. He said they were “bulldozed” through the standing committee on home affairs without detailed interactions with stakeholders across the country and by ignoring dissent notes of MPs.With NEET/paper leaks and law on MSP already emerging as flashpoints ahead of Parliament session, opposition’s belligerence on criminal laws and on pro temSpeaker makes the mix a recipe for confrontation. Congress has alleged that Suresh, a Dalit member, has been ignored for pro tem Speaker’s post “for reasons other than merit”, and a boycott of the ceremonial functions by Suresh (Congress), Sudip Bandopadhyay (TMC), T R Baalu (DMK) will kick off the new LS on a sour note Monday. All indications are that the bitterness of the 17th LS is spilling over into the new one.While the pro tem post is only ceremonial, growing protest across parties against the three laws just ahead of their coming into force suggests a concerted action by INDIA constituents to force govt’s hand. The Modi regime passed the laws despite opposition protests last year, but the renewed aggression of the anti-BJP bloc appears a signal to Modi govt that it cannot ignore the rivals after their improved numbers post-poll.","Anti-BJP bloc INDIA is likely to pull out its three members from the panel to assist the pro tem Speaker in protest against the govt ""superseding"" seniormost member in Lok Sabha K Suresh of Congress for the ceremonial post.

A video of loco pilot Ajay Kumar and his assistant Ranjit Kumar, putting their lives at risk to ensure safety of passengers and preventing a potential train mishap, went viral on social media on Saturday. The incident happened on Thursday when the Narkatiaganj-Gorakhpur passenger train came to an abrupt halt on the rail bridge between Valmikinagar and Paniahwa due to a technical issue.

Samastipur divisional railway manager (DRM) Vinay Srivastava said the locomotive pilots quickly identified the problem as a leakage in air pressure. “Although reaching the spot was extremely challenging and posed a significant risk to their lives, the loco pilots remained composed and used their presence of mind. They precariously crawled along the bridge’s edge, tightly gripping it with their hands, to access the area beneath the locomotive. Once there, they successfully plugged the air pressure leakage,” the DRM said. In recognition of their “remarkable courage”, the railway administration has announced a cash reward of Rs 10,000 and commendation certificates for the two loco pilots.

The PM has in the past regularly participated in the Eurasian bloc's summit meetings but the fact that Parliament session will continue till July 3 is believed to be one of the reasons for Modi deciding to give it a miss this time.

Apart from having a possible bilateral with President Vladimir Putin, Modi was also expected to come face to face with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif at the summit for the first time since taking over as PM for the third time earlier this month.

Given the state of relations with both countries, Modi perhaps won't mind not having any sort of engagement with Xi and Sharif. India, however, has said in the past it attaches great importance to SCO for peace, stability and economic development of the region.

Modi had in 2018 coined the SECURE acronym that stands for Security; Economy and Trade; Connectivity; Unity; Respect for Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity; and Environment. Despite its full membership of SCO, India remains an outlier in the group in the sense that it's the only member to not endorse China's BRI and to not have any bilateral engagement with Pakistan. India has used the SCO platform to repeatedly remind member-states, particularly Pakistan and China, that one of the original mandates of the group was to fight terrorism and that connectivity initiatives must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.

The SCO summit was hosted by India last year but in a virtual mode. India held the SCO chairmanship last year.

","PM Narendra Modi will not attend the SCO summit in Kazakhstan on July 3-4. India is the only country in the group not to have a bilateral with China or Pakistan.
