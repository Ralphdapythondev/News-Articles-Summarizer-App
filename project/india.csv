S Jaishankar likely to meet his Bangladesh counterpart at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/s-jaishankar-likely-to-meet-his-bangladesh-counterpart-at-un/articleshow/113539887.cms,"Also read:

External affairs minister S Jaishankar may meet his Bangladesh counterpart Touhid Hossain next week, as both sides remain in touch diplomatically to finalise the proposed meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. Jaishankar is expected to use the meeting to underscore the need to quickly restore law and order in the country, express concern over the threat to minorities, particularly Hindus , while also reaffirming India’s commitment to work with a democratic and peaceful Bangladesh despite the recent tensions in ties.Jaishankar-Hossain talks will likely be the first high-level, in-person engagement between India and the interim government in Dhaka since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina. India has so far not officially ruled out a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus but it looks unlikely apparently because of scheduling constraints.Modi will address the UN Summit of the Future on September 23 and leave for India the same day. Jaishankar, however, will be in New York to deliver India’s national statement at the UNGA on September 28.The meeting will be closely followed to also see what issues Hossain raises with India. Both Hossain and Yunus have suggested that Bangladesh wants Hasina extradited but Dhaka has to do a lot of paperwork before approaching India with an official extradition request. However, with key political parties like the BNP also seeking Hasina’s extradition, her extended stay in India is unlikely to help India’s efforts to get the relationship back on to an even keel.The Indian government has also taken note of some of the “unhelpful’’ remarks made by a few of the top functionaries of the interim government, starting with Yunus himself. The chief advisor has twice said that the issue about attacks on minorities are exaggerated, calling upon India to not remain captivated by the “narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist’’ or that Bangladesh is safe with only Hasina at the helm.India is also wary of the interim government’s efforts to, as Hossain said in an interview this week, build a normal relationship with Pakistan after Hasina’s exit. Yunus has sought a revival of SAARC, which remains stalled because of India’s opposition to cross-border terrorism, and reports from Dhaka say he’s likely to have a bilateral meeting with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif in New York next week.","Jaishankar-Hossain talks will likely be the first high-level, in-person engagement between India and the interim government in Dhaka since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.

UP medical aspirants converting religion to secure MBBS seats: A look at NEET UG admission criteria around minority reservation rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/up-medical-aspirants-converting-religion-to-secure-mbbs-seats-a-look-at-neet-ug-admission-criteria-around-minority-reservation-rules/articleshow/113364399.cms,"NEET UG Admission Criteria and Minority Reservation Explained

What is the Application Process for Minority Quota in NEET Counselling

A startling case has surfaced in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, where more than a dozen medical aspirants allegedly underwent religious conversion to secure admission to minority medical colleges . This troubling incident, now under investigation by local authorities, is believed to contravene the provisions of the Unlawful Conversions of Religion Act of 2021 (UPPUCRA-2021).The individuals involved hail from various regions, including several districts in Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and Maharashtra. According to media reports, the Uttar Pradesh Home Department and other relevant authorities are aware of the ongoing probe.A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law. Of these, seven admissions were cancelled by the counselling board, while seven others voluntarily withdrew. The remaining six candidates, all from outside Uttar Pradesh, have had their documents forwarded to their respective states for verification before any legal action is taken. In response to the incident, the Directorate of Medical Education has instructed the counselling committee to thoroughly investigate the matter and verify the certificates submitted in various admission categories.Admissions to all undergraduate medical and dental courses across India are primarily conducted through NEET (UG). Various categories of seats are available, including those under the All India Quota, state government quotas, central institutions, deemed universities, and private medical or dental colleges. This system also includes seats under management and NRI quotas, with some institutions specifically catering to minority communities. Minority quotas in private, unaided, and aided minority medical colleges are also a crucial component of the admission process.Institutions such as AIIMS and JIPMER conduct their own admissions under specific categories, while the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) oversees the process for central institutions and deemed universities.Minority reservation criteria for NEET UG admissions are based on a complex interplay between state and central government regulations. The status of a minority community varies by state, and a separate list is maintained for All India Quota seats by the central government. State-specific criteria may also apply, requiring candidates to have attended a minority college or institution for part of their education to qualify for the reserved seats. This ensures that both regional and national considerations are balanced in the distribution of these quotas.The process for securing a seat under the minority quota in NEET counselling can differ based on the type of counselling. State counselling is typically centralised and managed by state authorities, where minority quota seats are part of the broader allocation process. Conversely, certain private or minority-run institutions conduct their own college-based counselling, requiring candidates to apply directly to the institution to claim a minority seat. Candidates participating in either of these processes must meet the specific eligibility requirements, including the submission of valid minority status certificates .For minority quota admissions, a separate merit list is created, considering NEET scores and other factors such as qualifying exam marks in some states. The selection process usually involves multiple rounds of counselling to fill any remaining seats. Upon selection, candidates must provide all relevant documentation, including NEET scores, educational certificates, and proof of minority status.In cases where an institution claims minority status, the application for a Minority Status Certificate (MSC) must first be submitted to the authority designated by the state government, as outlined by the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions. This process is critical for ensuring the proper distribution of seats under the minority reservation policy in medical admissions.","A total of 20 candidates came under scrutiny for allegedly using religious conversion certificates to secure an MBBS seat, circumventing the law.

"'Tirupati laddu ghee had pig & beef fat, fish oil': Row rages in Andhra Pradesh; TDP, YSRCP lock horns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tirupati-laddu-row-lab-reports-confirm-lard-tallow-in-ghee-supplied-for-tirumala/articleshow/113499408.cms,"TIRUPATI: The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam during the term of the YSRC govt . It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam. It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil. The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113499554,imgsize-1626091,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113499554.jpg"

Curbs imposed by FCU rule fail proportionality test: Judge

MUMBAI: Describing it as an infringement on the right to equality and freedom of speech , Bombay high court on Friday quashed the amended Information Technology rules enabling the Centre to set up its own fact check unit (FCU) and flag social media content about its functioning as 'fake, false or misleading'.Holding the FCU to be unconstitutional, Justice A S Chandurkar of the Bombay high court - who served as 'tie-breaker judge' after a division bench in Jan 2024 delivered a split verdict - described the expression, 'fake, false and misleading' as 'vague and overbroad'.""The FCU in a sense is an arbiter in its own cause,"" said Justice Chandurkar, echoing the view of Justice Patel who had on Jan 31, 2024, struck down the rule as unconstitutional for its vagueness and disproportionality. Justice Patel had differed with Justice Neela Gokhale, on the two-judge bench that heard the matter and arrived at a split verdict, thus bringing it before a third judge.Justice Chandurkar said the FCU rule would have ""a chilling effect"" on individuals as well as intermediaries; the new rule could have led to loss of 'safe harbour' against legal action for social media platforms if FCU-flagged content was not acted upon. The FCU rule is sans safeguards to prevent its abuse, said Justice Chandurkar, rejecting the Centre's stand that making the FCU's findings subject to a legal challenge was a safeguard.Striking down the Centre's proposed fact check unit, Justice A S Chandurkar of Bombay high court said there was no rationale to undertake an exercise in determining whether information related to the business of Central govt was fake or false or misleading when in digital form but not doing the same when such information was in print.""Under the right to freedom of speech and expression, there is no further 'right to the truth', nor is it the responsibility of the State to ensure that citizens are entitled only to 'information' that is not fake or false or misleading as identified by FCU,"" HC said.Justice Chandurkar in a 99-page opinion accepted all major contentions raised by comedian Kunal Kamra and others who challenged its constitutional validity, citing its ""chilling effect"" on fundamental rights. The judge said he agreed with arguments that the rule violated Article 14 (right to equality), Article 19 (1) (a) (freedom of speech), and Article 19(1)(g) (freedom of trade) of the Constitution.The third judge's ruling renders a majority view against FCU by 2:1. The judgment to strike down the rule will be formally pronounced soon by a two-judge bench assigned the roster, one of the judges being Justice Gokhale.FCU was brought into play in April 2023 through an amendment to rules for intermediaries under IT Act of 2000. The Centre introduced it as a mechanism to flag as 'fake, false or misleading' digital content concerning the 'business' or functioning of the Centre. Kamra, followed by others including Editors Guild of India, News Broadcasters & Digital Association and Association of India Magazines challenged the decision, citing its vagueness and overbreadth and the lack of the Centre's legal capacity to split content online to fall in two categories - non-govt-related and govt-related.The rule cannot be saved by reading it down, Justice Chandurkar concluded, rejecting the Centre's contention of having ""adopted the least restrictive mode to prevent the spread"" of information that it deemed fake, false or misleading.When he first began hearing the matter in March 2024, Justice Chandurkar had declined Kamra's plea for an interim stay, pending final disposal of the challenge. The Union govt, subsequently, notified FCU. Kamra went to SC which on March 20 stayed the rule, noting constitutional issues had been raised.Justice Chandurkar said the restrictions imposed by the rule failed the proportionality test ""especially when it seeks to abridge fundamental rights, (to free speech and trade)."" He held, ""Rule 3(1)(b)(v) seeks to restrict the fundamental right... by seeking to place restrictions"" that do not align with Article 19(2) (reasonable restrictions). It is ""impermissible through the mode of delegated legislation,"" held Justice Chandurkar.""The Editors Guild of India is justified in its grievance that it is concerned with both, the print media as well as digital platforms. There is thus an infringement of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) (freedom of trade),"" said the third Judge.","The Bombay high court quashed the amended Information Technology rules enabling the Centre to set up its own fact check unit (FCU) Justice A S Chandurkar described the expression, 'fake, false and misleading' as 'vague and overbroad' He said the FCU rule would have ""a chilling effect"" on individuals as well as intermediaries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113535909,imgsize-53228,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113535909.jpg"

NEW DELHI: CBI 's complaint that it is having to contend with hostlity in the courts in West Bengal drew sharp reaction from Supreme Court which pulled it up for casting aspersions on the judiciary by branding all courts in the state as hostile, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. This amounts to contempt, it said.The agency took this ground to press for the transfer of trial in 42 cases related to post-assembly election violence in 15 districts out of West Bengal to another state.But a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal took strong exception and said that the statement was contemptuous for which action could be taken against the officer involved in filing the petition.The agency had taken the stand that the accused in post-poll violence cases being investigated by the agency had been released without hearing it.""What ground have you taken? You are bracketing all courts as hostile. Blanket averments have been made that bail is being granted without hearing you. This is casting aspersions that the entire judiciary is hostile,"" the bench told additional solicitor general S V Raju.ASG said it was not about hostility inside the court but outside and admitted that the petition was loosely drafted. He, however, insisted that transfer of trial outside WB West Bengal was needed for free and fair proceedings, leading the bench to say that the agency had to first withdraw the blanket allegation.""If we transfer matters then we are certifying there is a hostile atmosphere over all the courts in the state and courts are not functioning. Your officers may not like the judicial officer or a particular state but don't say that the entire judiciary is not functioning. The district judges, civil judges and session judges can't come here and defend themselves. It is a fit case for contempt. How can you cast aspersions on the judiciary?"" the bench said.The court allowed CBI to withdraw the petition but noted its displeasure in its order. ""Scandalous allegations have been made against all the courts in WB . Repeatedly averred that there is a hostile environment . It is very unfortunate the central agency has chosen to cast aspersions on courts in WB . Learned ASG states there was no intention to cast aspersions. However the averments are to the contrary. He seeks permission to withdraw. We make it clear that all objections to the proposed transfer are expressly kept open,"" the bench said.","CBI's complaint that it is having to contend with hostlity in the courts in West Bengal drew sharp reaction.

Reports are shocking: Tirumala Tirupathi Devastanam



Congress demands CBI probe

Karnataka govt mandates temples to use Nadani ghee for prasadam

'Lab reports confirms presence of animal fat in the ghee'



NEW DELHI: The controversy over the adulteration of laddus, part of Tirupati temple prasadam, intensified on Friday with the Centre intervening and seeking a report.Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, meanwhile, denied allegations of the use of animal fat in preparation of the Tirupati laddu during his tenure and in turn accused Chandra Babu Naidu of ""playing with the sentiments of devotees for political gains"".The YSRCP chief said that the tender process occurs every six months and the qualification criteria has not changed for decades.""The tender process occurs every six months, and the qualification criteria has not changed for decades. Suppliers must provide an NABL certificate and a product quality certificate. TTD collects samples from the ghee, and only products that pass certification are used,"" Reddy said.""TDP is politicizing religious matters. We have rejected the products in our regime 18 times,"" he added.Reddy also announced that he will be writing to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India explaining how Naidu twisted the facts and why action should be taken against him for having done so.""Ultimately, at the end of the day, I myself am writing a letter to the Prime Minister. I am also writing a letter to the Chief Justice of India. I am explaining to them as to howChandrababu Naidu twisted the facts and why action should be taken against him for having done so,"" Reddy said.The Centre sought a full report on the issue and Union health minister JP Nadda said that the government will further the matter and take suitable actionsUnion health minister JP Nadda also asked for a full report from CM Naidu and said that the government will further the matter and take suitable actionsDuring a press conference, Nadda said that he spoke to Naidu after the controversy erupted and announced speaking to state regulators for a thorough investigation""I spoke to Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu after getting information about this and took details from him. I have asked him to share the available report so that I can examine it,"" Nadda said""I will also speak to the state regulators and investigate this. Suitable action will be taken as per the food safety standards . As of now I have asked for the report and we will examine it,"" he added.Temple's executive officer Shamala Rao said that the contractors were also warned of stringent action if they supply adulterated and low-quality ghee.""When I took over as executive officer TTD, the CM expressed concern on the ghee procured and the quality of the laddu which is considered to be very sacred and offered as 'Prasadam' to Lord Venkateswara Swamy. Any deviation in the quality will cause doing 'apavithram' (doing something which is not sacred). He wanted me to take steps to ensure that the sanctity of this temple is restored including getting pure cow milk ghee. We started working on that""""We found that we don't have any internal lab to test adulteration in the ghee. There is no system to check the quality of ghee in outside labs also... The rates quoted by tenderers are unviable, they are so low that anyone can say that pure cow ghee cannot cost so less... We warned all suppliers that they will be blacklisted if the ghee supplied doesn't pass the lab test. We collected all samples and sent it to the best lab, it is government-controlled, and the reports have come and are shocking,"" he added.Rao also announced setting up a four-member expert committee to keep a check on the ghee procured by the temple.""The report says the ghee sample is adulterated with vegetable fat and also animal fat. Animal fat adulteration includes lard (pig fat), palm oil, beef tallow, and fish oil including grape seed and linseed. The ghee sample was a concoction of all this and the result was abnormally low. Pure milk fat should have a reading between 95.68 to 104.32, but all our ghee samples had values around 20, which means the ghee supplied is highly adulterated,"" he said.""We started the procedure for blacklisting and also penalising the supplier. We formed an expert committee to improve ghee supplies and also to strengthen our internal system so that we don't face this problem again... We have found suppliers who have passed the tests... We have been asked by the expert committee to set up our own lab... This problem will be solved in the future,"" he added.Andhra Pradesh Congress President YS Sharmila shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah demanding a central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into Chandra Babu Naidu's allegations and said that the issue is related to sentiments and faith of millions of devotees and""Yesterday, Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu told that the earlier government was involved in the adulteration of prasadam. This relates to the sentiment, emotions and faith of crores of people, not only in Andhra Pradesh but also all over the country and even internationally,"" Andhra Pradesh Congress President YS Sharmila said.""N Chandrababu Naidu presented a report that said a sample was taken on the day that he assumed power and this sample reported that there is beef tallow and fish oil also in the ingredients that were used to make the laddus, the prasadam in Tirupati. We do not understand why Chandrababu Naidu made this so casual,"" she added.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi also called for a thorough probe into the controversy and said that authorities across India must protect the sanctity of religious spaces.Taking to X, Gandhi said that the issue hurt every devotee and needs to be thoroughly investigated.""The reports about the defilement of the Prasad at Sri Venkateshwara temple in Tirupati are disturbing. Lord Balaji is a revered deity for millions of devotees in India and across the world. This issue will hurt every devotee and needs to be thoroughly looked into,"" Gandhi said.""Authorities across India have to protect the sanctity of our religious spaces,"" the Congress leader added.Amid the ongoing controversy, Karnataka government on Friday issued a directive for notified temples across the state to use 'pure Nandini ghee' for preparing prasadam and other services.In a letter issued to all the district collectors, religious endowment department and other officials, the government directed to maintain the quality of the prasadam prepared in the temples.""All notified temples under the Karnataka State Religious Endowment Department are instructed to use only Nandini ghee mandatorily for services, lamps, and all types of prasadam preparation, as well as in the Dasoha Bhavan,"" the letter read.""Additionally, it is directed to maintain the quality of the prasadam prepared in the temples,"" it added.This comes a day after Telugu Desam Party cited a laboratory report supporting the claims made by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu regarding the use of animal fat in the preparation of the renowned Tirumala laddu during the tenure of the previous government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP).A lab test report confirmed the presence of animal fat in the ghee used to prepare the famous Tirumala laddu during the term of the previous YSRCP government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.According to the report, fish oil, beef tallow and lard was found in the sample of the prasad during the examination.Earlier, Andhra Pradesh CM Naidu accused the previous YSRCP government of mixing animal fat in the ghee used to prepare the prasad during its term.""They (YSRCP govt) have spoiled the quality of the free food service and did not even leave Lord Venkateswara's laddu by using substandard ingredients,"" he said.Naidu said that he was astonished to find that poor quality material was used to prepare Lord Venkateswara's 'prasadam.'","Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy denied allegations of the use of animal fat in preparation of the Tirupati laddu.

But his lament runs a dagger deep through the heart.Aamir Nazir (29) is an engineer from Kashmir University, a 2020 graduate, who is making a living by selling tea and snacks on a highway passing through the 'Ganderbal garage' area.He banks on good local traffic and booming tourism to Sonmarg. ""I am still doing something. I was an average student. But even the toppers of my batch are without jobs,"" he said. And to underline, Aamir is vocal about Article 370 Special status for J&K, under whose shadow is unfolding the 2024 assembly election, evokes strong emotions. But for youngsters like Aamir, the junked provision is as utilitarian as a livelihood question. ""Article 370 reserved jobs and land for us. It's important for my generation,"" he reasoned.Throughout the region, the anger over nullification of Article 370 has triggered the people to rush to voting booths in hordes. But it is also a sentiment that connects with the cry for jobs and incomes echoing from Anantnag to Srinagar to Ganderbal.Aamir claims he cannot compete with engineering graduates from Delhi and that posts advertised in J&K are attracting those settling in Jammu. He insists it's true.The fate of Article 370 has appeared sealed over the last five years. But along the highways and in cities and towns of Kashmir, there is no dearth of those who claim that ""protection of jobs and land exist in many states like Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand"".There are sharp concerns about the cultural dimensions of existence sans the special status but people are also eagerly hoping that a new govt will help the youth stand on their feet.Amid discussions over the fate of National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah , Mohd Sultan, who heads a 'transport union' in Ganderbal, said, ""The job scene is bad. Educated are without work. And, prices are high. Life is very difficult.""Desperate for an elected govt for the last six years and facing routine difficulties, people in villages and towns alike are waiting for the installation of local MLAs whom they can approach with their problems. It will be interesting to see what MLAs, ministers and govt would face post October 8, given the mounting grievances over jobs, electricity, roads, jailed youth, schools etc.""We want our govt and MLAs. That is the reason why voting will be high,"" said Sultan, seconded by Abdul Qadar and Mohd Yaseen. It is a view expressed by Mohd Saleem in Bijbehara and Tahir in Srinagar. High voting in Kashmir has a reason, and it is the desperation for an open door of an elected representative where residents can go and plead with hope, and leave with optimism, true or misplaced. Aamir said he appeared for panchayat assistant exam that was clouded by paper leak allegations and for engineer's post by the Service Selection Board in 2023 which he did not pass.""I worked as a delivery boy for one and a half years and saved Rs 60,000 to start this shop,"" Aamir said, carrying a tray of fresh pastries.Call it the swelling pride of a trier, or wrenching regret of a failure.","Aamir Nazir (29) is an engineer from Kashmir University, a 2020 graduate, who is making a living by selling tea and snacks on a highway passing through the 'Ganderbal garage' area.

She frequently complained about her work situation, and her parents even took her to a cardiologist in July. The doctor confirmed that while she was healthy, she lacked adequate sleep and proper nutrition.Additionally, Joseph said that the letter written by his wife to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani was intended to prevent similar incidents from happening to others in the future, even though their daughter had died. The family has decided not to pursue legal action against the company.The Union labour ministry ordered a probe to look into the circumstances surrounding Anna's death.Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday said an investigation is underway. ""Based on the findings of the probe, necessary action will be taken,"" Mandaviya told reporters.His deputy Shobha Karandlaje said on microblogging platform X that a thorough probe into the allegations ""of an unsafe and exploitative work environment is underway.""""We are committed to ensuring justice & the labour ministry has officially taken up the complaint,"" she said while responding to a post by former minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who had reposted TOI's post on Anna's mother Anita Augustine's letter to EY chairman Rajiv Memani that alleged workplace stress.Meanwhile, in response to the incident, Memani denied claims that ""work pressure"" was the cause of Anna Perayil's death, highlighting that EY has approximately 100,000 employees across India.""There is no doubt each one has to work hard (but) we don't believe work pressure could have claimed her life,"" he said.EY's India office released a statement on Thursday expressing their sorrow over Ms. Perayil's passing and extending their deepest condolences to her family.The company, which is currently under government investigation for potentially fostering an ""unsafe and exploitative work environment"", has pledged to identify methods to enhance and maintain a healthy workplace.The letter written by Perayil's mother to Memani has stirred outrage and intense discussions, both online and in the media, regarding the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The letter urged EY India to reassess a work culture that ""seems to glorify overwork while neglecting the very human beings behind the role"".""She was full of life, dreams, and excitement for the future. EY was her first job, and she was thrilled to be part of such a prestigious company.

Article 216

: Jharkhand to SC

NEW DELHI: In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre for its ""deliberate and wilful"" delay in implementing the SC collegium 's July 11 resolution recommending appointment of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao as chief justice of the state, reported.In its petition, the Hemant Soren govt said the state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19.It said the SC's five-member collegium led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, anticipating the vacancy, had recommended to the Centre to transfer the Himachal Pradesh HC CJ to Jharkhand HC as its CJ.It said despite the passage of more than two months, the Union govt was deliberately sitting over the SC collegium's recommendation, a situation that displayed the Centre's complete disregard for the highest court's decisions.Jharkhand govt said Centre's deliberate inaction on the collegium resolution was also in violation of Article 216 of the Constitution, which says, ""Every high court shall consist of a chief justice and such other judges...""Constitutional courts are empowered to initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone who wilfully disobeys or ignoresjudicial orders of such courts. However, it is to be seen whether SC collegium resolutions can be put on the same pedestal as judicial orders to attract provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act if the Union govt disagrees or delays implementation.Seeking to push swift implementation of the collegium's recommendations, retired SC judge Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had warned Centre of contempt of court proceedings but refrained from acting on the caution.SC, through three judgments in the 1990s, made the collegium the sole arbiter in appointments of judges to the apex court and HCs but it has not spelt out the timeframe within which the recommendations are to be implemented. Moreover, while the Centre cannot refuse to comply with the collegium's decision, it can seek a review by flagging issues which it feels escaped the attention of the body or did not get adequate consideration.Information about Jharkhand moving a contempt petition against Centre was shared by CJI Chandrachud with attorney general R Venkataramani when the top law officer was requesting adjournment of Friday's hearing on a PIL by Harsh Vibhor Singh, who sought time-bound implementation of the collegium's recommendations for appointment & transfer of HC judges.The AG told the bench of CJI and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra he would provide details on appointment of CJs to HCs next week. SC asked the AG to renew the request for adjournment on Friday as the case was already listed.Apart from recommending transfer of Justice Rao from Himachal Pradesh high court to Jharkhand, the SC collegium on July 11 had passed a resolution for appointment of chief justices to seven HCs. However, the Centre cited certain ""sensitive material"" to request the collegium to reconsider certain recommendations.Based on the material, the collegium on Sept 17 had changed its proposals on appointment of CJs to three HCs - Himachal Pradesh (after the retirement of Justice Rajiv Shakdher), Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.","In a first, Jharkhand government has moved Supreme Court seeking contempt of court action against the Centre. The state was without a chief justice for two months, since the retirement of Justice B R Sarangi on July 19.

The listed terrorist had also threatened that Air India would not be allowed to operate globally.NIA's action comes a day after a civil lawsuit was filed by Pannun in the US against high-ranking Indian officials claiming that there was a conspiracy orchestrated by Indian officials to assassinate him, which he alleges was thwarted when the hired hitmen turned out to be undercover US agents.Reacting to the summons, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""As we have said earlier, these are completely unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations. Now that this particular case has been lodged. It doesn't change our views about the underlying situation.""""I would only invite your attention to the person behind this particular case whose antecedents are well known.

The boy who could do no wrong

KOZHIKODE: A man from Wayanad who briefly trained for the clergy before migrating to Norway in search of greener pastures has emerged as an alleged link in the sensational pager explosions in Lebanon on Tuesday that targeted Hezbollah fighters and killed 12 people, including civilians, and injured dozens.Norta Global Ltd, based in Sofia, Bulgaria - allegedly owned by Rinson Jose (37) of Wayanad, now a Norwegian citizen - is being probed by international security agencies following reports linking it to the sale of hundreds of pagers.Central intelligence agencies and Kerala Police special branch collected details on Friday about Rinson from his native village, Ondayangadi, near Mananthavady, Wayanad. Wayanad district police chief Taposh Basumathary said police had done a normal background check. ""Now that the identity and details of the family have come out in the media, police have taken steps to ensure they are safe. We are patrolling the area,"" he said.Family sources said Rinson, son of Moothedath Jose and Gracy, who used to work as tailors, had gone abroad with his twin brother, who now works in the UK. His sister is a nurse in Ireland. He lives in Norway with his wife and had last come home in Nov 2023 and returned in Jan 2024.""Rinson last spoke to his family here three days ago. They haven't been able to contact him on the phone since. We tried calling Rinson's wife on Friday as well, but no one answered. The news reports about him are unbelievable; he could also have been deceived,"" Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, told TOI.Hungarian media reported that Norta Global had facilitated the sale of the pagers. The firm's website - which described it as a leading technology company with strong focus on consulting, technology and payment integration, recruitment & outsourcing - has been taken down now.However, Bulgaria's State Agency for National Security said that Norta Global and its owner had ""not carried out any transaction linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise"" or that which ""falls under laws on terrorism financing"".Reuters had reported on Thursday that Norta's Bulgarian headquarters was registered at an apartment building near Sofia that was also home to nearly 200 other companies, but there was no sign of Norta.Reuters said Rinson declined to comment on the pagers when reached by phone and hung up when asked about the Bulgarian business.Amund Djuve, the CEO of DN Media, where Jose currently works, told Reuters he was aware of the reports and had alerted police and security services. He said that Jose was travelling to the US.Oslo Police said it had initiated ""preliminary enquiries into the information that had come to light"". Norway's domestic intelligence agency, PST, said it was aware of the situation and declined to comment further, Reuters reported.According to Rinson's LinkedIn page, he has been working in the Oslo-based DN Media Group in Norway for nearly five years and was involved in leading digitisation, automation, and growth across multiple brands/publications. Besides mentioning him as an entrepreneur running NortaLink, an IT service, consultancy, procurement, and recruiting company from 2016 onwards, it identifies him as co-founder of an IT recruiting and business development firm and IT recruitment firm StarCruiter. Rinson had pursued a master's in international social welfare and health policy at Oslo Metropolitan University from 2012 to 2015. The profile also claims he was general secretary of International Students Union of Norway for one year from Sept 2012.In Ondayangadi, residents of the area said they knew Rinson as an upright person, while his shocked family members said they were sure he would not do anything wrong. Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, said Rinson studied at Ondayangadi school, then went to a seminary for a year, and later continued his studies in Wayanad and Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Siddharth Garg, a biker, lost his life after his motorcycle collided with a Mahindra XUV coming from the wrong side of the road in Gurugram district. Garg’s body was handed over to his family following a post-mortem.The visuals of the crash, captured by an action camera mounted on a friend’s bike, quickly spread across social media and sparked a public outcry.The video shows Garg riding at high speed before the SUV suddenly appeared, leading to the fatal impact.According to police, Garg and his friend Pradyuman Kumar (22) left Dwarka early on Sunday morning for a ride on separate bikes. The duo first went to DLF Downtown, following which they planned to meet a group of riders at Ambience Mall. Kumar said Garg had taken all precautions and was wearing a helmet and other safety gear.Kumar was following him on another motorcycle on Golf Course Road when the accident happened near Belvedere Towers around 5.25am. A Mahindra XUV 300 car, driven by Thakur, suddenly appeared and Garg's bike collided head-on with it, Kumar said. Thakur was driving the car in the wrong direction on the one-way lane, he added.Kumar alleged that Thakur was driving on the wrong side of the road at a high speed, leading to the death of his friend. ""The SUV also had a sticker of a BJP candidate. Police didn't accept footage of the accident recorded by my GoPro camera, which I had installed on my helmet as evidence. They soon released Thakur on bail, probably due to his political connections,"" he alleged.Police have denied Kumar's claims, saying that the video footage was accepted as evidence and the driver was booked and granted bail in accordance with the law. Based on Kumar's complaint, an FIR was lodged at DLF 2 police station against Thakur under BNS sections 106 (causing death by negligence), 281 (rash driving) and 324(4) (causing damage exceeding Rs 20,000), as well as relevant sections of the MV Act. Thakur told the police that he was following Google Maps while returning from Palwal along with another person when the accident happened.In the aftermath, Garg's mother expressed her anguish, questioning the legal proceedings surrounding the accused's release on bail.""I want justice for my son,"" she said. ""A wrong person killed my son. My only question is, why was he released on bail? My son is no more, but the accused slept peacefully that night. Why are the police not helping us?""Responding to the mother’s plea, DLF Gurugram ACP Vikas Kaushik assured the family that the police are following legal procedures and invited the victim’s family to meet with the authorities for a transparent update on the investigation.""If they have doubts related to the investigation, we will make them aware of all the actions we have taken and try to satisfy their worries,"" Kaushik said.Thakur, a resident of Ghitorni and co-founder of a PR company, was booked after Akshat's friend, Pradyuman Kumar, lodged an FIR. However, he was later granted bail. A senior police officer said, ""Thakur’s medical examination was conducted, and blood samples were collected. He joined the investigation and was granted bail. We take wrong-side driving seriously and have issued over 16,300 challans for the offense in August alone. Action against violators will continue.""An FIR has been registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) based on a complaint filed by Garg's friend, Pradhuman. The accused driver has been arrested in accordance with the law. SHO Kumar said that the victim’s family has not approached the authorities to request any additional charges.Highlighting their ongoing efforts to curb wrong-side driving, the Gurugram Police in August 2024 alone, more than 16,000 challans were issued for such violations and strict action will continue.","Siddharth Garg, a biker, lost his life after his motorcycle collided with a Mahindra XUV coming from the wrong side of the road in Gurugram district.

Either way, you cannot take it lightly,"" said the ex-CRPF director general on deputation to Manipur since the ethnic conflict flared up in mid-2023.The September 16 alert from the CMO states that tribal militants ""are reportedly grouped in units of 30 members each and currently scattered on the periphery, and expected to launch multiple coordinated attacks"".The security adviser said districts and border units of Manipur Police & Assam Rifles were on maximum alert.A meeting of strategic operations group took placeon September 18. Singh said the planned measures had been communicated to the relevant agencies with a directive that any movement of militants be ""nipped in the bud"". The districts on high alert are Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Ukhrul, Kamjong and Pherzawl.Singh said traditional combing operations focus on seizing arms, but there was now ""increased scrutiny"" of materials used to manufacture rockets, missiles, drone components, and batteries.""DMs have been alerted and asked to check stocks of explosives with licensed owners. All connected roads and villages within a 5km radius of the hills are also being checked for stockpiles.""The security adviser said that of the 2,681 weapons seized by security forces since the conflict started, one-third were in the hills and two-thirds in the valley.""The availability of weapons in society in both the hills and the valley is not because of looting (from state armouries and police stations). They were already available much before (the ethnic conflict began). Single-barrel breech loaders and double-barrel breech loaders were there, some of them licensed and some manufactured illegally."""," Manipur CM N Biren Singh's office has forwarded to cops a purported intelligence alert about influx of 900-odd tribal militants from Myanmar.

Finding beauty in impermanence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finding-beauty-in-impermanence/articleshow/113520188.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Recently, I was tasked with interviewing a young musical prodigy – 19-year-old Lydian Nadaswaram – alongside my colleague, Pattimandram Raja. Upon reaching the venue, I was struck by the small room packed with violins, a Thavil, guitars and a grand piano occupying much of the floor. It felt more like an artist's sanctuary than a studio.

Some years ago, Lydian had won the ‘World’s Best Talent’ award, among other accolades. As I prepared myself for the chat, I wondered whether I should approach him like a child genius. But as soon as the recording began, however, Lydian’s presence took control, and time flew.

Born a musical genius , Lydian's parents allowed him to bypass conventional schooling in favour of his passion. His current project, an ambitious one, involves composing tunes for all 1,330 couplets of the Tirukkural. With help from his sister, Amirthavarshini, also a musician, he has already tuned over a 1000 couplets, inviting singers from across the globe. Listening to them was a soul-stirring musical experience where we all felt Valluvar honoured.

What struck me even more than Lydian’s talent was his unwavering dedication to this project, despite the allure of more glamorous opportunities. When asked about his favourite couplet, he cited couplet 331 from the chapter on impermanence:

Nilladha Vatrai Nilayina Endrunarum

Pullari Vaannmai Kadai

""Dishonourable amongst intellects is the one who trusts as secure,

In things that shall pass away, as though they eternally endure.""

While Kural is full of verses on love, fame, friendship, and fortune, his choice was striking. I asked him the reason, and he explained that amidst everything that is transient, he wanted to leave behind a legacy.

It led me to reflect on the idea of impermanence, a concept present in all religious philosophies. Buddhism, for instance, speaks of the transient and evanescent nature of all things—whether physical or emotional. Acceptance of this truth can transform one's view of life.

Often, I hear freshers seeking ‘permanent positions’. When organisations aren’t permanent, how can any position be? Yet, human nature craves permanence, for it offers a sense of security. Oscar Wilde once said, ""Nothing in the world is permanent. We are foolish to ask anything to last, but surely, we are more foolish not to delight in its brief existence.”

At Japan’s Ise Shrine, a marvel of architecture, visitors are told the shrine has existed since 685 BCE, yet it is also only 20 years old. This is because the shrine is rebuilt every two decades, using the same materials and style, as a living symbol of ephemerality.

Narada once questioned Krishna about the nature of illusion and impermanence. Krishna requested some water first. As Narada went to fetch it, he was distracted by a beautiful woman, fell in love, married, and had children. Years passed and a sudden flood swept away his family and village. Distraught, Narada collapsed, only to have Krishna reappear and ask, “Where is my water?” The entire episode had been an illusion—a demonstration of life’s fleeting nature.

Impermanence, however, need not lead to despair. It can transform our lives into vibrant experiences of mindfulness, urging us to savour each moment in its fullest intensity. When nothing lasts, the present becomes infinitely precious.

As we concluded the interview, Lydian’s music still lingered in the air. I reflected that while everything may fade, some things may endure—like music, like the Thirukkural.

NEW DELHI: Reigniting its tussle with the Centre for quick implementation of collegium resolutions on appointment of HC judges , Supreme Court Friday asked the latter to explain ""why some of the names recommended (for judgeship ) are pending and at which level"".Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jharkhand govt, which has filed a contempt petition for delay in implementing collegium recommendation for appointment of the last two chief justices for the state, alleged that the Centre either ""delays or maintains a stoic silence"" on appointment of judges.While dealing with a PIL for laying down a timeline for govt to implement collegium recommendations, a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud said, ""Names for appointment as chief justices of various HCs are expected to be notified soon. Let us wait till next week.""A bench led by Justice Sanjay K Kaul had, for a year prior to his retirement in Dec last year, kept the heat on Centre to expedite appointment of persons recommended by SC collegium for HC judgeship and criticised the govt's ""pick and choose"" approach.While seeking status of pendency of collegium recommended names, SC bench reminded govt Friday that ""Collegium is not a search committee. It has a certain status in the constitutional fabric. In case of a search committee's recommendation, there is an absolute discretion (with the govt) whether to accept the names or not.""Attorney general R Venkataramani said he was not sure to what extent the court could enter into a deliberation on this contentious issue.
