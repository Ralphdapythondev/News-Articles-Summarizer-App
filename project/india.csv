"20cr Indians lead 'inactive' lives, urban girls worst-hit, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/20cr-indians-lead-inactive-lives-urban-girls-worst-hit-says-study/articleshow/113046764.cms,"A first of its kind national survey on sports & physical activity reveals that over 20 crore Indians are ""inactive"" based on international norms, & that girls in cities are most inactive.Inactivity levels are based on WHO recommendations that adults should engage in at least 150mins of activity per week to mitigate health risks, anxiety and depression.Children and adolescents must be active 60 minutes per day - a number that is way off the charts for a society where parents and teachers constantly tell children that they should study first, play after.""One of the biggest myths we need to debunk is that physical activity comes in the way of academics when actually it complements and enhances academic success,"" says Swetha Totapally, regional director for Dalberg Advisors, Asia Pacific, which conducted the survey along with Sports and Society Accelerator, a non-profit organisation. ""Physical activity and sport leads to physiological changes, mood regulation, stamina and cognitive improvements - which translates into individual outcomes."" The survey suggests that a fully active India by 2047 can boost GDP by over Rs 15 trillion annually.We have to distinguish between sports and physical activity, says Desh Gaurav Sekhri, co-founder of Sports and Society Accelerator. ""In India, we have confused physical activity with sport - so the words that come to mind are medals, competition and excellence rather than health, community, productivity.""Among the most disturbing findings is gender gap in physical activity. Girls in cities are the worst hit because of the low proximity to public spaces like parks and maidans, as well as abiding fear over safety. Three-quarters of active time for the average Indian woman is consumed by household chores and caregiving to children and elders.Also, urban inactivity rates are almost twice as high compared to rural areas. There is a pressing need to integrate physical activity into schools for 67% of the students surveyed said their school did not have sports equipment, while 21% said their school did not have a playground.The survey - conducted in Maharashtra, UP, Odisha and Tamil Nadu - relied on focus group discussions with parents, blue collar workers, physical education teachers and students.","A first of its kind national survey on sports & physical activity reveals that over 20 crore Indians are ""inactive"" based on international norms, & that girls in cities are most inactive.

Hence, I took it as a challenge to write the NEET-PG exam to test my knowledge, way of learning and format,"" says Dr Deepak Vyas.""I wanted to give company and competition to my son, who passed from GMERS Gandhinagar. We studied together where I guided him in practical aspects, while he would help me with the theoretical aspects from his syllabus.""Dr Vyas said when he last appeared for the MBBS exam 28 years ago, the format was descriptive, and the MCQ format in which NEET-PG is conducted was unthinkable. ""I am from the pen and paper era when MBBS marks were considered for PG admission. Writing the exam on the computer in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format was a new experience,"" added Dr Vyas, a medical counsellor with Apollo Hospitals.The duo said that the examination was a good way to prepare for what comes next – Samisth, who wishes to pursue MD (medicine), will appear next year with better preparation to get admission in his desired field. So, the duo did not fret much about the exam or rank this year as the purpose was not to secure a seat. They had different centres for the exam, they added.The outcome was a win-win.

I understand that any infringements would attract strict action against me'.While the honour code has been in existence at the university for some time, the changes this year have raised some eyebrows on the campus.The university has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, starting with the the unofficial screening of a banned BBC movie last Jan, to the recent ban on a student collective, Progressive Students' Forum (PSF), which the institute claimed was 'unauthorised' and 'illegal'. PSF has been active on the campus for 12 years.With the signing of the new Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) early this year, the university, known for its contribution towards social work education, was brought under the ambit of the union ministry of education. The university was earlier managed by the Tata Trusts, which had its nominee as chairperson of the board. With the new MoA, the institute is now governed by the TISS Society, chaired by the union education minister. This was after the Central govt's decision to bring all institutions that receive over 50% grants from the Centre under its jurisdiction. TISS was one of them.In April this year, Ramadas K S, the former general secretary of PSF, was suspended for two years for participating in 'unlawful' and 'anti-national' activities.While his suspension matter is in the court, a TISS student said the revision in the honour code this year could be following this development. ""How can an institute's honour code precede constitutional rights?"" asked the student, adding the institute has been making these norms stringent every year. He said the validity of this code should be challenged too. This year's code mentioned that 'the undertaking is legally binding'. It also mentioned that violation of the code could lead even to expulsion.Speaking about the honour code, Medha Patkar, a respected alumna of TISS, said bringing students under such bondage will not resolve the conflict between the administration and students' community but will only worsen the situation.""Students and alumni should appeal to the administration for more dialogue. The code that students have been asked to sign is also against the basic constitutional rights. TISS alumni are known for their work in peace and non-violent work in society.

So much for free speech and press freedom!"" Malviya tweeted, questioning the chief minister's sincerity in addressing crimes against women. He further called on Banerjee to take concrete actions if she truly aims to tackle these issues, including apologising to the women of Sandeshkhali for defending Sheikh Shahjahan, a rape accused, on the floor of the West Bengal Assembly, and ensuring that Shahjahan is the first to face the death penalty under the new law.Malviya's comments came in response to Banerjee's statements in the West Bengal Assembly, where she hit back at the BJP by citing high-profile rape cases in BJP-ruled states like Unnao and Hathras. Banerjee expressed disapproval of the central government's decision to pass the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) without consulting her state and criticized the central leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, for failing to implement effective laws to protect women.Taking it to X, Mamata Banerjee said, ""A society that cannot ensure the safety of its women can never be ideal. Today, GoWB passed the historic Aparajita anti-rape Bill to address pertinent issues caused by gaps in the existing criminal laws. Let us all unite together and address this menace collectively!""Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan Tuesday slammed the anti-rape bill passed in the West Bengal assembly as a ""diversionary tactic"" and asked if Shahjahan Sheikh, the main accused in the Sandeshkhali sexual abuse case, will get the death penalty under the proposed law. Talking to reporters, Chouhan, a senior BJP leader and the Union agriculture minister, accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of being ""insensitive"" towards women.Chouhan said: ""Mamata Banerjee has become insensitive. Madhya Pradesh was the first state in the country to implement such a law in 2017, and so far, 42 people have been given the death sentence. The bill has been brought to divert attention from the heinous crime at RG Kar Medical College. Why didn't the Mamata government introduce the bill earlier? Those responsible for the RG Kar incident should receive the death penalty. Will people like Sheikh Shahjahan also face the death penalty under this bill?""Meanwhile, Union MoS and BJP leader Sukanta Majumdar said, ""Mamata Banerjee is doing 'dramabaazi'. The legislation brought today is unconstitutional. There is already a central law which has the provision of the death penalty. So the legislation brought by Mamata Banerjee today is only 'dramabaazi'. This legislation will be challenged in Supreme Court and it will be cancelled.""TMC leader Kunal Ghosh hailed the bill as a historic move by the Mamata Banerjee-led government to provide stringent punishment for rape and murder. ""History has been created in West Bengal legislative assembly. For the first time a bill has been passed by Mamata Banerjee led government to provide stringent punishment to those involved in incidents of rape and murder. The Governor of West Bengal should provide assent to the bill,"" Ghosh said.The new anti-rape bill introduced by Banerjee aims to expedite investigations, deliver swift justice, and impose stricter punishments, including the death penalty for those convicted of rape resulting in the victim's death or leaving her in a inhumane state.The bill also includes provisions for life imprisonment without parole for those convicted of rape and gang rape, as well as penalties for unauthorized publishing of court-related matters.The BJP has raised concerns over its potential impact on press freedom and transparency in judicial proceedings. Malviya urged Banerjee to remove the clause that seeks to limit media reporting on rape cases and called for the immediate establishment of fast-track courts to address crimes against women and minor girls.","BJP national spokesperson Amit Malviya said that the new legislation seeks to curtail press freedom while diverting attention from the recent rape and murder of a young doctor at RG Kar Medical College & Hospital in Kolkata.

Any alliance with AAP a bid to avoid division of votes in BJP favour: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/any-alliance-with-aap-a-bid-to-avoid-division-of-votes-in-bjp-favour-congress/articleshow/113041548.cms,"NEW DELHI: : Congress and AAP are negotiating a pact for Haryana polls, with the two parties confirming talks have already taken place and, if an agreement is hammered out, a deal may be clinched in a couple of days. It reverses the earlier stance of the INDIA allies that their Lok Sabha partnership would not extend to assembly polls in Haryana or Delhi.AAP sources said Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and AAP MP Raghav Chadha have discussed the nitty-gritties over two rounds, adding that AAP has sought 10 seats while Congress is willing to cede seven.According to sources, the two parties are confident of a pact, and the discussion is around the specific constituencies that AAP is seeking, which is different from the list of seats that Congress is offering. The tie-up hinges on a reconciliation on these seats.While Haryana Congress has been opposed to any alliance , sources said Rahul Gandhi nudged the party in the direction of cobbling an INDIA bloc.The third round of talks between Congress and AAP for a possible seat-sharing arrangement in the upcoming Haryana assembly elections is likely to take place on Wednesday.It is learned that Rahul asked participants in the Congress central election committee (CEC) meeting on Monday about an alliance with AAP, but there was barely a discussion on the issue.Congress general secretary Deepak Babaria made the surprise revelation on Tuesday afternoon when he told reporters that alliance talks were on. However, after the meeting of the CEC late evening, he said that ""the talks are in a primitive mode"" and their fate would be known in two-three days.Babaria said the alliance was to avoid any division of votes in favour of BJP which is battling serious anti-incumbency . Even Samajwadi Party (SP) of Akhilesh Yadav is being spoken of as an ally.The announcement came even as the CEC held back-to-back meetings for selection of candidates.The party's top panel cleared 32 candidates out of the 41 that were discussed on Tuesday, after having finalised 34 seats and sent 15 for review out of the 49 brought before it on Monday.A sub-committee will take a look at the pending seats. It is now believed that the pending seats could be among those being discussed between AAP and Congress.Speaking to reporters after the poll committee meeting, Babaria said there was still no decision on the candidature of wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, and a final picture would emerge in two days.AAP MP Sanjay Singh welcomed the alliance negotiations and said, ""Defeating BJP and its politics of hatred and politics against people, farmers and youth is a priority for all of us.""Meanwhile, Haryana Congress functionaries Randeep Surjewala, Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Hooda will meet soon to discuss various poll-related issues.",AAP sources say Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and AAP MP Raghav Chadha have discussed the nitty-gritties over two rounds.

""The indigenous radar integration would have proven very costly and time-consuming. The aim is to ink the contract for the 22 single-seat jets and four twin-seat trainers within this fiscal,"" a source told TOI.The main DAC takeaways were the grant of the ""acceptance of necessity (AoN)"" to the Rs 72,000 crore project to construct seven frigates, with advanced stealth features as well as the latest weapons and sensors, and the Rs 57,000 crore programme for the future ready combat vehicles (FRCVs) or tanks.The Army wants to induct the 1,770 FRCVs, with superior mobility and all-terrain ability, multilayered protection and real-time situational awareness, precision and lethal firepower, from 2030 onwards.The induction will be done in three phases, with 590 tanks in the first lot, to progressively replace the existing fleet of 2,400 Russian-origin T-72 tanks. Each phase will see induction of newer technologies to ensure the highest level of survivability, lethality and agility, as was earlier reported by TOI.The first of the seven new frigates, with a displacement of around 7,000-tonne, will also roll out only by 2031-32 at the earliest under Project-17B.

Of the total cost of AoNs accorded on Tuesday, 99% were from domestic sources under the Buy (Indian) and Buy (Indian, indigenously designed developed and manufactured) categories, the MoD said.They include procurement of air defence fire control radars, which will detect and track aerial targets and then provide a firing solution, ""forward repair team (tracked)"" vehicles, which have suitable cross-country mobility for carrying out in-situ repairs during mechanized operations by tanks and infantry combat vehicles, for the Army.The Coast Guard, in turn, will get additional Dornier-228 aircraft as well as next-generation fast patrol vessels and offshore patrol vessels with advanced technologies for enhanced long-range operations.","The Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) also approved four ""amendments"" to the over Rs 50,000-crore deal for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters currently being negotiated with France.

Country faces surge in immigration scams amidst stricter visa regulations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/country-faces-surge-in-immigration-scams-amidst-stricter-visa-regulations/articleshow/113039446.cms,"India has experienced a notable increase in immigration scams over recent years, with fraudulent agents exploiting individuals seeking to study, work, or migrate abroad. These scams have caused substantial financial and emotional distress for many victims and tarnished India’s reputation as a reliable source of skilled labor.According to the Delhi Police, the IGI Airport Police have apprehended 108 fraudulent agents in the last six months—a sharp rise from the 51 arrests made during the same period last year.This surge in criminal activity has prompted foreign governments to impose stricter visa regulations and heightened scrutiny of Indian applicants.Notable visa fraud casesHealthyway visa fraud case (2011): In Chandigarh, Healthyway Immigration was accused of visa fraud after promising guaranteed visas to Canada, the US, and Australia. Despite high fees and quick processing assurances, many victims received fake or unprocessed visas. The company’s owner, Amit Kakkar, was arrested following an investigation.Chandigarh’s fake visa racket (2018): A major scandal involved a group of travel agents in Chandigarh issuing fake visas and forging documents for individuals aiming to migrate to Canada, the US, and Australia. The high fees charged for rapid processing left many victims facing detention or entry denial.Kerala visa scandal (2023): A network of travel agents in Kerala was discovered issuing fake visas for individuals intending to migrate to countries like Australia and the UK. The agents forged documents and charged exorbitant fees, leading to numerous complaints and several arrests.Tips to avoid visa fraudTo protect yourself from such scams, start by researching the agency, checking reviews, certifications, and seeking accreditation from recognized regulatory bodies. Be cautious of agencies that guarantee visas or promise expedited processing for extra fees, as legitimate consultants cannot make such guarantees. Ensure the consultant or agency is registered with relevant immigration authorities, and consult official bodies like the Ministry of External Affairs for verification.Carefully review all documents and agreements for hidden fees or suspicious terms. Be skeptical of unusually high fees, especially if paid upfront, and compare with other reputable agencies.Use official contact methods to reach immigration agencies and avoid unsolicited emails or messages. Report any suspicious activity to local authorities or the Ministry of External Affairs.","According to the Delhi Police, the IGI Airport Police have apprehended 108 fraudulent agents in the last six months.

Assam",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-ineligible-beneficiaries-to-poor-recovery-of-funds-cag-detects-lapses-in-pm-kisan-in-assam/articleshow/113037488.cms,"GUWAHATI: Implementation of the Centre's flagship 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi' (PM-KISAN) scheme in Assam has been plagued by problems, ranging from 35 per cent of the applicants being found ineligible to the recovery of a mere 0.24 per cent of funds released to these non-entitled beneficiaries , as detected by the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ).A performance audit of the scheme from December 2018 to March 2021 found that out of the 41,87,023 applications from the state, 10,66,593 (25 per cent) were rejected by PM-KISAN portal and Public Financial Management System.Subsequently, the state government declared that 11,72,685 (37 per cent) out of the 31,20,430 beneficiaries were ineligible through an inquiry conducted from May-July 2020 across the state.A mere 0.24 per cent of the funds released to these ineligible beneficiaries were received back till October 2021, which was not refunded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the CAG report, tabled in the state assembly recently, said.The CAG report also pointed out that the inquiry initiated in May 2020 on order of the chief minister, following complaints from different quarters regarding anomalies in the beneficiaries list, had found 15,59,286 ineligible names during verification across the state from May to July 2020.Among the different categories of ineligible beneficiaries were non-farmer beneficiaries, government employees and pensioners, and multiple entries.As per the verification report, 11,31,152 (72.54 per cent) of over 15 lakh ineligible beneficiaries were found to be untraceable.When the auditors pointed to the difference in the figure of ineligible beneficiaries furnished by the state nodal officer (SNO) (11,72,685) and the one mentioned in the report of verification (15,59,286), the state government said that ""another verification was being conducted and as such, the figure was dynamic"".The audit, carried out in 10 districts selected based on saturation level of beneficiaries, found lack of monitoring and non-adherence to guidelines for the implementation of the scheme at various stages.In addition to the 10 districts, Barpeta was also selected considering the largest number of ineligible beneficiaries in the state.Twenty-two blocks from the selected 11 districts, with three villages in each block, were taken for the audit, covering 15 beneficiaries' records (totalling 990) each from the selected villages.The performance audit revealed that the state government did not maintain a database of landholding farmer families to identify potential beneficiaries.Emphasis was given to uploading a large number of beneficiaries' data within a short period of time instead of ensuring the eligibility of the beneficiaries as per provisions of the scheme.Lack of monitoring by supervisory officers also adversely affected implementation of the scheme, the audit report said.It also maintained that the audit exercise was ""adversely affected due to lack of cooperation towards furnishing records/information by the Director of Agriculture"".Analysis of SNO database by the audit detected that fake registration numbers were created by zeros at the beginning of the bank account numbers, as a result of which multiple benefits were credited to the same bank account against multiple registrations.The audit found 3,577 such registrations in 16 out of 33 districts against which Rs 3.01 crore was released, the report added.It also noticed that multiple registrations were done using the same bank account in respect of 3,104 beneficiaries in 10 districts, though no benefits were released to these beneficiaries.The audit also found that funds were released to beneficiaries with names containing jumbled letters or special characters.Scrutiny of records revealed that out of Rs 2.18 crore received towards administrative expenses, the SNO submitted utilisation certificate (UC) of only Rs 77 lakh to the Government of India, with the UCs for the remaining not furnished till October 2021.The exercise of physical verification of beneficiaries by the supervisory officers was not given the due importance in the state, which not only violated provisions of the operational guidelines but also pointed towards ineffective monitoring and supervision of implementation of the scheme in the state, the CAG report said.The state government, which accepting the audit observations, said in February 2022 that 100 per cent re-verification is being conducted since June 2021 through revenue officials under the supervision of the deputy commissioners and the Principal Secretary of the Sixth Schedule areas, the report added.","A performance audit of the scheme from December 2018 to March 2021 found that out of the 41,87,023 applications from the state, 10,66,593 (25

Aparajita Bill

?

President approval

Amid ongoing widespread protest across the nation for the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal Assembly on Tuesday passed the Aparajita Woman and Child Bill (West Bengal Criminal Laws and Amendment) Bill 2024.The bill passed by the Mamata Banerjee government, proposes stringent punishments, including the death penalty, for convicted rapists, especially in cases where the crime results in the victim’s death or leaves them in a vegetative state.The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, recently introduced criminal law by the central government.Those convicted of severe crimes could face death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. It also includes provisions for harsher sentences for repeat offenders, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.The bill provides quicker investigations, with a new three-week deadline for cases to be completed, a significant reduction from the current two-month period. However, an extension of up to 15 days could be granted under specific conditions.Additionally, the bill aims to establish a special task force called the ""Aparajita Task Force"" at the district level, led by a deputy superintendent of police. This task force would focus on handling these serious cases with the necessary resources and expertise to reduce the trauma for victims and their families.Special courts will also be set up to try these cases, and publishing any details about court proceedings without permission could result in imprisonment for up to five years, along with a fine. The bill, which will be introduced by State Law Minister Moloy Ghatak, is expected to be discussed in the state assembly soon.Criminal law in India falls under the concurrent list, meaning both state and central governments can legislate on the subject. However, for the Aparajita bill to be enacted, it must receive the President's approval.","The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023.

However, the so-called retiral benefit given by ICICI to Madhabi Buch from 2016-17 to 2020-21 averages to around Rs 2.77 crore per annum.""""How can a person's retiral benefit be more than her salary as an employee?,"" he questioned.Accusing Buch of non-compliance of the Income Tax Act, Khera said, ICICI paid TDS on ESOP on behalf of Madhabi Puri Buch.

Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%. For disposal to outweigh the institution of cases, courts must work beyond the capacity of 71-100%.""""Time has come to think of national integration by recruiting members to judicial services across narrow walls of regionalism and state-centred selections,"" he added. Centre's AIJS, proposed in 2015, had virtually no takers, as only Haryana and Mizoram govts and HCs of Tripura and Sikkim had favoured it. Others opposed it on grounds of linguistic barrier and federalism.The CJI said though women were outnumbering men in recent recruitments of judicial officers across states, sadly only 6.7% district court infrastructure are female friendly. ""Is this acceptable in a nation where basic level of recruitment in some states sees over 60-70% women joining?"" he asked & said judiciary's focus areas were on increasing accessibility measures which could be understood by carrying out infrastructure audits, opening medical facilities and creches in court and technological projects.""Inclusivity in judiciary is a reflection of our broader commitment to equality and justice. Some key measures are developing a comprehensive framework for gender equality in decision making; adopting measures to recruit, retain and promote members from diverse and vulnerable groups; and monitoring impact of gender equality initiatives,"" he said.He said panel on reducing arrears of cases had devised an action plan for reducing pendency through case management. Stages of tackling pendency are - preparatory stage of forming district level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases, and reconstruction of records; resolve cases which have been pending for 10-20 years, 20-30 years and over 30 years.He said from Jan to June 2025, judiciary shall execute third phase of clearing the backlog of cases pending for over a decade in courts.",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate.
