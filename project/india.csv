NEW DELHI: With the worst of the air quality days linked to stubble burning yet to come in Delhi-NCR , the Centre on Saturday advised Punjab and Haryana to strategically plan and handle the situation by deploying all necessary resources in the hotspot districts where burning episodes may likely occur in coming days.The issue was discussed during an inter-ministerial meeting at Krishi Bhawan where officials apprehended the burning episodes may increase in the next fortnight coinciding with the pace of harvest operations in both Punjab and Haryana even as both the states have, so far, reported a lower number of such incidents compared to last year. The slow pace of harvest is linked to depressed procurement operations in Punjab where millers have been facing storage and paddy quality issues.Since firecrackers are also responsible for deteriorating air quality around Diwali every year, the participants also discussed how to deal with it by strictly adhering to the Supreme Court's order through proactive measures and creating public awareness.Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who attended the meeting virtually, said though the episodes of stubble burning had reduced by 35% in Punjab and 21% in Haryana compared to the corresponding period in 2023, there was a need to further decrease the number using multiple interventions for both in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw.He said it was the efforts of all stakeholders that brought down the stubble burning episodes by 51% compared to 2017, and appealed to states to promote bio-decomposer in mission mode.A detailed presentation on how the issue of stubble burning is being handled was made by agriculture secretary Devesh Chaturvedi during the meeting. The participants were informed that the Centre has, so far, this year released Rs 150 crore for paddy straw management to Punjab, Rs 75 crore to Haryana, Rs 50 crore to UP and over Rs 8 crore to 'Krishi Vigyan Kendras' out of total Rs 600 crore earmarked for this purpose during 2024-25.Besides Chouhan, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai, and agriculture ministers of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh also joined the meeting virtually. Haryana officials shared details of various incentives which are being provided to farmers in the state to deal with the problem through ex-situ/in-situ management of biomass and crop diversification.Punjab and Haryana have this year estimated generation of 19.5 million tonne and 8 million tonne of paddy straw respectively. Punjab is learnt to have promised to manage 11.5 million tonne of its paddy straw through in-situ crop residue management using crop residue management (CRM) machines and the rest via ex-situ methods.Similarly, Haryana has plans to manage 3.3 million tonne through in-situ and the remainder through ex-situ measures such as strengthening the supply chain of stubble as resources to small industries in briquetting and pelletizing operations to enhance the economic use of paddy straw.States have over the years supported farmers and custom hiring centres for procuring three lakh subsidised CRM machines under the crop residue management scheme of the agriculture ministry.",The Centre has advised Punjab and Haryana to strategically plan and handle the situation.

The FIR, filed on June 27, 2024, also included Section 500 of IPC, a non-cognizable offence that requires a direct complaint to a magistrate. “It was after arresting Sanap and producing him before the magistrate, the police realised that 66A and 66B were not applicable. They subsequently added 67A of the IT Act,” Dhawale said.The HC division bench, comprising Justice Vibha Kankanwadi and Justice SG Chapalgaonkar, observed that “this arrest is made at midnight, it is in total violation of the personal liberty enshrined under the Constitution of India”.Criticising Padalkar, the HC noted that “it is beyond imagination that before the arrest, the investigating officer will not apply his mind, as to which are the sections that are invoked”.It said, “The realisation of the wrong section, after the arrest of a person, would be a suicide attempt by an investigating officer, because he is bound to follow the law before and at the time of effecting arrest.”The bench further noted that even the magistrate failed to exercise due diligence when presented with Sanap for custody. Citing the SC’s decisions in Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar and Satender Kumar Antil vs CBI, the HC observed that both magistrates and investigating officers were bound to assess if an arrest was justified before granting custody.Highlighting issues of procedural negligence, the court said Sanap was held despite the fact that “Section 67-A of the IT Act was not at all attracted, taking into consideration the facts of the case”. The HC division bench noted that respondent Tare, Sanap’s former brother-in-law, lodged the FIR “with mala fide intention” because of a family dispute.Sanap, who had separated from Tare’s sister, allegedly sent a defamatory WhatsApp message to a relative. The court observed that because WhatsApp “is end-to-end encrypted, the sender cannot intend for a private message to be public, unless the recipient forwards it”.Addressing the implications for judicial integrity, the HC said, “We deprecate such kind of practice,” admonishing lower courts. It expressed concern over an observed trend of magistrates “passing mechanical orders.” The HC ordered that a copy of the judgment be sent to the superintendent of police, Hingoli, for review and potential action in accordance with SC guidelines in the case of Arnesh Kumar.","Ashwinkumar Sanap was arrested on Aug 6 under sections 66A and 66B of Information Technology (IT) Act.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.",The deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility.

Nearly two dozen hotels across Kolkata, Tirupati and Rajkot went into a tizzy on Saturday after emailed bomb threats that eventually turned out to be a hoax, deepening fears that the festival season menace so far aimed at flights and airports was spreading to other key sectors.In Kolkata, at least 10 major hotels — most of them star properties — received the emails on a day home minister Amit Shah was visiting Bengal. Although the usual anti-bomb drills were activated, nothing was found. “The emails followed the same pattern as hoax threats to schools earlier this year,” said a Kolkata cop.Kolkata police alerted central agencies given the multiple threats to flights over the past week. Top officers said the email sender used a pseudonym — Reality Is Fake. “I have planted bombs on the grounds of your hotel. The bombs are hidden in black bags. They will detonate soon. You have little time to live. Evacuate,” one email reportedly stated.In Tirupati, the threat was sent to three hotels Saturday, deepening a pattern as four properties in the Andhra city had been targeted in the past two days. All turned out to be hoaxes.The threat emails referred to Jaffer Sadiq, alleged kingpin of a major drug racket nabbed by central agencies in July. Saturday’s threats mentioned two other names — TN deputy CM Udayanidhi Stalin’s wife Kiruthiga and TN DGP Shankar Jiwal.The email mentioned “Afzal Guru will be re-born! Al-Badr!” — referring to the 2001 Parliament attack convict executed in 2013. The email also claimed Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu’s car was twinned with hotel “IEDs”.In Gujarat’s Rajkot, 10 hotels simultaneously received emails around 12.45pm Saturday from the same ID, “Kan Din”, threatening explosions. Rajkot DCP Parthrajsinh Gohil said the hotels were searched but nothing suspicious was found.","Nearly two dozen hotels across Kolkata, Tirupati and Rajkot went into a tizzy on Saturday.

MumbaiBombay high court has directed Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central to immediately discharge an 18-year-old woman and her newborn child after it refused to discharge them without the filing of a police complaint since she had conceived when she was a minor .Justices Burgess Colabawalla and Somasekhar Sundaresan Friday allowed a petition by the woman’s mother. “Considering an FIR has already been filed, we see no impediment in directing Nair Hospital in discharging the petitioner’s daughter, along with her child,” they stated.They passed the order noting the “rather peculiar” facts of the case. The daughter attained age of majority on Aug 18. She was in a “voluntary” relationship with her friend. They developed physical intimacy and she became pregnant. At that time, she was 17 years and a few months old.During a check-up at Nair Hospital, it was noticed that the girl was a minor when she conceived. The hospital forwarded her details to the police station as it was a Pocso case. She delivered on Oct 11.Since she desired to surrender her child for adoption, the hospital was not discharging her without a police complaint being filed. Hence, her mother moved HC to direct her discharge and to direct the Child Welfare Committee to proceed with the adoption process without insisting on an FIR.At the in-chambers hearing, the judges were informed by govt pleader Poornima Kantharia of the FIR against the daughter’s boyfriend. The mother’s advocates said it was filed based on her initial statement during her daughter’s admission to the hospital. The mother told the judges that as the relationship between her daughter and her boyfriend was consensual, they do not want to prosecute him.The judges disposed of the plea directing that “petitioner’s daughter and her child shall, along with the police, immediately produce themselves before the Child Welfare Committee… for surrendering the child for adoption.”",Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central refused to discharge 18-year-old woman and her newborn child without the filing of a police complaint since she had conceived when she was a minor.

'Elon Musk a great man': Isro chief Somanath praises SpaceX for catching Starship booster with 'chopsticks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elon-musk-a-great-man-isro-chief-somanath-praises-spacex-for-catching-starship-booster-with-chopsticks/articleshow/114618389.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) chief S. Somanath on Saturday praised Elon Musk and SpaceX for successfully catching a giant Starship booster with 'chopsticks', stating that Musk was ""a great man doing fantastic work"".Addressing the Convocation day of IIIT-Delhi, Somanath expressed admiration for Musk's transformative impact on the space industry.He noted that Musk's innovative approaches, particularly with SpaceX's recent rocket recovery methods, have sparked global interest and comparisons with Isro's capabilities. Somanath emphasised that while there is a competitive spirit to match Musk's achievements, the inspiration drawn from his work is significant for the future of India's space endeavors.""Musk is making heads turn with the type of rockets that he has captured with the chopsticks recently and people are asking when Isro is going to do this ... Everyone is looking at Musk, what he is doing there and how we can come up with some fantastic idea that we can beat him. Of course, everybody wants to beat him, but he is above all of that. I think he is such a great man doing fantastic work. We are all inspired by this work. It is because of this that the space is becoming very attractive today,"" said the Isro chief.On October 13, SpaceX made significant advancements in rocket recovery technology with its innovative ""chopsticks"" system, successfully demonstrated during the fifth test flight of its Starship. This technique represents a pivotal step towards achieving rapid reusability in spaceflight.It is expected to facilitate not only more frequent launches but also lower costs associated with space travel. Estimates suggest that Starship could eventually bring launch costs down to under $10 per kilogram, a dramatic reduction compared to previous systems like the Space Shuttle.Somanath highlighted the growing enthusiasm among young people for space exploration, attributing this trend to advancements in technology and increased accessibility. ""Young people are looking at space with great passion. We are looking at it in a manner in which the technology is becoming accessible to people ... The application domain is growing. Also, its impact on the economy, employability, and job creation is growing. These domains are very important and that's why the government has recently taken the initiative to open up the space sector, bringing in more private investment and private participation,"" he added.The recent reforms are pivotal in transforming India's space landscape. They allow for 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in various segments of the space industry, which is expected to significantly boost the Indian space economy from its current valuation of approximately $8 billion to an ambitious $100 billion by 2040. The establishment of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) has been crucial in this transition, providing a regulatory framework that enables private companies to engage more actively in space activities.Somanath pointed out that while certain aspects of space technology will remain regulated, there is a pressing need to democratize access to application domains.""It's a domain that cannot be kept controlled and regulated. Of course, there is some knowledge that needs to be controlled and regulated, but the application domains, doing work, creating value in this have to get out of those vaults that have been covering the space systems,"" said Somanath.Moreover, he acknowledged that ISRO continues to play a central role in India's space ambitions while encouraging private players to contribute significantly.

Abujmarh’s oldest Maoist with Rs 16 lakh bounty gunned down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abujmarhs-oldest-maoist-with-rs-16-lakh-bounty-gunned-down/articleshow/114637943.cms,"NAGPUR: The most dreaded guerrilla of Dandakaranya forests, Ankalu Dasru Tulavi alias Saoji Tulavi, who had 226 cases against him — the highest in Maharashtra’s criminal history — was neutralised during the dramatic siege of the Maoist headquarters of Abujmarh on Oct 21.The body of the 65-year-old, who carried a bounty of Rs 16 lakh after killing 54 cops and informers and engineering 84 gunbattles with commandos, was identified by surrendered guerrillas after the corpse was flown to Gadchiroli from the encounter site.A key member of the Maoist supply team, Tulavi provided logistics support to People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army ( PLGA ) fighters and other top cadres operating from the once-fortified, booby-trapped Abujmarh hills. He was shot along with another male cadre and three women guerrillas.Tulavi was, perhaps, one of the oldest Maoists, who remained loyal and deeply entrenched in the rebel movement for 33 years, refusing to surrender in face of depleting ranks or state allurements despite his advancing years. He joined the Tippagarh Dalam as a party member in 1991 and rose through the ranks to become a divisional committee member.Tulavi’s criminal case tally overshadowed those of other top Maoists. These included Joganna, who was shot dead in May 2024 and had 195 cases. Slain guerrilla Diwakar Kurchami had 190 cases. Surrendered Maoists Giridhar Tumaretti and Vilas Kolha were booked for 179 and 191 offences, respectively.“A Gadchiroli tribal, Tulavi was an experienced PLGA fighter who knew the region and the terrain like the back of his hand. He also knew routes and strategic locations, which made him pivotal to the rebel army,” said a security agency official. Tulavi, who was moved to the difficult and challenging terrain of Abujmarh, had spurned multiple offers to surrender even as his junior cadres gave up the gun, got married and settled down with police help.While Tulavi cheated death many times, particularly during the 2021 Mardintola encounter in which Maoist central committee member Milind Teltumbde was neutralised, he was unlucky this time. The joint team of C-60 commandos and CRPF teams had surrounded the Koparshi forests in Abujmarh, leaving little room for guerrillas to wriggle out of cordon.The Oct 21 encounter was spearheaded by SP Neelotpal, Addl SPs Yatish Deshmukh and M Ramesh, DIG, Naxal Range, Ankit Goyal, and IG, State Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) chief Sandip Patil.",The body of Ankalu Dasru Tulavi alias Saoji Tulavi was identified by surrendered guerrillas after the corpse was flown to Gadchiroli from the encounter site.

""The latest step (of disengagement) was the October 21 understanding that patrolling will take place in Depsang and Demchok. This will allow us now to look at the next step. It is not like everything has been resolved but the disengagement which is the first phase we have managed to reach that level,"" Jaishankar said at an event in Pune.Responding to a question during a separate interaction with students, Jaishankar said it is still a bit early for normalisation of relations which will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and willingness to work together.He said when PM Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia for Bricsthe BRICS summit, it was decided that the foreign ministers and National Security Advisors of the two countries would meet and see how to move forward.""If today we have reached where we have...One is because of the very determined effort on our part to stand our ground and make our point. The military was there (at LAC) in very very unimaginable conditions to defend the country, and the military did its part and diplomacy did its part,"" Jaishankar said. Over the decade, India improved its infrastructure, he said, adding that part of the problem is that in the earlier years, the border infrastructure was really neglected.""Today we have put in five times more resources annually than there used to be a decade ago which is showing results and enabling the military to actually be effectively deployed. The combination of these (factors) has led to where it is,"" he said.Earlier this week, India announced it had reached an agreement with China on patrolling along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a major breakthrough in ending the over four-year-long military standoff .Following the agreement, the two countries have begun troop disengagement at the two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh and this process is likely to be completed by October 28-29.","Jaishankar said it is still a bit early for normalisation of relations which will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and willingness to work together.

Such questions require reflection not only by medical professionals but also by the legal community,"" he said. Justice Gavai referenced 'The Second Machine Age', a book by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, which explores the ethical challenges posed by automation of traditional human skills.He highlighted that a significant challenge for the future of surgery will be ensuring equitable access to these technologies.

In a setback to Ajit-Pawar led NCP and a judgment that can have bearing on other PMLA cases, a special court in Mumbai on Friday rejected a plea of NCP heavyweight and Maharashtra cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal that money laundering case against him and other associates be dropped. The minister unsuccessfully argued that ACB FIR (scheduled offence), a prerequisite for a PMLA case , has been quashed.The probe against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and other associates was first initiated by ACB, Maharashtra on directions of Bombay HC. After an initial inquiry, ACB registered an FIR in June 2015. This was the basis for ED to register an investigation under PMLA.However, ACB later dropped charges against accused Bhujbals. Encouraged by their acquittal by ACB, the accused moved special court seeking PMLA case against them to be dropped, too, since it requires existence of a scheduled offence. The PMLA special court, however, rejected their contention, distinguishing between schedule offence and the one under PMLA while observing that “facts emerging therefrom, even on taking them at their face value, disclose the existence of ingredients constituting the alleged offence”.ED had completed its probe and filed a chargesheet back in 2016. The special court took cognisance of the chargesheet, prima facie validating the ED findings and allowing charges to be framed against the accused.The probe linked ‘proceeds of crime’ of Rs 280 crore, received by one of the alleged associates of Bhujbal, as kickbacks generated in lieu of the works awarded without tender for construction of Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi and RTO office in Andheri. Bhujbal was then PWD minister in Maharashtra govt and responsible for award of the work. ED during its investigation had arrested Bhujbal and others and attached assets of the accused worth Rs 433 crore.","The probe against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and other associates was first initiated by ACB, Maharashtra on directions of Bombay HC.
