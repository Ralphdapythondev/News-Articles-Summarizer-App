'Closest ally': Maldivian President Muizzu thanks India for economic support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-president-thanks-india-china-for-help-to-boost-economy/articleshow/112089601.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed gratitude towards India for its support in easing debt repayment obligations and voiced optimism and stronger bilateral ties, possibly through a future free trade agreement.President Muizzu made these remarks during the official Independence Day function in the Maldives, celebrating eight months of 'diplomatic success,' as reported by the Maldives President Office.President Muizzu thanked India and China for their assistance in easing the Maldives' debt burden, which he said has allowed the country to maintain its economic sovereignty. He highlighted the ongoing negotiations for currency swap agreements with both New Delhi and Beijing as part of efforts to address local shortages of US dollars.""The Maldives government is negotiating currency swap agreements with both New Delhi and Beijing,"" said President Muizzu.Muizzu also disclosed that the Maldives is in the process of negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom and expressed hope to establish a similar agreement with India. This comes after a period of strained relations between the Maldives and India, which led to a diplomatic row.The Maldivian President recently attended the oath ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took office for a third consecutive term. Earlier this year, Muizzu sought measures for debt relief on substantial loans accumulated over consecutive governments and said that India would remain the Maldives' ""closest ally.""""India will continue to remain the Maldives' closest ally...there was no question about it,"" Muizzu said.According to Maldives-based publication The Edition, by the end of last year, the Maldives owed India 6.2 billion Maldivian Rufiyaa. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this year cautioned that the Maldives risks significant debt distress without substantial policy adjustments.Despite expressing gratitude now, President Mohamed Muizzu earlier displayed anti-India rhetoric and ran an electoral campaign under the slogan 'India Out.' His party’s main campaign promise focused on the removal of Indian troops from the Maldives. After assuming office, Muizzu has taken several actions that diverge from traditional India-Maldives relations.In a marked departure from established convention, Muizzu chose not to visit India during his first official trip abroad, opting instead for Turkey, followed by China. These visits resulted in the elevation of Maldives-China ties to a 'comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership' and the signing of about 20 agreements.Last December, the Maldives government announced it would not renew a Hydrographic Survey agreement with India. Subsequently, after Muizzu's government formally requested the withdrawal of Indian troops, New Delhi formed a High-Level Core Group to discuss the matter, completing the troop withdrawal by May this year.After the withdrawal, Maldives defence minister Ghassan Maumoon asserted that the country's defense forces were fully capable of operating three aircraft donated by India.""The country's defence forces were capable of operating the three aircraft donated by India,"" defence minister Ghassan Maumoon affirmed.Relations between New Delhi and Male soured further after three Maldivian deputy ministers made derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referencing his photographs taken during a visit to Lakshadweep. PM Modi had suggested developing the Indian island cluster as a beach tourism destination to boost domestic tourism.This incident escalated into a diplomatic dispute, leading New Delhi to summon the Maldivian envoy and lodge a strong protest. Consequently, the three deputy ministers were suspended and remain so with pay.Maldives tourism ministry data indicated a 33 percent drop in the number of Indian tourists visiting the Maldives earlier this year compared to the previous year. This decline underscores the impact of diplomatic tensions on the tourism sector.","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed gratitude towards India for its support in easing debt repayment obligations.

High court summons Surat MP over pleas against his unopposed win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-summons-surat-mp-over-pleas-against-his-unopposed-win/articleshow/112092034.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has issued summons to Bharatiya Janata Party MP from the Surat Lok Sabha constituency, Mukesh Dalal , over two petitions challenging his uncontested victory.The court of Justice JC Doshi issued summons to Dalal, directing him to respond by Aug 9, after the matter came up for hearing on July 25, the lawyer for petitioners PS Champaneri said on Sunday.Dalal was declared the winner on April 22, the last date for withdrawal of nomination, after Congress pick Nilesh Kumbhani 's nomination was rejected and other candidates withdrew from the race.The remaining 25 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat went to polls on May 7 in the third phase of general elections. Including Surat, BJP won 25 seats in the state, with Congress bagging one.The petitioners have challenged the legality and validity of the decision of the Surat collector and returning officer to reject Kumbhani's nomination. The two petitions, filed by four voters from the Surat parliamentary constituency who are also Congress members, question the decision of the returning officer to reject Kumbhani's form under the provisions of Section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, concerning scrutiny of the nomination forms.The petitioners have claimed that Kumbhani's three proposers who later denied having signed his nomination papers had declared in an application before the deputy collector that they would be signing as proposers on his nomination form.They had done so while applying for the certificate declaring them voters of the same constituency, a pre-condition for proposers.Furthermore, the verification of signatures is not a collector's job, they contended, stressing that the Congress, being a national party, doesn't have any shortage of proposers for its candidates in a given constituency. Dalal became the first candidate in the last 12 years to win a Lok Sabha contest unopposed.","Mukesh Dalal was declared the winner on April 22, the last date for withdrawal of nomination.

"Ensure saturation coverage of welfare schemes, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ensure-saturation-coverage-of-welfare-schemes-says-pm-modi/articleshow/112091350.cms,"NEW DELHI: On a day PM Modi exhorted states to be partners in India's journey towards being a developed country by 2047, home minister Amit Shah cautioned CMs of BJP-governed states that there was a strong possibility of the ""ecosystem which has been active against BJP"" trying to create unrest and communal violence, besides inciting farmers in states governed by the party.He said state governments should be vigilant about such elements. The statement assumes significance in view of the anti-CAA and farmers' protests in the past.Addressing the conclave of CMs & dy CMs of BJP-led states, Modi said a renewed focus on people's welfare by the Centre and states would ensure the goal of ' Viksit Bharat ' is achieved.

'Tiger's future hinges on us. It's a collective responsibility': Sachin Tendulkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigers-future-hinges-on-us-its-a-collective-responsibility-sachin-tendulkar/articleshow/112090775.cms,"In Tadoba, I had the opportunity to see three generations of tigers: Junabai, her cub Veera, and Veera's cubs. It is a wonderful feeling of pride and joy to see these majestic creatures thriving in the wild. This quiet yet powerful resurgence is a testament to India's years-old, science-based Project Tiger , which has borne remarkable results. It is a beautiful example of what the resilience of nature , powered by human intent, can achieve.India has seen around a 24% increase in its tiger population from 2018 to 2022 and is now home to 3,682 tigers. With this, India now hosts 75% of the world's tiger population.These numbers are impressive, and we owe this success to several prudent measures, including improved wildlife management , healthier prey bases, and more effective anti-poaching measures .Also, the immense contribution of the foot soldiers of the forest department who work so selflessly and devotedly under the most perilous and arduous conditions, away from family and social life, cannot be overlooked. States like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have led the way, with significant increases in their tiger populations.What has always been imperative in tiger conservation is reducing human-wildlife conflicts. Over the past few years, measures such as the incentivised relocation of villagers from core areas have greatly reduced these conflicts. While these numbers are encouraging, we cannot let our guard down just yet.The central Indian landscape, a crucial tiger habitat, faces numerous ecological and social challenges. This region spans across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Forests here not only support wildlife and indigenous populations but also hold valuable coal and mineral deposits. Development projects, including mining, road and railway construction, and reservoir building threaten the already fragmented landscape. If these development projects continue without appropriate measures, the central Indian Landscape could experience a significant decline in genetic diversity, estimated to be as high as 50%.The Central India Tiger Corridor Project has shown some encouraging results. This critical corridor covers around 152,000 square km across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh, and supports about 37% of India’s tiger population. The region includes 14 protected areas. Expanding these corridors and addressing bottlenecks through groundtruthing surveys and management plans can help preserve genetic diversity and promote healthy tiger populations.Effective tiger conservation cannot occur without the support of local communities. We should continue our pursuit to empower communities to manage conflicts and participate in conservation efforts. This will be key to achieving sustainable coexistence between humans and tigers.While poaching has declined, it remains a threat. The forest departments need to continue building their technical capacity. Sustained work towards deploying modern surveillance technologies and enforcing stricter laws against wildlife crimes might help keep poachers at bay.Strong, science-based policies and effective governance are central to successful conservation, but we must continue to build on them. The tiger population depends on continued support from govt bodies, clear policy frameworks, and collaborative efforts between national and international conservation organisations.Tigers have long been revered in Indian culture. A pastoralist tribe in Maharashtra, known as the Dhangar, venerates tigers as “Waghdev” or “Waghjai”, believing they protect their sheep. Waghoba, a primeval tiger, is considered the protector of the forest and has been worshipped by several tribal communities across India for ages. It is time we learn from these tribes and respect and protect these fierce creatures as our own family.The future of India’s tigers hinges on our ability to maintain and enhance habitat connectivity, promote sustainable development, and encourage a harmonious coexistence between wildlife and human communities. This is a collective responsibility. Tigers are our pride. Let their glory never fade!

IVR Scam: Tech-savvy fraudsters use IVR to empty citizens’ accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tech-savvy-fraudsters-use-ivr-to-empty-citizens-accounts/articleshow/112072047.cms,"AHMEDABAD: It was the shock of her life when a 65-year-old woman from Gandhinagar lost almost all of her lifetime savings of Rs 60 lakh to cybercrooks. Why? She followed instructions given to her by the automated interactive voice response (IVR) to download a ‘legal notice’ issued in her name.“The elderly woman got a call that she had got a legal notice and to know more, she should press 2 on her keypad.As soon as she clicked the digit, multiple transactions took place, emptying her bank account linked to the phone number . The woman said that she had not clicked any web links,” said a senior cyber cell official.It is the new trick of the cyber fraud trade which is used to bamboozle unsuspecting citizens by fraudsters . Identified as IVR scam , citizens get calls on pretext of law enforcement agencies, telecom companies, govt departments, courier companies or even electricity providers where the automated voice instructs the person to dial specific digits to navigate the menu.“The pressing of specific buttons activates a link that gives remote access to fraudsters. Often, the bank accounts are linked to phone numbers and users also have apps for banking. Gaining access to the same, fraudsters then transfer money to different accounts. Before a victim can realize, the money is transferred further, leaving no trace behind,” said an investigator. “While OTPs are generated for transaction verification, when the phone is under control of fraudsters, verifying it is not difficult.”Like sextortion, experts believe the IVR frauds are also automated, working independently of human intervention. The advanced AI tools are used with scripts for sectors such as banking, insurance and telecom services among others.“One of the reasons why the IVR frauds are proliferating nowadays is, it sounds more ‘genuine’ and authentic compared to someone pretending to be a representative of a firm. We request people not to take such calls, and not to press any buttons if they are not sure of the nature of the call. In some cases, the call is connected to a person posing as an official who asks the victims to download an app for remote access,” said a cyber cell official.The officials said the most common complaint from victims is that they have not shared any personal information or clicked any links. “But the advanced frauds bypass the conventional steps to gain access to the device. Prevention, as it is said often, is always better than cure. Avoid taking calls from unknown numbers and never download any links or divulge personal information on calls,” said the official.",A 65-year-old woman from Gandhinagar lost almost all of her lifetime savings of Rs 60 lakh to cybercrooks.

‘Local support’ for terrorists under scrutiny in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/local-support-for-terrorists-under-scrutiny-in-jammu/articleshow/112089060.cms,"J&K Attacks: PM Modi Orders Big Action Against Terrorists After High-Level Meeting | Reasi | Jammu

JAMMU: They were awakened by knocks at their doors. Policemen armed with automatic rifles surrounded their homes, bundled them into vehicles, and sped away through the forest tracks in their villages, which are about 25km apart and 110km southeast of Jammu city.These arrests added weight to suspicions of local support in the resurgence of terrorist activities in the Jammu zone of J&K, raising questions about the region’s security dynamics and the broader socio-political underpinnings.Police released a stripped-down statement. “Through meticulous investigation, two over ground workers (OGWs) have been identified and arrested for supporting terrorism-related activities. They are Layaqat Ali, alias Pawu, son of Gammi, from Ward No. 07, Kalna Dhanu Parole, Billawar, Kathua, and Mool Raj, alias Jenju, son of Uttam Chand, from Bowli Mohalla, Malhar, also in Kathua district.”Ali and Raj are residents of sleepy hamlets deep in the Pir Panjal range that slices through J&K — Jammu to the south and Kashmir valley to the north. Residents live miles apart. Cell and internet service is inconsistent — or non-existent. Here, nightly knocks could either mean terrorist, police, or a cousin who lost his cow in the woods.The two men’s villages are within range of Badnota, where an ambush on a two-truck patrol claimed the lives of five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles on July 8. From vantage points, the terrorists fired bullets downrange when the trucks were slowly negotiating a bend on Machedi-Kindli-Malhar road.The area falls under the Machedi forest belt — a remote and rugged landscape dotted with deep gorges, thick foliage, and mountain caves, providing ample cover for terrorists operating in small groups. In this treacherous terrain,security forces have struggled to neutralise the threat effectively, despite extensive seek-and-kill operations involving drones, helicopters, and military dogs.The situation raises critical questions. How do terrorists, presumed to be from Pakistan, manage to launch lethal attacks and evade capture in this challenging landscape? Do they have a local support system in place, or are they using coercion — gunpoint intimidation — and financial incentives to gain the support of impoverished villagers?Authorities have long claimed that local support is crucial for these Pakistani terrorists , who lack familiarity with the lay of the land. “Foreign terrorists, unfamiliar with the topography and security layout, cannot operate effectively without local guidance,” said a retired Army officer. “They can’t move a step outside of their hideout. But they struck at specific places of their choice (in recent attacks), which is not possible without local support and guidance.”According to security sources, more than 60 foreign terrorists, trained in jungle warfare, are active in small groups within the Jammu region. These groups are equipped with advanced technology, including iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery, and use high-end weapons like the American M4 carbine.Their capacity to coordinate attacks poses a significant challenge for security forces, evidenced by the successful ambushes and subsequent escapes, using dense foliage and darkness to their advantage. Recent attacks, such as the July 8 ambush on a military patrol, demonstrate the terrorists’ ability to strike specific targets with precision, indicating strong local knowledge.Ali and Raj were arrested for allegedly aiding the terrorists in hiding and navigating the area undetected. Earlier, police had arrested four men, including Showket Ali, who allegedly provided food, shelter, and WiFi access to three terrorists before the July 15 attack in Desa forest of Doda district, which left four soldiers dead.“Foreign terrorists might be luring locals with huge sums of money to work for them as OGWs,” said the retired Army officer. “They offer them a sense of comfort and safety in exchange for logistical support and intelligence.”On June 19, police arrested a 45-year-old man named Hakam Din, alleged to be an OGW and prime suspect in guiding and sheltering the group of suspected Pakistani gunmen who attacked a bus carrying pilgrims in Reasi district on June 9, resulting in the deaths of nine people. Din allegedly received Rs 6,000 for his assistance, which police claimed to have found in his possession.The timing of the attacks, often occurring in isolated areas and at night, further suggested a dependence on local support. “Without using GPS or other navigation aids to avoid detection, these terrorists need locals to guide them,” a security source said. Recent terrorist strikes, including the Bhangri shootout and the Chatergalla mountain pass attack, highlighted the dependency of terrorists on local operatives .In 2023, security agencies arrested 291 people associated with terrorist groups, emphasising the widespread threat of local support. J&K DGP RR Swain reported the dismantling of 89 terrorist modules, with 78 in Kashmir and 11 in Jammu. Despite these efforts, the surge in attacks this summer has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current security measures.Authorities have warned people against aiding terrorists, while also urging locals to report any “suspicious movement” in their area. Locals denied any involvement with terrorists. One villager, who preferred to remain anonymous, offered a perspective on their predicament soon after the Reasi pilgrim bus attack: “What do you do when a jihadi points an AK-47 at your head and demands food? Yield or fight back? Inform police and risk retaliation?”The escalation in terrorism-related violence has concerned locals in upper reaches, who demanded the strengthening of village defence groups (VDGs) to tackle threats. In places like Kralaan village of Doda, VDGs are assisting security forces in the counteroffensive.The key to intelligence gathering is surveillance, stakeouts, and stealth — essential for telling the bad guys from the good. However, the recent string of attacks and fatalities have raised concerns about intelligence failures.Historically, the nomadic Gujjar-Bakerwal community has been a vital intelligence source for security agencies. However, recent events have strained this relationship. The granting of scheduled tribe status to the Paharis and the deaths of three community members in Army custody last winter have caused a sense of betrayal among some Bakerwal members.Nevertheless, community leaders reaffirm their patriotism. “Our community has always supported the Army,” said Adil Khan, a Bakerwal. “We reciprocate the Army’s assistance with our cooperation.”Advocate Anwer Choudhary echoed this sentiment, stressing that the community remains focused on their safety and well-being rather than reservation issues.The attacks are particularly concerning, with the Supreme Court setting a deadline of Sept 30 for the upcoming assembly elections in J&K. Is the surge in terrorist activities a deliberate attempt to derail the democratic process? Official sources said the attacks are designed to project a sense of dominance by the terrorists despite the enhanced security grid in the region.","Layaqat Ali, alias Pawu, from Ward No. 07, Kalna Dhanu Parole, Billawar, Kathua, and Mool Raj, alias Jenju, son of Uttam Chand, from Bowli Mohalla, Malhar, also in Kathua district.

NEW DELHI: Election strategist-turned politician Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Abhiyan will be forming a political party on October 2 , which will also coincide with the 155th birth anniversary of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.Mainly active in Bihar , Prashant Kishor has been planning to hold eight separate state-level meetings of more than 1.5 lakh officials linked to the campaign.In these meetings, the process of formation of the party, its leadership, constitution and priorities of the party will be decided with all the officials, Prashant Kishor's organisation announced on in a press brief.A few days ago, Prashant Kishor claimed that around one crore people would join Jan Suraaj when it becomes a full-fledged party.Kishor first made this announcement during a meeting with Jan Suraaj Campaign Committee members, urging them to unite Bihar, which he said is divided by castes.Kishor said his initiative has started yielding results and called on members to educate the masses if they want to change the system.Kishor also announced plans to contest all 243 assembly seats in Bihar to transform the state's political landscape.""We have come with the mission to change the face of Bihar and not to win 20-25 seats. Just have patience for two years,"" he said.Kishor said among the three major parties in the state, the RJD is the most nervous. ""Just listen to me…(You will see that lantern will be left with no kerosene to be lit)"", he said, adding once minority communities join the Jan Suraaj campaign, the lantern would be extinguished.In 2022, a whopping 97.26% of Jan Suraaj members in West Champaran district cast their ballot with 'yes', giving Prashant Kishor the thumbs up to form a political party in Bihar.The democratic exercise was undertaken at the district convention marking the culmination of the West Champaran leg of Kishor's ""padyatra"" on the MJK College grounds.","Election strategist-turned politician Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Abhiyan will be forming a political party on October 2.

A legal notice was served to the shop licensee by the excise officials.The shop owner refuted any wrongdoing, asserting that the banner was placed on another person's private property, suggesting a potential conspiracy against him by an unknown party. However, the police were unconvinced by his explanations and found them unsatisfactory.

But this special privilege and woman-protecting laws should not be made a sword to settle scores or to satisfy ulterior motives, which is going rampant in the society,"" the court said.The court acknowledged the seriousness and traumatic nature of rape but also recognized that the law against rape is being misused in some instances. It highlighted that filing a criminal complaint should not be used as a means to achieve ulterior motives or to teach the accused a lesson.The court instructed the Delhi police to take appropriate legal action against the complainant for making a false complaint out of anger and while intoxicated, which led to the man's imprisonment for approximately 10 days.It also advised the police to exercise caution when arresting accused persons in cases where circumstances warrant initial inquiry or investigation, as no compensation can adequately indemnify an innocent person for incarceration based on a false complaint.","Delhi court directs police to initiate legal proceedings against a woman for filing a false rape case.

"Ahead of Quad, EAM meets Blinken who seeks just peace for Ukraine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-eam-jaishankar-antony-blinken-hold-talks-before-quad-meet/articleshow/112089582.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the tensions in ties over India’s relationship with Russia, foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US counterpart Antony Blinken met Sunday with the former saying that the India-US bilateral agenda is progressing steadily and that they also had discussions on regional and global issues.In the meeting, according to a US readout, Blinken underscored the importance of realizing a “just and enduring” peace for Ukraine consistent with the UN Charter.The meeting took place in the middle of strife in relations over PM Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Russia and India’s continued diplomatic tightrope walk on the war in Ukraine that may see him visiting Ukraine next month.Blinken also said in his own remarks on X they met to deepen collaboration and affirm the shared commitment to regional peace , security, and prosperity.The leaders met in Tokyo ahead of the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday where India, US, Australia and Japan will reaffirm commitment to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific in the face of increasing Chinese assertiveness in South China Sea. While the Quad summit which India was hoping to host in January has been inordinately delayed, the ministers are expected to explore the possibility of having the same on the margins of the UNGA in September.According to government sources, PM Narendra Modi won’t mind having the summit in New York and while the US and Australia are also keen, there’s still doubt about whether Japanese PM Fumio Kishida will be able to make it as the UNGA 2024 clashes with the presidential election for Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The election as of now is expected to take place either on September 20 or 27.Amid renewed China-Philippines tensions, theQuad meeting on Monday will likely see a reiteration of the 4 democracies’ joint vision of keeping the Indo-Pacific stable and secure, free from intimidation and coercion, and where sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. The Russia-Ukraine war is also expected to figure in the meeting with the ministers likely to focus on its humanitarian consequences.Despite India’s initial reluctance to include the war in Quad’s agenda, concerns over the global food security situation have seen the grouping focus on the implications of Russia’s actions in Ukraine in a big way. Apart from the US, Japan and Australia are also likely to appreciate Modi’s decision to visit Ukraine next month. The last foreign ministers’ meeting on the margins of the UNGA in 2023 saw the participants mourning in a joint statement the “terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences” of the war in Ukraine and underscoring the need for a “comprehensive, just, and lasting peace” in accordance with international law, consistent with the principles of the UN Charter. In the context of the Ukraine war, Quad has also described the threat of use of nuclear weapons as unacceptable.The ministers will also review cooperation on Quad initiatives for the Indo-Pacific announced during the 2023 Hiroshima summit last year, including in climate change, clean energy supply chains, and infrastructure.","The leaders met in Tokyo ahead of the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday.

The deceased were identified as Shreya Yadav (25) of UP, Tanya Soni (25) from Telangana and Nevin Delvin (24) from Kerala.According to officials, the coaching institute had been granted permission to utilise the basement as a storeroom; however, it was being used as a library, which was in breach of the regulations.The Mayor of Delhi, Shelly Oberoi, instructed the MCD commissioner to take stringent measures against institutes that are utilizing basements for commercial purposes, which is a violation of building byelaws.Delhi police registered an FIR and formed multiple teams to probe the Rajinder Nagar coaching centre flooding incident where civil service aspirants lost their lives.“Multiple teams have been formed to probe the entire incident. We have asked the Delhi Fire Services to provide us with a report about the building and the basement which was being used as a library but mentioned as ‘store room’,” a senior police officer said.The basement, situated eight feet below ground level, was occupied by more than 18 students on Saturday evening when heavy rains caused flooding. The basement gate was closed, but the high pressure of the rainwater damaged it, allowing water to rush in. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to determine the sequence of events.The FIR, based on the statement of SI Dharmender Kumar Sharma, revealed that the owner of the centere who was present during the incident, was unable to provide the necessary documents for running a library in the basement.

"22,920 candidates score full marks across 45 subjects in CUET-UG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/22920-candidates-score-full-marks-across-45-subjects-in-cuet-ug/articleshow/112089968.cms,"Highest full-marks scorers in Business Studies, Political Science next

NEW DELHI: Registering a marginal increase in top scorers, 22,920 candidates scored full marks across 45 subjects in the Common University Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( CUET-UG 2024), the gateway to undergraduate courses across 283 universities in India.However, this year, as earlier announced by National Testing Agency, these top scorers scored perfect 200, while in 2022 and 2023 the agency accorded percentile scores as the papers were conducted in multiple sessions and normalisation method was employed.Bringing relief to lakhs of aspirants, NTA announced the results on Sunday evening. Of the 63 subjects, 200 is the maximum marks for 62 and the General Test paper is of 250 marks.The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520).In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200. Of the 8.2 lakh candidates who took the English test, 1,683 scored 200.Sanskrit and Punjabi were the other two languages where over 50 candidates had perfect scores. A total of 22,836 aspirants scored 100 percentile in 2023 and 21,159 scored 100 percentile in 2022.Though the number of perfect scorers increased marginally from the number of 100 percentile scorers in 2023, the competition for select programmes like commerce is set to get tougher in popular universities like Delhi University (DU). The number of aspirants scoring 100 percentile in Busi- ness Studies was 2,357 in 2023, which has increased to 8,024 this year. However, for sought after honour programmes like economics/business econom- ics, there is likely to be a de- crease in minimum eligible marks as the number of high scorers have come down by 454% from last year. Among the 8,000-plus perfect scorers in Business Studies is Khusali Nahataa from Delhi, who aspires for admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce or Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.A student of Modern School, Barakhambha Road, she said, “I chose to study BS with a lot of mind maps and charts. I’m aiming for SRCC or LSR. I did not take any coaching and did 8-10 hours of self-study every day.” Anjali Jyoti, a student of DAV Noida, Sector 56, scored 200/200 in three (Geography, Political Science and Psychol- ogy) of the five subjects she appeared. she said, “I want to pursue BA (Political Science H) from one of the best colleg- es of DU. I relied entirely on self-study as maximum syl- labus was from Class 12 so there was no need for extra sources or coaching. Only the deleted portion needed to be covered separately.”On July 7, NTA had released provisional answer keys of CUET-UG 2024. A retest for over 1,000 candidates whose grievances were found genuine by the agency was conducted on July 19. The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including in NEET-UG and UGC-NET.Originally, CUET results were scheduled to be released on June 30 but NTA delayed it, grappling with paper leak allegations involving NEETUG, UGC-NET and CSIRUGC-NET. CUET-UG, conducted in hybrid mode for the first time across the country, was cancelled in Delhi a night before the scheduled exam over “logistical reasons”. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.NTA had earlier an- nounced that the third edition of CUET-UG would be com- pleted in seven days and there would be no normalisation of scores as all exams would be conducted in a single shift.For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48, the exam was held in CBT mode. Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during announcement of results.","The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520) In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200.

We are looking at an investment of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore for creating trunk infrastructure and will then offer plots to companies,"" Singh said, adding that the model is the same as was followed in earlier cases. While Dholera (Gujarat), Vikram Udyogpuri (MP), Shendra Bidkin (Maharashtra) and Dadri had been taken up in the first phase when the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor was conceived 15 years ago, similar nodes are coming up in Krishnapatnam (Andhra), Tumakuru (Karnataka), Nangal Chaudhary (Haryana) and Greater Noida (UP).Typically, these projects take 10-15 years to be fully developed, including allotment of land, but Singh said that in several new cases, things will move quickly as they are already around large cities.But from the initial phase when Dholera and Shendra Bidkin were sought to be developed as completely new cities, the newer projects are seen to be on a smaller scale, focusing on creating logistics hubs or industrial clusters.Some of the newer projects will be along the Amritsar-Kolkata industrial corridor, which is running woefully behind schedule given that land was not acquired by the West Bengal government.Singh also said that government intends to correct the inverted duty structure for sectors such as leather and textiles and his department will take up the issue with the revenue department, which handles the import duty. Inverted duty refers to the duty structure where finished products attract lower duty than inputs and raw material, creating complications for manufacturers.In the budget, Sitharaman has made an attempt to revise some of the tariffs with inputs sought for further changes. Singh said industry consultations on the issue will be held soon.He also said that the abolition of angel tax will boost the startup ecosystem, by helping with funding, and also support foreign direct investment flows into the country. Department for industrial promotion and internal trade is also undertaking a review of the FDI norms and procedures, and Singh said the idea is to ensure that the approvals, wherever required, come quickly.","Gaya, Koparthy and Orvakal may have hogged the limelight due to the focus on packages for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in the Union budget.

""Over the past 24 years, I've been seeing every day a constant battle over how fundamental freedoms and fundamental constitutional values such as equality are being chipped away , not brick by brick, but by infinitely small proportions every time you face injustice,"" he said.Delivering the keynote address at ""Is There Hope For Equality Law?"" event, organised by National Law School of India University at Bangalore International Centre, the CJI reflected on men manually cleaning drains in Delhi.The CJI questioned the true freedom of these people. ""Freedom from having to manually clean waste has a deep and historical context rooted in caste in our society. In this case, freedom is inextricably rooted in the concept of equality. An unequal society implies an unfree society because the lower unequals are always unfree from the higher unequals,"" he said.Despite the widespread support for equality and anti-discrimination laws, he questioned why prejudice and discrimination still persist. Citing Nobel laureate Amartya Sen's work on intersecting identities, the CJI underscored the importance of recognising multiple social categories such as class, caste, gender, ability, sexuality and religion, which intersect to produce unique experiences of discrimination and marginalisation.""By considering inequality through a single-axis lens, we risk overlooking the complex experiences of individuals with multiple marginalised identities and inadvertently prioritise the voices of the more privileged within marginalised groups,"" Justice Chandrachud said.

However, Rani Punjabi 's claims were denied by Zufar Farooqui, who is the head of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust which has been formed for the construction of the mosque, saying her claims were already rejected by the Allahabad High Court in 2021.Farooqui, who is also the chairperson of the Sunni Central Waqf Board , said work on the entire project, including the construction of the mosque, will start from October this year.Rani Punjabi, a resident of Delhi, claims that the five acres of land given by the administration to the Sunni Central Waqf Board in Dhannipur village of Ayodhya after the 2019 order of the Supreme Court is a part of 28.35 acres of land owned by her family.Rani told PTI they have all the documents of ownership and she will approach the Supreme Court to get it.According to Rani, her father Gyan Chand Punjabi had to leave the Punajb on Pakistan side after Partition, and he moved to Faizabad (now Ayodhya district) where he was allotted the 28.35 acre of lans in lieu of the land he had to leave behind.She said her family used the land for farming until 1983, when her father's health deteriorated and the family settled in Delhi for his treatment.Since then, the land was progressively encroached upon, she claimed.Rani says she has no objection to the construction of the mosque but she wants the administration to do justice to her.It is not permissible to build a mosque on any disputed land in Islam.However, Farooqui said, ""There is no obstacle in the project. As far as the woman's claim on the land is concerned, the Allahabad High Court has already rejected it in 2021. There are some minor issues which are being resolved and it is expected that work on the project will start by October.""Asked about the board's previous statement that the construction of the mosque and other buildings would start from May this year, Farooqui said, ""Yes, there has been some delay because the design of the entire project is being prepared afresh.""Also, the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) certificate for raising funds has also not been received yet, he said.A senior official of the project construction committee said on the condition of anonymity that he has met Rani Punjabi several times over her claim and told her that in Islam it is not permissible to build a mosque on a disputed land. ""If she has solid evidence in support of her claim, she should present it, but she could not do so.""In a historic verdict delivered on November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court had ordered the construction of Ram Temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site, while giving five acres land to Muslims at a prominent place in Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque.On the orders of the government, the Sunni Central Waqf Board was allotted the land in Dhannipur village in Raunahi of Ayodhya district.The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust formed for the construction of the mosque has also announced to build a hospital, community kitchen, library and research institute along with the mosque on the given land.It was expected that the construction of the mosque would be completed along with that of the Ram Temple.The consecration ceremony of the Ram temple was done in January, but the construction of the mosque is yet to start.Those associated with the project attribute the delay to problems in getting the map approved, lack of funds and other issues.","Rani Punjabi claims that the land earmarked for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya after the Supreme Court order belongs to her family.

New technique to extract alcohol from agricultural waste promises less reliance on imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-technique-to-extract-alcohol-from-agricultural-waste-promises-less-reliance-on-imports/articleshow/112088375.cms,"RUDRAPUR: Scientists at Pantnagar University in Udham Singh Nagar district developed a technique to extract 90% alcohol from agricultural waste , reducing India's reliance on imported alcohol, mainly from China. This innovation, led by researcher Mohammad Aziz under the guidance of professors MGH Zaidi and Sameena Mehtab from College of Basic Sciences & Humanities, promises to revolutionise alcohol production in the country.Traditionally, in India, alcohol is produced mainly from sugarcane which yields only 6-8% alcohol, necessitating imports from China.The research into the new technique will be published in the Scientific Reports journal by Nature, and a patent is being filed. Mehtab and Aziz said India produced 230 crore tonnes of agricultural waste in 2021 and 750 tonnes in 2023. This biomass, containing 70-90% sugar polymers (cellulose), is suitable for bioethanol (alcohol) production.Despite abundant biomass, India produces only about 15% of its bioethanol consumption, using only edible sugar. China developed bioethanol-from-biomass technology long ago but has not shared it. Most countries rely on fermentation technology for bioethanol production . In traditional fermentation, cellulose is extracted from biomass, fermented with enzymes to produce sugar, vapourised, isolated, and fermented again to produce 6-8% alcohol. The new technology avoids using organic solvents, which would render the alcohol unusable.The new method involves isolating cellulose from sugarcane bagasse or other high-cellulose waste, incubating it to produce fermentable sugar, and then hydrolysing it with an enzyme in a solvent. This swells the biomass and allows the enzyme to penetrate deeply. Unlike the old method, which only converts the surface carbohydrates, this technique ensures a more thorough conversion.Prof Zaidi said, ""We developed a technology to produce alcohol from agricultural waste after nearly a decade of hard work. China produces and exports alcohol from agricultural waste at low prices, while in India, alcohol from sugarcane is nearly six times more expensive due to its low yield.""","Scientists at Pantnagar University in Udham Singh Nagar district developed a technique to extract 90% alcohol from agricultural waste.
