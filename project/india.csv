Projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that India is set to surpass Japan by 2025, making it the fourth-largest economy. Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth, as highlighted by the latest data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Released by the Labour Bureau on September 23, 2024, the PLFS for July 2023 to June 2024 reveals ongoing challenges in the Indian labour market.Despite five years of decline, the overall unemployment rate has stagnated at 3.2% for 2023-24.Alarmingly, the youth unemployment rate is at 10.2%, with males at 9.8% and females facing a higher rate of 11%. This trend is particularly concerning for women, whose unemployment rate has increased from 2.9% to 3.2% over the past year.Topping the list, Lakshadweep has the highest unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29, with an overall rate of 36.2%. Female unemployment in the union territory stands at a staggering 79.7%, compared to 26.2% for males.With an unemployment rate of 33.6%, this UT also has a significant gap between male (24%) and female (49.5%) unemployment.Despite having the highest literacy rate in India, Kerala faces an unemployment rate of 29.9%, with a particularly high female unemployment rate of 47.1%, compared to 19.3% for males.This northeastern state has an unemployment rate of 27.4%, with a more balanced distribution between males (27.9%) and females (26.6%).Manipur’s unemployment rate stands at 22.9%, with females facing higher unemployment (27.5%) compared to males (19.9%).The union territory of Ladakh has a total unemployment rate of 22.2%, with female unemployment reaching 38.3%, which is significantly higher than male unemployment at 11.4%.Arunachal Pradesh has an overall unemployment rate of 20.9%, with male unemployment at 21.9% and female unemployment at 19.6%. The relatively lower gap between male and female unemployment in this state shows a more balanced employment landscape. However, with a fifth of the youth population unemployed, the state still faces serious labour market challenges.Goa’s unemployment rate stands at 19.1%, with females experiencing much higher unemployment (31%) compared to males (13.2%). This sharp contrast in gender unemployment rates raises concerns about gender-specific barriers to employment in the state, despite its tourism-driven economy.Punjab faces an unemployment rate of 18.8%, with female unemployment at 24.5% and male unemployment at 16.7%. The state’s agricultural base and industrial growth have not translated into sufficient job opportunities for women, indicating the need for policies that foster more inclusive economic participation across genders.Andhra Pradesh rounds out the top 10 with an unemployment rate of 17.5%, featuring a female unemployment rate of 19.7% and a male unemployment rate of 16.4%. While the gap between genders is narrower here, the overall high rate of youth unemployment suggests a skills mismatch in the state’s labour market.","Despite impressive economic growth, a significant gap persists between this expansion and the labour market, particularly among the youth.

LUDHIANA: Cyber cheats from Assam and Bengal duped industrialist and Padma Bhushan awardee S P Oswal , chairperson of the $1.1bn Vardhman Group , of Rs 7 crore by purportedly masquerading as members of a CBI team probing misuse of his Aadhaar for passport and financial fraud, Ludhiana Police said Sunday after arresting two suspects from Guwahati the previous day and recovering Rs 5.2crore from them.Investigators said this was the highest amount seized in a cybercrime case in the country, based on data available with MHA’s Indian Cyber Crime Coordi nation Centre.Ludhiana police commissioner Kuldeep Singh Chahal said Vardhman Group lodged a complaint after Oswal realised he had been tricked into transferring money to two accounts. Till late Sunday, nobody from the company was available for comment.Atnu Chaudhary and Anand Kumar Chaudhary, the arrested men, were part of a nine-member gang that allegedly convinced Oswal about CBI registering a case against him after finding that his Aadhaar had been used to send a parcel to Malaysia containing 58 fake passports and 16 debit cards.The web of deceit started with a person claiming to be a CBI officer from Mumbai calling the industrialist, the police commissioner said . The imposter then made a video call , wearing a police uniform and seated in an office with CBI’s logo in the background. He sent a fake “arrest warrant” to Oswal over WhatsApp, claiming it was authorised by SC .The caller got Oswal to transfer Rs 7 crore to two bank accounts for bail proceedings and claimed he was being placed under “digital arrest”. After Oswal’s team lodged the complaint, investigators promptly initiated a process to get thebank accounts frozen , the police said.Inspector Jatinder Singh, SHO of Ludhiana cybercrime police station, said the gang member asked Oswal to transfer Rs 4 crore to one account and deposit Rs 3 crore in three transactions into a second bank account.By the time the accounts were frozen, the suspects withdrew Rs 1.7 crore . “We have already returned to the complainant the Rs 5.2crore that was seized,” Singh said.","S P Oswal, chairperson of the $1.1bn Vardhman Group, was duped of Rs 7 crore.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday demanded the resignation of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after an FIR was registered against her and others in Karnataka pertaining to the now scrapped electoral bond scheme . The party also sought an “objective probe” supervised by the courts to prevent “distortion or subordination”.The case was registered against Sitharaman and others including ED officials and office-bearers of BJP at the state and national levels on Saturday.The complaint was submitted by Adarsh R Iyer, co-president of Janaadhikaara Sangharsha Parishath (JSP), alleging that the accused “committed extortion under the guise and garb of electoral bonds”.At a press conference, Congress’s Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Jairam Ramesh said the FIR against the FM and others was registered at the direction of a special court in Karnataka and Congress had nothing to do with it. They demanded that Sitharaman resign on “moral, legal and political grounds”.Singhvi said his party hoped that that through the judicial process, those involved in this “corruption” would be summoned and their statements recorded and on that basis they would be arrested.Talking about the case registered in Bengaluru, Singhvi said Sitharaman was accused number one in the FIR, besides ED, BJP functionaries and others as they had allegedly “conspired together to extort money from companies through the electoral bond scheme”.“The finance minister cannot do this on her own. We know who is number one and number two (in government) and this was done on whose directions,” he said.","The case was registered against Sitharaman and others including ED officials and office-bearers of BJP at the state and national levels on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Former Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena (UBT) supremo Uddhav Thackeray has criticised the incumbent chief minister Eknath Shinde , accusing him of facilitating the relocation of various industrial projects from Maharashtra to Gujarat.Thackeray mentioned that there had been no news of such moves during his tenure.""When I was the chief minister, did you hear even a single news that any project from here went to Gujarat? In the last two and a half years, since this Mindhe (Shinde) became chief minister, so many industries have gone to Gujarat.Everything is being taken to Gujarat. Mumbai's economic centre has also been taken to Gujarat. We are not just fighting for power, but our fight is against the looting of Maharashtra,"" Thackeray said at an event in Ramtek where he unveiled a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Thackeray pointed out that Maharashtra missed out on the Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor project worth Rs 1.54 lakh crore, which was secured by Gujarat in September 2022.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief also alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah seeks to ""finish"" him and senior NCP leader Sharad Pawar.

Goons are coming into this BJP, corrupt people are coming. Do you agree with this? Amit Shah is coming to finish me and Sharad Pawar, will you let us be finished?

"23 terror hits in J&K so far this year, down from 222 in 2014",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/23-terror-hits-in-jk-so-far-this-year-down-from-222-in-2014/articleshow/113797640.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The marked improvement in security situation in J&K since the last assembly elections — with terror-related incidents this year down to one-tenth of the levels seen in 2014 — has been a major contributory factor in the good turnouts witnessed in most parts of Kashmir region, according to J&K administration sources. This, an official said, is significant as these are the first assembly polls in J&K after the nullification of Article 370 and its reorganisation into a Union Territory in 2019.However, polling percentages in all but one district of Jammu division, where voting is over, have dipped sincembere 2014.A plausible explanation could be the recent spike in terror activities in the region, among other things. Till Sept 27, 15 terror attacks and encounters had left 11 civilians and 17 security personnel dead in Jammu region.Of the 13 J&K districts that went to the polls in the first two phases on Sept 18 and 25, eight recorded average turnouts lower than in 2014 assembly polls. While five of these 13 districts are in Jammu region, three are in Kashmir Valley.Only one among the six Jammu districts where polling has been conducted in Phase 1 and 2 has shown a rise in voter turnout as compared to the 2014 polls, while four of the seven such districts in Kashmir recorded an upward trend in polling percentages. A comparison with 2024 LS polls shows that all but one district — Reasi in Jammu region — witnessed a lower turnout in the current polls.Reasi had witnessed the biggest terror attack of the year in July, with firing by terrorists on a bus killing eight passengers and the bus driver. Also, encounters with terrorists have caused multiple security forces casualties in Poonch and Rajouri in the recent months.Overall, terror-related incidents in J&K are down from 222 in 2014 to 23 so far this year, with 15 reported in Jammu region and 8 in Kashmir. Security forces’ fatalities too have fallen to 25, of which 17 were in Jammu region alone, from 47 in 2014, as have civilian killings from 28 in 2014 to 16 (11 in Jammu region & 5 in the Valley) in 2024.As many as 45 terrorists were killed this year against 110 in 2014. Of these, 35, including 18 foreign terrorists and 17 local terrorists, were neutralised in Kashmir while Jammu saw the end of 10 terrorists.As compared to 2014 that saw 23 grenade attacks, nine IED strikes and 41 hartal calls, 2024 has witnessed zero such incidents. “Four of the seven districts — Kulgam, Shopian, Pulwama and Srinagar, all once terror hotbeds — fared better in terms of voter turnout as compared to 2014 assembly polls,” a security official pointed out.Even the campaign and the two polling days so far were peaceful and incident-free, with no poll boycotts called by the separatists, who rather joined the democratic exercise as candidates, or the usual law and order disruptions like stone-pelting that would keep the Kashmiri voters indoors, said another officer.","Terror-related incidents in J&K are down to one-tenth of the levels seen in 2014.

The Iran-backed Hezbollah on Saturday confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in Israeli airstrikes on Friday. Recently, Israel eliminated several functionaries of the militant group and now it faces concern of who will succeed Nasrallah.According to several reports, Hashem Safieddine is considered a potential heir to Nasrallah. News agency Reuters citing a source within Hezbollah said that Safieddine survived the Israeli strikes.Hashem Safieddine is a cousin of the late leader Nasrallah and as the head of the executive council oversees Hezbollah’s political affairs.He is also a cleric who wears the black turban that signifies descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed. He also serves on the group's Jihad Council .Safieddine's family ties and religious status as a descendant of Mohammed would all work in his favor as a potential successor, reported news agency Reuters.In 2017, the US State Department designated him as a terrorist, and in June, he threatened major escalation against Israel following the death of another Hezbollah commander. At the funeral, he warned, ""Let (the enemy) prepare himself to cry and wail.""Safieddine's public statements often reflect Hezbollah's militant stance and its alignment with the Palestinian cause. At a recent event in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, he declared, ""Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you,"" in a show of solidarity with Palestinian fighters.According to Philip Smyth, an expert on Iran-backed Shi-ite militias, said Nasrallah ""started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out and speak,""He has also been outspoken in his criticism of US policy. In 2017, responding to American pressure on Hezbollah, he said, ""This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by Trump will not be able to harm the resistance,"" maintaining that such actions would only bolster Hezbollah's determination.Hassan Nasrallah joined the list of some of the important leaders and commanders Israel recently assassinated amid the conflicts that started on October 07, 2023, following a brutal attack by Hamas on Israel killing over a thousand people. Here are some of the other functionaries that were killed in recent months.The Hamas chief was assassinated in the early hours of July 31 in Iran. He was killed in a state guest house where he was staying while he was in the Iranian capital to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian.Earlier, on April 10, an Israeli air strike targeted the car carrying three of Haniyeh's sons - Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad - resulting in their deaths, along with four of Haniyeh's grandchildren, including three girls and a boy, according to Hamas.Hezbollah commander Qubaisi was killed in an airstrike on the southern suburbs of Beirut on September 24 killed Qubaisi.Hezbollah's operations commander was killed by an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 20. He was also a member of Hezbollah's top military body, the Jihad Council. The United States accused him of a role in the Beirut truck bombings that struck the American embassy in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and a US Marine barracks six months later that killed 241 people.Ahmed Wahbi, a top commander who oversaw the military operations of the Radwan special forces in the Gaza war was killed in a strike along with Ibrahim Aqil on September 20.Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike at Lebanon's capital on July 30.

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that India would have been willing to provide Pakistan with a financial aid package larger than what the country is currently seeking from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ), had Islamabad maintained friendly relations with New Delhi.""I said, my Pakistani friends, why have strained relations, we are neighbours.If we had good relations, we would have given more money than the IMF,"" defence minister said.Speaking in the Gurez assembly segment of Bandipora district, Singh said that the government is dedicated to the development of Jammu and Kashmir, citing the substantial Rs 90,000 crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014-15. He argued that this commitment to the region starkly contrasts with Pakistan’s reliance on international financial assistance.During his speech, Singh invoked former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's remark that ""we can change friends, but we cannot change our neighbours,"" urging Pakistan to reconsider its strained relations with India.The defence minister criticised Pakistan for allegedly misusing financial aid to fund terrorism . He highlighted that India’s financial support for Jammu and Kashmir is aimed at fostering development and expressed hope that the region could once again become a ""paradise on earth,"" aligning with Vajpayee's vision of restoring ""Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, and Kashmiriyat.""Singh said that Pakistan's use of terrorism as a tool against India has led to its isolation on international platforms, with even traditional allies distancing themselves.""Whenever we have investigated terrorism, we have found Pakistani involvement. Our successive governments have tried to make Pakistan understand that they should stop terror camps but to no avail. Pakistan is frustrated after revocation of Article 370 and is making attempts to revive terror. They do not want democracy to take roots here. (But) India is strong enough that it can take on Pakistan on its soil. If anyone in Pakistan carries out an attack on India, we can crossover and respond,"" he added.The defence minister also addressed local concerns in Gurez, promising increased recruitment from the area into the Indian Army if BJP candidate Faqeer Mohammad Khan is elected. He reiterated the demand for an all-weather tunnel through the Razdan Pass, which would enhance connectivity to the rest of the country.With improvements in infrastructure, including 24-hour electricity and better roads, Singh assured residents that discussions would be held post-elections to address their needs further.

NEW DELHI: Putting the onus of deciding whether life support should be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient or not would impose undue stress on doctors, Indian Medical Association has said.According to Dr R V Asokan , IMA's national president, such clinical decisions have always been taken in good faith by doctors.""Our job is to inform the patient or her or his family member about the condition and explain to them about the prognosis.After that, it is their call as to whether they want to continue life support or not. This guideline, however, intends to create a framework defining the role of doctors which is concerning for us,"" he said.The draft guideline put out by the health ministry for public comments on the issue suggests life support can be withdrawn from a terminally ill patient if both the primary board and the secondary medical board constituted by a hospital and the family or surrogate of the patient give their consent. It is applicable to patients who are terminally ill, and not expected to benefit from life sustaining treatments (LST) that include (but are not limited to) mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures, parenteral nutrition or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).According to the guideline, the primary medical board (PMB) which must assess the inappropriateness of life support should consist of the primary physician and at least two subject experts with at least five years of experience. After that, the decision is to be verified further by the secondary medical board (SMB) which should consist of one registered medical practitioner (RMP) nominated by the CMO and at least two subject experts.A member of the PMB cannot form part of the SMB. Additionally, the govt guideline suggests, the hospital may constitute a clinical ethics committee of multi-professional members for audit, oversight and conflict resolution.Dr Sushma Bhatnagar , who heads the cancer centre at AIIMS , was also involved in the development of the govt guideline. She said, ""In medicine, we all have learnt how to diagnose and how to treat but no one has taught us what should be our approach when end is inevitable. Thus, we keep treating a person even if we know that there is no chance of recovery. And finally the person may not survive even after we have provided all sorts of technologically-advanced treatment with best equipment at hand.

SRINAGAR: Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India would have offered more aid to Pakistan, had the neighbouring country maintained good relations with it.Addressing an election rally in the Gurez assembly segment of Bandipora district in north Kashmir, Singh said India would have given a larger bailout package to Pakistan than that sought by Islamabad from IMF , had the neighbouring nation maintained friendly relations with Delhi.“Modi ji had, in 2014-15, announced a special package for development of J&K, which has now reached Rs 90,000 crore. The amount is much bigger than what Pakistan was seeking from the IMF (as bailout package),” Singh said.Singh referred to former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee’s famous statement that “we can change friends, but we cannot change the neighbours.”“My Pakistani friends, why have strained relations, we are neighbours. If we had good relations, we would have given you more money than the IMF,” he added.Singh said while the Centre gives money to J&K for development, Pakistan has been misusing financial aid for a long time. “It seeks money from other countries to run a terrorism factory on its soil,” he added.He said India would crossover and respond if Pakistan carried out any terror attack on Indian soil. “Pakistan, which has used terrorism as a tool against India, has been isolated at international fora with some of its trusted allies too stepping back. Even Turkey, which used to support Pakistan, has not mentioned Kashmir at the UNGA,” he said.“Whenever we have investigated terror acts, we have found Pakistani involvement. Our successive govts have tried to make Pakistan understand that they should stop terror camps but to no avail. Pakistan is frustrated after the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir and is making attempts to revive the days of terror. They do not want democracy to take root here. India is strong enough to take on Pakistan on its soil,” he said.Reiterating the promises made in the BJP’s election manifesto, Singh said, “As the defence minister, I assure you that if (BJP candidate) Faqeer Mohammad Khan wins, more people from Gurez will be recruited in the Indian Army.”","Rajnath Singh said India would have given a larger bailout package to Pakistan than that sought by Islamabad from IMF.

GURGAON: Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday asserted that the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, will be passed in the winter session of Parliament , setting the stage for a potential showdown with the opposition both inside and outside the House.""Waqf board law... we will fix it in the next session of Parliament,"" Shah said while addressing an election meeting in Badshahpur in Gurgaon.Shah's declaration came even as opposition parties remain stridently ranged against the waqf bill , claiming that it was based on unfounded fears of existing waqf boards and was unnecessary.They also claimed that it amounted to interference with the constitutionally mandated religious rights granted to minorities.Govt has denied the charges and argued that the bill was intended to bring transparency in the functioning of waqf authorities and check their arbitrary powers.A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) headed by BJP's Jagdambika Pal is scrutinising the bill. Deliberations of the panel have been marred by multiple clashes with opposition members duelling with those of BJP. Many eyebrows were raised when the JPC received 1.25 crore mails on the bill, which led senior BJP MP and JPC member Nishikant Dubey to allege a plot to derail the legislation. He has urged the home ministry to order a probe.Shah, who addressed three rallies in Haryana on Sunday, also said 5 lakh youths from the state would get govt jobs with a provision for pension over the next five years if BJP continued in office for a third term.He reiterated his promise of ""pakki pension wali sarkari naukri (govt jobs with pension) for Agniveers after they completed their four-year stint in the armed forces. On Friday in Rewari, which has strong links with the Army, Shah had said both central and state govts had made provisions to absorb Agniveers in various sectors after they completed their tenure.""We will provide jobs to 5 lakh youths without any parchi and kharchi. Congress candidates are talking about the quota system in jobs. They don't believe in merit, we do,"" he told the gathering.Jobs have been a recurrent issue in the run-up to assembly elections. Most candidates have made promises regarding jobs in their campaign speeches. Congress, in its manifesto, has promised 2 lakh jobs if it comes to office.Like his campaign in Rewari, Shah once again dubbed Rahul Gandhi a ""lie machine"" and accused Congress of spreading misinformation about the Agnipath. ""The scheme was brought to keep the Army young,"" Shah said. He described Congress as a party of ""dalal, dealer and damaad"". ""During Congress rule, the party worked for only one district and a particular community. In Gurgaon, Cong destroyed hundreds of acres to make Delhi's damaad rich,"" he said.",Shah's declaration came even as opposition parties remain stridently ranged against the waqf bill.

North India logs its best monsoon in 11 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-logs-its-best-monsoon-in-11-years/articleshow/113793693.cms,"Monsoon at record high

NEW DELHI: This has been the wettest monsoon in north India in 11 years. The region, often plagued by large monsoon deficits while staring at a worsening groundwater situation, recorded 628mm from June 1 to Sept 29, its highest rainfall since 2013.That this was the best monsoon in the region in over a decade with the seasonal rainfall just 7.1% above normal - less than the national average of 7.8% - shows that north India hasn't had a significantly wet June-Sept period in recent years.Meanwhile, this year's monsoon season is set to officially end on Monday with India having received the highest rainfall since 2020 and recorded the lowest number of subdivisions with deficient rains - three out of 36 - since 2019. Overall, the monsoon is set to be 7-8% higher than the long period average (LPA), in the 'above-normal' category. This marks the sixth year in a row that the country has seen normal to above-normal rainfall in the season. In north India, where showers have persisted till the fourth week of Sept, the plains have received better rainfall than the hill states, with the exception of Punjab, which is one of the three deficit subdivisions with a seasonal shortfall of 28%.Other subdivisions in the plains have received rains in the normal range (-20 to +20% of LPA), the exceptions being west Rajasthan (excess rainfall) and east Rajasthan (above normal). Rains in late Sept, particularly in UP, augur well for soil moisture for rabi crops which will be sown from late Oct onwards.The region with by far the highest surplus this monsoon is central India. It has received nearly 20% higher-than normal rainfall at 1,165.6mm, making it the wettest monsoon in the region since 2019. As central India's output closely mirror's monsoon's performance across the country, this is the sixth straight year of normal to above-normal seasonal rainfall in the region. In 2019, the year of 'excess' monsoon in the country, central India had logged 1263.2mm of rain, 29% above the LPA. After central India, the South logged the second highest rain surplus in the country. The region has recorded 811.4mm of rain since June 1, 14.3% above the LPA. East & Northeast is the only region in the country to show arain deficit during this monsoon at 13.7%.This year's monsoon was expected to have been propelled by two largescale factors - La Nina in the Pacific and a 'positive dipole' in the Indian Ocean. Both failed to materialise. ""While these remained neutral, intra-seasonal factors came into play to aid rainfall,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief. An equatorial storm system called MJO remained in favourable phases from the end of June till mid-Sept, leading to formation of higher-than-normal number of low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, which travelled inland and caused rainfall.""","This has been the wettest monsoon in north India in 11 years.

NEW DELHI: With the huge trust deficit with China continuing along the Line of Actual Control, India is going full steam ahead with preparations to maintain its forward deployment of troops for the fifth successive winter in the forbidding terrain of eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh-Sikkim.There may be indications of ""progress and narrowing of differences"" in political-diplomatic talks, but top sources in the defence establishment told TOI that ""the trust deficit on the ground with the People's Liberation Army PLA ) remains very high"".The way China continues to strengthen its forward military positions as well as build 'permanent defences' and infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC , it is quite clear the PLA will not be returning to its peacetime locations in the near future, the sources added.As the Army transitions from 'the summer to winter posture', with massive 'winter stocking' underway for the additional troops forward deployed along the frontier, General Upendra Dwivedi and the commanders-in-chief of the force's seven commands will also review the operational situation at a meeting to be held in Gangtok (Sikkim) on Oct 9-10.Talk of a possible breakthrough in the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh has been fuelled by a flurry of bilateral political-diplomatic talks over the last couple of months. These included the 30th and 31st meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on July 31 and Aug 29, which were followed by a meeting between national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on the side-lines of a BRICS meet at St Petersburg on Sept 12.The rival military corps commanders, however, held their 21st round of talks way back on Feb 19. China had then once again rebuffed India's push for defusing the two major continuing face-offs at the strategically-located Depsang Plains, which is towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie and Karakoram Pass in the north, and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok.""Disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, if it happens, will only be the first step. Till the subsequent de-escalation and de-induction of troops take place for restoration of status quo ante, the threat will remain,"" a senior officer said.The creation of buffer zones after the earlier troop disengagements at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso-Kailash Range and Gogra-Hot Springs up till Sept 2022 as well as the confrontation at Depsang and Demchok has meant that Indian troops cannot access 26 of their 65 patrolling points (PPs), which begin from the Karakoram Pass in the north and go down to Chumar in the south in eastern Ladakh.""Even the buffer zones were meant to be only temporary arrangements. China continues to make unreasonable demands and is playing the long waiting game. India has to be careful about not falling into China's trap,"" the officer said.There is, of course, the realization that with the military stalemate persisting, only politico-diplomatic talks can break the deadlock.“If the two sides agree to a broad framework, the actual disengagement modalities at Depsang and Demchok can be worked out at the military level,” he added.The Army, meanwhile, is maintaining ‘a high level of operational preparedness’, with readjustment of troops along with adequate reserve forces and logistics in each sector of the LAC, to deal with any contingency","India is going full steam ahead with preparations to maintain its forward deployment of troops for the fifth successive winter in the forbidding terrain of eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh-Sikkim.

"Government expands adoption pool for children in CCIs, prioritising those with unfit guardians & no family visitations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-expands-adoption-pool-for-children-in-ccis-prioritising-those-with-unfit-guardians-no-family-visitations/articleshow/113793066.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The government has set off the process to verify and include in the foster care and adoption pool of the Central Adoption Resources Authority children above six years living in child care institutions (CCIs) who have not been visited by anyone from their family for a stipulated period of time or whose guardians have been found to be unfit to take care of them due to any mental or terminal illness.States are verifying and processing all these cases for inclusion in the pool. Speaking at the closing session of the national consultation organised under the aegis of the Supreme Court ’s Juvenile Justice Committee and Unicef on the protection of the rights of children with disabilities , women and child development secretary Anil Malik shared that to include the identified children in the adoption pool two new categories are being added pertaining to cases involving “unfit guardians” and “no visitations”. These new categories have been added in addition to the existing categories of orphaned, abandoned, and surrendered (OAS) children in the adoption pool of the Central Adoption Resources Authority.Nearly 15,000 children, across these categories, who can be moved to the adoption pool from CCIs have been identified across institutions in the country.The Supreme Court had in Nov 2023 directed the government to identify and register all such children languishing in CCIs and those not reaching the care institutions without any delay.The WCD secretary reiterated that the step to include these older children in CCIs in the adoption pool was in line with the view of integrating as many children with the mainstream by trying to see that they grow up in a family and have a social upbringing and not be left to grow in the confines of a children home.“As far as children registered under the category of ‘no visitation’ and ‘ unfit guardians ’ are concerned, they will primarily be potential cases for foster care. Once such children are declared legally free, their permanent rehabilitation can be facilitated through adoption,” CARA had stated in its memorandum issued earlier this year to all state adoption resource authorities, district child protection units, specialised adoption agencies and child care institutions.While emphasising the growing focus on foster care, Malik also emphasised that to step-up adoptions of children with disabilities the process has been streamlined which has given an impetus to the adoptions in this category not just by foreigners and NRIs but also prospective parents from within the country. Malik said they were noticing a positive change in attitudes. The WCD secretary shared that in 2022-23, 152 children with disabilities were adopted. This rose to 309 last year and so far this year, around 150 children have already found a family.","Nearly 15,000 children, across these categories, who can be moved to the adoption pool from CCIs have been identified.
