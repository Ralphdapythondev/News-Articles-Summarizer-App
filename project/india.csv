Why caste quota is a hot button in Karnataka politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-caste-quota-is-a-hot-button-in-karnataka-politics/articleshow/109708762.cms,"National Scene

PM Modi may have sparked a row by accusing Congress of snatching reservation from OBCs and SC/STs to give it to Muslims , but in Karnataka, which he cited as an example, the issue has dominated multiple elections, including the 2023 assembly polls that Congress won.In fact, the action in Karnataka precedes the demand for a caste census by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, which came on the heels of a statewide survey in Bihar.Responding to the PM’s criticism, Kharge told TOI: “While it is popularly being called a caste census, what we are proposing to do is a socioeconomic and educational survey that aims to assess and identify communities eligible for welfare schemes. We’ve already implemented several schemes like MGNREGA, which aren’t based on caste but on needs of all communities. Modi is making the issue communal solely for electoral gain.”Karnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue — much like with ‘guarantees’ this season — and a report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde, now Congress candidate from UdupiChikmagalur. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.Campaign plots of LS polls in Karnataka include the OBC narrative. If Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda credentials is Congress’s lead actor, BJP has been projecting PM Modi as the OBC face.Shivaraj Thangadagi, Karnataka backward classes welfare minister, told TOI: “Our govt has done what none had before by accepting the report. Its implementation will not only benefit backward communities but also the party, for sticking to its commitment. The concerns of other communities will be addressed while implementing this.”Union home minister Amit Shah and Karnataka leader of opposition R Ashoka have reiterated how BJP was with OBCs with Modi being “sabse bada (biggest) OBC” during their campaigns in the state.Nationally, Nitish Kumar — who had commissioned the Bihar caste survey — leaving INDIA and Congress being concerned about caste matrices across states may have seen the party use the OBC card cautiously, but it has included it in its national manifesto, while BJP continues to actively woo these communities.“Congress didn’t tolerate leaders from extremely backward classes. In 1987, Congress refused to accept Karpoori Thakurji as opposition leader whom we honoured a few days ago with Bharat Ratna. These days, Congress colleagues express concern about the number of people from backward classes in govt, where they’re positioned… But I’m surprised they don’t notice the biggest OBC (referring to himself),” Modi told Parliament on Feb 5.The PM referring to himself as the biggest OBC came close on the heels of Rahul claiming that Modi’s Teli caste was not part of other backward classes.India’s first proper caste enumeration was under the British in 1931. Subsequently, while the Constitution addressed education and job reservations for SC/STs, the first independent govt realised there were numerous underprivileged backward commu nities, resulting in the Kaka Kalekar commission in 1953, which recommended a castewise census enumeration in the 1961 Census.But it was Mandal Commission’s 1980 report that proved pivotal, identifying 3,742 OBC communities and recommending 52% quotas — though only 27% reservations were implemented by V P Singh’s govt in 1989 amid violent protests and legal battles.A landmark 1993 Supreme Court judgment (Indira Sawhney case) capped overall reservations at 50% but allowed exceptions. It also introduced the ‘creamy layer’ excluded from reservation, based on annual income limits, currently Rs 8 lakh.Karnataka Pioneers Mysore ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar appointed the Leslie Miller commission to examine non-Brahmin underrepresentation in 1918, despite opposition from then Divan M Visvesvaraya.Post-Independence, Nagana Gowda Commission (1960) recommended 45% job and 50% education quotas for OBCs, excluding Lingayats, which prevented implementation. Then, the 1975 LG Havanur panel raised the quantum to 32% across the three categories it introduced. But the exclusion of Lingayats again caused friction.To address this, the T Venkataswamy commission was formed, which, in its 1986 re port, included some Lingayat sub-castes and, again, the 1990 O Chinnappa Reddy commission included Muslims, Vokkaligas and Lingayats, but the latter two were dissatisfied with the representation. This finally led to creation of a permanent BC commission, with the first in 1994 led by Kudur Narayana Pai.The Chinnappa Reddy report recommendation was implemented in 1994-95 and has since been used as the matrix for reservations in the state.And in 2015, CM Siddaramaiah set up the H Kantharaju commission to carry out a socio-economic educational survey, commonly called caste survey. While Siddaramaiah’s tenure ended before the report could be submitted, leaked contents created heartburn among Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Subsequent govts didn’t accept the report citing reasons, including a technicality that the membersecretary hadn’t signed it. This prompted the Jayaprakash Hegde commission to revisit the Kantharaju panel report. The Hegde commission has since submitted its report to the Siddaramaiah govt.In between, BJP’s Basavaraj Bommai govt had in Dec 2022 rejigged the categories based on which existing reservation was being implemented. It removed Muslims and added an additional quota for Vokkaligas and Lingayats. But its implementation is stalled as a case is pending before Supreme Court.",Karnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue. A report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109708776,imgsize-64038,width-400,resizemode-4/109708776.jpg"

’

BALAKOT: PM Modi revealed on Monday the untold story of how he ensured Pakistan was the first to officially hear about the 2019 Balakot airstrike, linking it to BJP-governed “new India’s policy of looking an adversary in the eye and speaking the truth rather than resorting to stealth”.“I instructed our forces to notify media about the airstrike , albeit after I had informed Pakistani authorities over phone that we have carried out an airstrike, killed these many people and caused this much destruction.But they wouldn’t take calls,” he said at a rally in Navanagar in Bagalkot, north Karnataka. “I then directed the forces to postpone disclosure until after I managed to contact them... Modi doesn’t believe in hiding or attacking from behind, he fights openly.”PM Modi harked back to Balakot in Bagalkot, recounting with amusement initial rumours about an airstrike happening in the similar-sounding north Karnataka district after word got out of warplanes hitting terror targets.The Navanagar rally, Modi’s fifth campaign stop in north Karnataka in 24 hours, saw him doubling down, once again, on his tirade against Congress for its votebank politics, including “reservation for Muslims” in violation of the Constitution.Modi said Congress snatched slices of the quota pie from Dalits, SC/STs and OBCs and handed these to Muslims by putting them on the OBC list. “BJP is ramping up the share of SC/ST/OBCrepresentation by encouraging them to enter public life, which Congress is unable to tolerate.”He said the Siddaramaiah govt had “stooped so low” as to collect money even from tanker owners supplying water to parched areas of Bengaluru.Modi started his speech in Kannada, invoking the deity Badami Banashankari, saint Basavanna and Siddeshwar Swamiji of Jnanayogashrama.When a girl in the audience, later identified as Nagaratna Meti, held up an image of the PM with his late mother Heeraben Modi, he asked an SPG commando to get him the photo with the child’s name and address on it, and promised to write to her. Party candidates PC Gaddigoudar (Bagalkot) and Ramesh Jigajinagi (Bijapur) shared the dais along with BJP ’s state president BY Vijayendra, former CM BS Yediyurappa, and a few ex-ministers.North Karnataka will vote during the third phase of elections on May 7.","PM Modi reveals how he ensured Pakistan was the first to officially hear about the 2019 Balakot airstrike. “I instructed our forces to notify media about the airstrike, albeit after I had informed Pakistani authorities over phone that we have carried out an airstrike, killed these many people and caused this much destruction,” he said at a rally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109708393,imgsize-1460174,width-400,resizemode-4/109708393.jpg"

US report names RAW man involved in alleged plot to take out Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-report-names-raw-man-involved-in-alleged-plot-to-take-out-pannun/articleshow/109708372.cms,"US Pannun plot probe involves CIA, FBI, others

A report in Washington Post, a US newspaper, has claimed that a Research and Analysis Wing officer, Vikram Yadav , instructed a hired hit team to kill US-based Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun .According to the report, “US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel .” It adds that Yadav was transferred back to CRPF after the Pannun plot unravelled last year.There was no response by the Indian govt to the assertions made in the report till late Monday night.US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official they referred to in the indictment as CC-1.Gupta is currently in a jail in Prague, where he was detained last year by Czech and US agencies. While India had formed a high-level committee in Nov to probe the information shared by the US about the role of the Indian official, saying it had a bearing on India’s security too, the govt has so far not revealed any of its findings.RAW officer Vikram Yadav, who was on deputation from CRPF, allegedly forwarded details of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, including his address in New York, said a Washington Post report, citing sources and a US indictment. The official is now back with the central paramilitary force.Given his background, Yadav “lacked training and skills” needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated US counter-intelligence capabilities, the Post said. According to the report, senior officials at the US justice department and FBI had pushed to prosecute Yadav, a step that would have implicated RAW in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. “But while a US indictment unsealed in November contained the bombshell allegation that the plot was directed by an Indian official, it referred to Yadav as only an unnamed co-conspirator, CC-1, and made no mention of the Indian spy agency,” it said.“Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to Modi’s inner circle,” the report said.","US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official.

India fumes at Trudeau taking part in pro-Khalistan event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fumes-at-trudeau-taking-part-in-pro-khalistan-event/articleshow/109708322.cms,"Trudeau seen smiling at pro-Khalistan rally

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner on Monday and strongly protested the unabashed chanting of separatist pro-Khalistan slogans at an event addressed by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau .Trudeau addressing a ‘ Khalsa Day ’ gathering in Toronto, which flaunted ‘Modi wanted’ banners, has left the Indian intelligence establishment alarmed, sources said.The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged, and has incited violence against Indian diplomats in Canada .Addressing the event, Trudeau vowed to protect the rights and freedoms of Sikhs. India has in the past blamed Trudeau’s “vote-bank politics” for Canada’s reluctance to rein in pro-Khalistan leaders who continue to target Indian interests in the country.A huge banner at the event identified PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar as “Nijjar’s killers”.Trudeau pushed bilateral ties into a downward spiral by saying Canadian law enforcement had uncovered a “plot” by India to eliminate Nijjar, wanted for terrorist crimes and who has been blamed for the killing of a Sikh for taking control of a rich gurdwara.Trudeau, who also raised his allegation with Modi, is yet to back the claim he made in public that Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Agency had got evidence of India’s hand in Nijjar’s killing and had identified those who pulled the trigger.Also, while he said that he had got the evidence from a fellow member of Five Eyes Alliance, an Anglosphere intelligence group comprising US, UK, New Zealand and Australia, other members of the grouping have not allowed the episode to cast a shadow on their ties with New Delhi.The latest incident triggered an angry protest from MEA which conveyed govt’s “deep concern and strong protest” as disturbing actions were being allowed to continue unchecked at the event.The govt said the unchecked separatist activity once again illustrated the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence. “Their continued expressions not only impact India-Canada relations but also encourage a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,” it added.During Trudeau’s address, pro-Khalistan Sikhs demanded the prosecution of Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma for “orchestrating the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar”. In a video released by SFJ, Trudeau was seen smiling at the chants of “Khalistan zindabad”.SFJ chief Pannun said, “Trudeau’s address is reassuring that pro-Khalistan Sikhs’ right to campaign for liberation of Punjab from Indian occupation was protected under Canadian Charter of Rights and the liberal govt will always stand with Canadian Sikhs.”","The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged.

EtO is used by the spice industry to reduce microbial contamination, such as that of E coli and Salmonella.Another report by Public Eye, a Swiss body, and International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) claimed Nestle India was adding sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in countries like India.Of the samples tested by FSSAI between 2020-21 and 2022-23, nearly one out of four food samples was found non-confirming. Officials, however, clarified not all samples found to be non-conforming are unsafe. “A sample can be declared non-conforming for various reasons. This includes misbranding where a product and its content aren’t described properly, below the standard product and when products are considered unsafe to consume. Maximum defaulters fall in the first and second category,” a senior FSSAI official said.Over the years the number of samples picked up has increased from a little under 1.1 lakh in 2020-21 to 4.5 lakh in 2023-24.According to FSSAI Act, if samples are found sub-standard and misbranded, maximum penalty can be levied up to Rs 5 lakh for sub-standard food, up to Rs 3 lakh for misbranded food and up to Rs 10 lakh for misleading advertisements. “If samples are found unsafe, food businesses can be prosecuted under Section 59 of FSS Act, 2006 where a three-month jail term with penalty up to Rs 3 lakh can be levied where failure does not result in injury,” the official explained.","The samples will be collected from mandis, malls and mom-and-pop stores across the country.

As the Lok Sabha elections progress through their initial phases, gearing up for the third phase slated for May 7, attention is turning towards the 94 Lok Sabha constituencies across 12 states and union territories set to cast their votes.The mammoth task of constituting the 18th Lok Sabha spans from April 19 to June 1, structured into seven phases.This intricate electoral process, announced by the Election Commission on March 16, aims to elect the 543 members of the 18th Lok Sabha. Simultaneously, assembly elections will unfold in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.Dates of polling for the Lok Sabha are April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25, and June 1. States like Bihar, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh will witness voting across all seven phases. The crucial moment of counting votes is scheduled for June 4.On polling day, schools and colleges in these constituencies will remain closed, a measure often implemented due to safety concerns. Elections inherently bring about heightened tension and potential security issues, particularly in areas with a history of electoral violence or where disruption risks exist. Shutting down educational institutions ensures the safety of students and staff while preventing any disturbances during the voting process.Additionally, it facilitates the smooth movement of election officials and voters, as schools and colleges commonly serve as polling stations. This proactive step aims to encourage broader participation in the electoral process without concerns about disruptions to daily activities.","The mammoth task of constituting the 18th Lok Sabha spans from April 19 to June 1, structured into seven phases.

""You have to satisfy us how the high court went wrong,"" the CJI said.SC posted the next hearing for May 6.In an order passed last week, the Calcutta high court nullified the appointment of all the 25,753 teachers empanelled in 2016 for various categories of jobs at secondary and higher secondary schools in the state.A division bench of Justices Debangsu Basak and Shabbar Rashidi of the high court ordered that the candidates selected will have to return the entire salary drawn by them, along with an annualised interest of 12 per cent, within the next four weeks.Besides directing the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to start the recruitment process afresh, it also directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry on with its investigation into the matter.Taking cognisance of the state cabinet's decision for the creation of super-numeric posts, the Calcutta high court said that the CBI, if necessary, can question the masterminds behind the creation of the seats in excess of the vacant posts. These super-numeric posts, which have remained under the cloud since the beginning, are perceived to provide room for ineligible candidates recruited illegally.","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Calcutta high court's order terminating the appointment of 25,000 teachers recruited ""illegally"" in West Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Baba Ramdev crossed a red line when he claimed he could cure Covid-19 , said Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr R V Asokan. Criticizing yoga guru, the IMA chief also said Ramdev maligned modern medicine by calling it a ""stupid and bankrupt science"".Dr Asokan highlighted the potential consequences of such statements, particularly their adverse impact on public trust and healthcare practices.""He crossed a red line. We have been tolerating mediocracy in this country for too long. Our profession also has been tolerating this and we never wanted to prove anything to anyone. He crossed a line when he advertised about Coronil (a Patanjali tablet) and said WHO has approved it which was a wrong statement,"" Dr Asokan was quoted as saying.Dr Asokan addressed the issue amidst ongoing legal proceedings involving Ramdev and his multibillion-dollar consumer goods empire Patanjali Ayurved . This also comes a day before the top court is scheduled to hear the matter next.Dr Asokan said Ramdev went against the medical profession by saying ""modern medicine is a stupid and bankrupt science"".""He went against the national interest when the government was driving the vaccination programme. He said 20,000 doctors died after taking two doses of the Covid vaccine. And he was having such a high profile that you know people believed what he said. That was the unfortunate part of it,"" he said.TheSupreme Court 's recent rebuke of Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved over misleading advertisements prompted IMA's response. The court's observations raised concerns about the integrity of the Covid-19 vaccination drive and modern medical practices, prompting IMA to file a plea alleging a smear campaign against these initiatives.Dr Asokan emphasized the importance of ethical medical practices and expressed dismay over the Supreme Court's comments, which he deemed as undermining the profession's integrity.Dr Asokan said IMA is not against traditional systems of medicine. ""We have lived with all these decades. We respect each other. But somehow some sections of the society thought we are anti-traditional systems and, as for the public apology, it was to the Supreme Court. And it's more about the contempt of the court than the substance of the thing.""""I think the court has not said its final verdict. We need to wait.

Launch timings for some Isro missions had to be adjusted based on collision avoidance analyses to avoid potential close encounters.According to the report, 21 Indian satellites reentered Earth's atmosphere by the end of 2023, with eight satellites undergoing reentry in the year 2023 alone. Among these, the Megha-Tropiques-1 satellite underwent a meticulously planned and highly challenging controlled reentry.The report revealed that a total of 82 rocket bodies from Indian launches had been placed in orbit until the end of 2023. One notable incident occurred in 2001 when the upper stage of the PSLV-C3 rocket accidentally broke up, generating 371 pieces of debris. While most of these fragments have reentered the atmosphere, 52 PSLV-C3 debris remained in orbit until the end of 2023.Of the intact Indian upper stages, 35 rocket bodies had reentered the Earth's atmosphere by the end of 2023, with five such reentries occurring in 2023 alone.The report stated that Isro received more than 1.3 lakh close approach alerts from the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM). These alerts were re-assessed using more accurate orbital data of Indian operational satellites.""A total of 3,033 alerts were detected for close approaches within a distance of 1 kilometer, and around 2,700 close approaches were observed with other operational satellites within a 5-kilometer range,"" the report said.In certain instances, coordination was carried out with international agencies such as SpaceX and EUMETSAT to address potential close approaches. However, none of the close approaches were deemed critical enough to warrant a CAM.During 2023, Isro conducted a total of 23 CAMs to protect its space assets, marking an increase from 21 CAMs in 2022 and 19 in 2021.No concerning close approaches were detected for Chandrayaan-3 throughout its mission phases or for Aditya-L1 during its Earth-bound phase.""Operating in an environment inhabited by a growing population of active satellites requires Space Traffic Management,"" the report states, calling for the development of a universally accepted framework and the adoption of best practices for long-term sustainability of space activities.As the space sector continues to expand with more players and ambitious ventures like mega-constellations and space tourism, innovative solutions such as active debris removal and on-orbit servicing will be crucial to ensuring safe and sustainable operations in the increasingly crowded space environment.","Isro's annual Indian Space Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for 2023 shows continued growth of the space object population. 3,143 new objects added in 2023 from 212 launches and on-orbit breakup events globally, compared to 2,533 objects from 179 launches in 2022.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir have been grappling with continuous rainfall that has wreaked havoc in several regions including higher reaches. Torrential rains in the valley have triggered flash floods in parts of Kupwara in northern Kashmir causing damages to buildings and roads. Moreover, the Sarbal area of Sonamarg in central Kashmir's Ganderbal district bore the brunt of an avalanche that hit on Monday.Natural calamities compelled authorities to carry out rescue operations in affected areas. Schools in Kupwara were ordered closure amid heavy rains. Here are the top developments of the day:As heavy rain triggered a flood-like situation in areas of North Kashmir's Kupwara district, Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out rescue operations in flood-affected areas.The officials reported that the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, which is the sole all-weather route connecting Kashmir with the rest of India, was shut down on Monday due to several landslides caused by heavy rainfall that affected large areas of Jammu and Kashmir during the night. The highway was blocked by landslides at Mehar, Gangroo, Mom Passi and Kishtwari Pather in Ramban district.The ongoing rainfall is hindering the efforts to clear the debris and restore the highway, according to the officials. They advised travelers to refrain from using the highway until the debris is completely removed.Furthermore, the Mughal road, which serves as an alternative route connecting the Poonch and Rajouri districts in Jammu with the Shopian district in south Kashmir, has been closed for the past three days due to snowfall in Peer Ki Gali and the surrounding areas, as reported by the officials.Amid torrential rains in other parts of the valley, an avalanche hit the Sarbal area of Sonamarg, located in the Ganderbal district of central Kashmir today. No casualties or financial losses were reported, as the avalanche occurred on the forest side of the region, causing no damage, according to officials.Visuals show Project Beacon, a division of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), engaged in a snow-clearing operation at the affected site.In a separate incident the previous day, a team from the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) successfully rescued a total of 35 vehicles that were trapped in snow at Razdan Top, situated on the Bandipora-Gurez road in Jammu and Kashmir. BRO officials said that the vehicles were stranded due to adverse weather conditions, which included snowfall and snowstorms.Classes in schools across Kupwara were suspended today due to heavy rainfall. The decision was made by authorities as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of students.An official said, ""In view of inclement weather and an avalanche warning issued by the Jammu and Kashmir State Disaster Management Authority (JKSDMA), class work in all schools across the district is suspended on April 29 as a precautionary measure for the safety of students.""Despite the suspension of classes, teaching and non-teaching staff were instructed to attend to their duties to monitor the situation and safeguard the assets of their respective schools.In response to the persistent rainfall, officials in Kishtwar temporarily shut down educational institutions throughout the district. The decision to halt classes for the day was made with the primary goal of ensuring the protection and welfare of students and faculty members.According to an official around 8-10 houses were damaged due to heavy rain in Mandi Area of Poonch. SDM Ashfaq Hussain said, ""8-10 houses were damaged in heavy rainfall. Some houses are fully damaged and some are partially damaged. A few roads have also been damaged. A relief amount will be given to the affected as per the rules. We are providing tents to the affected families. We have identified vulnerable spots and places of alternate accommodation in the area.""Continuous rainfall over the past two days has caused water levels in various water bodies throughout Kashmir to increase. Officials have issued a danger warning specifically for Pohru Nallah in Kupwara due to the rising water levels.However, the water level in other water bodies, including the Jhelum river, is still below the alert mark. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of the residents in the affected areas.India Meteorological Department today issued an orange alert for Jammu and Kashmir predicting heavy rains (64.5-115.5 mm). The weather department also predicted isolated hailstorms, thunderstorms and lightning with gusty winds (40-50 kmph) over neighbouring states including Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on April 29.","Torrential rains in the valley have triggered flash floods in parts of Kupwara in northern Kashmir.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday discussed the changing perception of India on the global stage.Speaking at an event in Delhi's Kirori Mal College, Jaishankar emphasized that India's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission have had a significant impact on the way Indians are perceived abroad.Jaishankar noted that the world closely follows the decisions made in India, as it is the largest country and the fifth-largest economy.The minister highlighted that India's technological achievements, particularly the Chandrayaan-3 mission and Covid management, have been among the most impactful things done by the country in the past decade.""We are the largest country in the world. We are the fifth largest economy, soon we'll be the third. How we do at home is watched by everybody abroad. What decisions we make at home, is also very keenly followed by the world. So, if we are now in the coming weeks going to decide our future in whatever way we wish, it's not just a conversation amongst ourselves. It's a conversation or a discussion in which the other six billion people are also tuned in. These are all actually aspects of why Bharat matters,"" he said.Jaishankar also spoke about India's efforts to secure its citizens abroad during emergencies, such as Operation Ganga, which brought back Indian students from Ukraine. He emphasized that the Indian passport is now looked at with greater respect, as it shows that the government stands behind the person carrying that passport.The minister suggested that the ""real value of the passport"" should be determined by who will come to a person's aid when they are in trouble.Jaishankar said, ""The second is the manner in which we secure our citizens of India. Believe me, that has got everybody's attention in the world. You know, a lot of us rightly are very proud of how - I'll give you an example of how we got our students out of Ukraine in Operation Ganga. As I said, rightly so. But I also want you to know that there were many countries who actually told their students and their citizens, saying, sorry guys, there's nothing I can do. You now have to figure out your own way out.""""And these were not developing countries. They were even developed countries,who actually told their people, you are on your own. So, this change which has come about, that any Indian travelling anywhere has that sense, that look, you know, sometimes people talk about, you know, there's something called a passport index. And the passport index basically is based on how many places you don't need a visa for,"" he added.The minister also noted that people abroad are fascinated by India's domestic achievements, such as the ration card system, election system, and infrastructure progress.""The third is our performance at home. And I often share with my own colleagues in the cabinet and in the parliament that they think that when the foreign minister goes out of India, all the time we discuss foreign policy makes sense.""""But in reality, actually people abroad are enormously fascinated by what we are doing at home in the rest of our lives. They want to know how does your ration system work? How does your election system work? You know, how are you getting your gas cylinder? How are you getting your electricity connection? Why is it that it has changed because they have read all these stories,"" he added.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at an event in Delhi's Kirori Mal College.

Supreme Court agrees to consider plea seeking declaration Sharia won’t apply to ex-Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-agrees-to-consider-plea-seeking-declaration-sharia-wont-apply-to-ex-muslims/articleshow/109697864.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice while hearing a writ petition seeking a declaration that a person who was born a Muslim, but ceased to be a believer, would not be governed by the Shariat law . After thorough discussions, the bench, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud along with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, issued notices on the petition, considering it an ""important issue.""The bench highlighted that the Indian Succession Act prohibits individuals born into the Muslim faith from availing themselves of secular law, even if they formally declare under Section 3 of the Shariat Law that they no longer wish to follow Islamic law.Moreover, the bench asked the Attorney General for India to appoint a law officer who can provide assistance to the Court on this matter. The next hearing for this case is scheduled for the second week of July 2024.The writ petition has been lodged by Safiya PM, a woman from Kerala who serves as the general secretary of an association representing ex-Muslims in the region. In her plea, Safiya advocates for a declaration asserting that individuals who choose not to be bound by Muslim Personal Law should have the option to be governed by the secular laws of the nation, specifically the Indian Succession Act of 1925, in matters of both intestate and testamentary succession.You don’t necessarily need to seek that declaration. Because Section 3 of the Shariat Act says that unless you make a declaration, you will not be governed by the provisions of the personal law in the matter of wills, adoptions, and legacies. So if you don’t make a declaration, your father doesn’t make a declaration, they are not governed by the personal law,” the CJI said.However, later on, the bench, including Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, concurred with Safiya's counsel, Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan. ""There seems to be an issue here. Without a declaration, there remains a gap as the secular law does not automatically apply. Initially, we were unsure about the nature of this petition. However, now that we've delved into it, it appears to raise a significant point. We will proceed by issuing a notice,"" remarked CJI Chandrachud.The plea cited the Supreme Court's Sabarimala judgment, asserting that the fundamental Right to Religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India must include the freedom to believe or not to believe. It argued, ""For this Right to have significance, individuals who choose to leave their faith should not face any disability or disqualification in matters of inheritance or other significant civil rights.""The plea highlighted that the petitioner, ""a woman born into a Muslim family with a non-practicing Muslim father who has not formally renounced the religion, is encountering a unique challenge in safeguarding her fundamental civil rights."" It further stated that Safiya ""desires a declaration that she shall not be subject to Muslim Personal Law for any matters outlined in section 2 or 3 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. However, there is no provision either in the Act or its accompanying rules through which she can obtain such a certificate."" The plea argued that this represents a clear gap in the statute which could be addressed through judicial interpretation.""At present, even if the petitioner were to officially acquire a no-religion, no-caste certificate from any authority, she would still not be governed by the secular laws of the country, specifically the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Thus, the petitioner's fundamental rights under Article 25 are rendered futile due to the lack of such protection from the State,"" it added.","The writ petition has been lodged by Safiya PM, a woman from Kerala who serves as the general secretary of an association representing ex-Muslims in the region.

‘India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power’: PM Modi to TOI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-does-not-become-an-electoral-autocracy-if-yuvraj-cannot-get-power/articleshow/109674796.cms,"In an exclusive interview with Diwakar, Akhilesh Singh and Sidhartha, PM Narendra Modi took time off from his hyperkinetic electoral campaign to speak on a range of hot-button topics. Talking after the second round of polls, a confident PM said

NDA

was well on course to cross the 400+ target, with

reaching the 370 mark — the goal his party set keeping in mind the emotions linked to the abrogation of Article 370.

What is India's Modi vote share and meet the 'human deepfakes' of this election

TOI: What is your assessment after two rounds of polling? Are you still hopeful of crossing the 400 mark?

PM Modi

:

One of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give it to their vote bank are foiled. PM Modi on need for 400 seats

But the opposition says you are aiming for a super majority because you want to change the Constitution?

When you set 370 seats as the target for BJP and 400 for NDA, did you do so because you were concerned that complacency may set in among party cadres and even voters? You seem to have enlisted voters, setting a target for them as much as for yourself. But the optimistic ‘Abki Baar 400 Paar’ pitch and target of 370 seats for BJP also carries the risk of generating cadre complacency. Did you ever think that it might harm the party?

For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is anoutcome of my entire life in public service. PM Modi on Modi ki Gurantee

Rahul Gandhi

has said that it is too hubristic and BJP is headed for the ‘India Shining’ moment of 2004 when it had crashed to a shock defeat. Your comments? Unlike in 2004, when BJP pushed away allies, the party has this time enlisted new ones

The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will seethat our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way. PM Modi on South India

How do you assess your prospects in south India? You have made a big push in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Last time, BJP swept Karnataka but it suffered a big setback in the assembly polls. The talk is that your tally from the state will shrink. What is your assessment?

Congress’s guarantees played a big role in its victory in the assembly polls in Karnataka and Telangana. Do you think ‘Modi ki guarantee’ can trump them?

If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove their barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier-2, tier-3 cities which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, they just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. PM Modi on equitable growth

Congress has accused BJP of attempting communal polarisation in Karnataka and elsewhere while BJP has charged it with appeasement. How is this playing out?

Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. PM Modi on Ram Mandir

Is one nation, one poll going to be on the top of your ‘to do’ list in the third term? What about UCC? Will the Centre be an enabler or leave it to states?

We should not consider this sinister plan of Congress an idle threat — the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see Congress and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. Our constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of all other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony. PM Modi on wealth redistribution

Your opponents in Karnataka and elsewhere have raised the issue of a NorthSouth divide, claiming the Centre discriminates against southern states. Do you see merit in it or is it driven by their need to fund their guarantees?

What is your worry about the current pitch for redistribution of assets? You have said the govt should not be expropriating wealth and assets of people and that a plan to do that is a reflection of the Maoist vision which has caused havoc in so many countries. Do you see this as a real threat?

Uniform Civil Code is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in the states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the healthof society. We cannot be a nation, where one community is progressing with the support of the constitutional norms, while the other community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India. PM Modi on UCC

As the size of the Indian economy grows, there are discussions about equity and inequality. You don’t seem to see wealth tax and inheritance tax as solutions.

Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about ourpeople, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. PM Modi on Autocracy

Barring Ram Mandir, there has been no emotive issue in play this time around. You seem to be optimistic that people will consider improvements in their lives and prospects and give you a ‘positive’ vote. Cases relating to Kashi and Mathura temples are in court. Rather than wait for a lengthy legal process, can these issues be sorted out by discussions between religious leaders of both communities?

Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. A large number of people of this country are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them. PM Modi on other emotive issues

In 2019, welfare schemes ranging from Ujjwala to PM Awas Yojana had reached people for the first time on a big scale. Voters endorsed the schemes and voted for BJP. This time, the schemes are not so new or unique. Will delivery of schemes still be a factor that will influence voter choice the same way?

SC has given a good closure to the issue, highlighting the importance of EVMs. Oppn always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is possible only through paper ballots. PM Modi on allegations around EVMs

Sections of the opposition like INDIA consistently raised questions over the credibility of EVMs. They had alleged tampering in 2014 and, again, in 2019...

Opposition often alleges that there is threat to democracy and also that the country is moving towards being an ‘electoral autocracy’. The charge has found takers in many foreign capitals. Do you see it as a challenge?

The govt has been accused of misusing investigating agencies, particularly ED and CBI, to harass political opponents. It has also been alleged that ‘tainted’ politicians turn clean as soon as they join BJP.

One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. PM Modi on One Nation One Poll

In Delhi, we have a situation of a sitting CM being in jail. Although the law is silent on this, it is against convention. Do you see this becoming a precedent?

NDA-appointed governors have been at loggerheads with some opposition-governed state govts which have accused Raj Bhavans of interfering in their work. How would you respond to these allegations?

In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. PM Modi on last 10 years.

You have attempted to expand the concept of employment beyond govt jobs to selfemployment. Do you see your attempt succeeding in view of the entrenched bias for govt jobs?

Your vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ in 2047 is still 23 years away from becoming a reality. By the time it is realised, you will be close to 95 years. Still, to your supporters and many others, you are central to that vision.

You have been credited with raising India’s global stature with a more assertive and ambitious foreign policy. Tell us about your experience of having steered India in a conflict-ridden world in which the pursuit of our national interests seemed, at least to some of our partners in the West, to be at odds with the rules of the international order?

I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to develop our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces & cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-classdestinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not onlyhelp the pilgrims but also the local economy. PM Modi on Kashi and Mathura temple demand

If your assessment is proven right, you will equal Pandit Nehru’s record of scoring three straight wins. Your views on this rare feat also in view of the contrasting backgrounds you both came from.

I have done more than 70 rallies and roadshows so far, after the announcement of polls. Everywhere I have gone, I have seen an unprecedented display of love, affection and support. It is this support of the people that gives us confidence that we are on track to cross the 400 mark. The people have seen what we can deliver and we believe that the people want a better tomorrow, and they know that a vote for BJP means a vote towards development.The opposition is down and out after two phases of polling. In the first phase, it was out and after the second phase, it is out. For us, one of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give them to their vote bank are foiled.It is ironic that people who have changed the Constitution the maximum number of times are saying that we will change the Constitution. But before asking such a question, you should analyse my track record. You should study my work and actions right from the time I became CM and see if you find any such thing done by me. It is unfair to me if someone makes an allegation and you take that allegation on face value and start asking me questions on it.The party’s slogans reflect the sentiments of the people. It is the collective voice of the citizens who recognise our efforts and want to see even further change. But the genesis of this ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ slogan is very interesting and emotional. Article 370 has been a very emotional issue for us, our karyakartas and the people of India. People have waited for generations for this to happen. Abrogation of Article 370 has been a driving force for our karyakartas for decades. When people saw that our govt did this, it made them very emotional and the feeling among people was that we should give 370 seats to the party which abrogated Article 370. And hence, the slogan, ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ for the NDA emanated from among the people. It was an organic and a never-seen-before phenomenon where people are themselves setting a target for our victoryAs a karyakarta myself, I can attest that no complacency sets in within BJP. All top leaders of our party are constantly in the field, among the people. Our karyakartas are putting in huge efforts. In fact, in several places, you would find only BJP karyakartas at the booths. We are also seeing a large number of people who are passionate about the country taking time out to volunteer for BJP in cities as well as villages. This kind of support from society is helping us immensely. A new phenomenon that is being seen is the beneficiaries not only voting for us in large numbers, but also motivating others in their circle to do the same.The Congress party’s Yuvraj should be the last person to be talking about hubris. But it is true that now the Congress party is dependent only on shocks and surprises. Their only hope is that there will be some miracle to make them win the elections. Even their most veteran and important leaders have given up and conceded the elections. Each election is based on contemporary issues and, so, comparing them is not correct. In 2024, not only have we got new allies but we have unprecedented support of the people, which gives us the confidence of a spectacular win.The prospects are very good. It is not I who made a big push, it is, in fact, the other way round. The people of south India have made a big push to create space for BJP. Wherever you go in the South, the acceptance and affection shown by the people has been unprecedented. People in south India have seen govts of only Congress or regional parties. They have seen how these parties have perpetuated only corruption, nepotism, misgovernance, divisiveness, vote-bank politics and a very regressive approach to governance. People have also seen their hate for Indian culture and heritage. As a result of these reasons, people are fed up of Congress and regional parties.On the other hand, people have seen our governance at the Centre and have also seen the impact of our welfare schemes reaching them. They see a ray of hope in BJP and are seeing BJP as a credible alternative. BJP was the single largest party in south India in 2019 and this time it will be the single largest party by a huge margin. The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will see that our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way.We have been hearing this talk in every election. People who are talking about our tally shrinking have shrunk to 50-odd seats themselves. People of Karnataka and BJP have a special relationship. The support for BJP saw a massive increase in 2019 and this time, our 10-year record of delivering strong economic growth, strong national security and strong welfare programmes will ensure NDA will win all 28 seats in Karnataka. NDA has been further strengthened by the addition of JD(S).Congress leaders are busy fighting to become CM while the state is suffering. The Congress govt has deceived the people of the state through faulty and half-baked implementation of their promises. People of Karnataka are fed up with the increasing lawlessness in the state and with the halt in progress of important infrastructure projects. They are fed up with the increasingly long power cuts and lack of water. People of Karnataka are repenting their vote to Congress in the state election. They will once again place their trust in the proven Modi guarantee.For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression for me. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is an outcome of my entire life in public service. When I speak about guarantee, it pushes me to work even harder for the people. When I attach such importance to my guarantees, naturally people also realise it. People see that whatever guarantee Modi gives, he fulfils it, no matter what the circumstances. From providing tap water connections to rations, from building houses for the poor to expressways, Modi is delivering on the guarantees made to people. There are no ifs and buts to Modi’s guarantees. For the Congress party, their promises are just a way to fool people to gain their votes. They have neither credibility nor the intention to fulfil their promises. They had given many guarantees since Independence. Look at what happened to the biggest guarantee given by their tallest leader: the one of removal of poverty in 1971. Successive Congress PMs had spoken about removing poverty but nothing happened for decades. The poor were living without basic necessities like a house, toilet, water connection. Corruption continued unabated. Countries which became independent around the same time as India marched way ahead of us in terms of their economies. India was considered as one of the ‘Fragile Five’ nations before we came to power. So, for the people, there is no comparison between Modi’s guarantees and Congress’s broken promises.Media should look at actions and not allegations. Look at what all has happened in Karnataka. Bomb blasts, brutal murder of a daughter, attack on people doing bhajan-kirtan... During bomb blasts, the state govt tried its best to mislead people. In the murder of the daughter, the media is showing how the father is going around asking for justice. He is from the Congress party, but still he is not getting justice. If this is not appeasement, what is it? It is not polarisation to show that Congress has violated the Constitution and enacted laws providing reservation on the basis of religion. Our Constitution clearly prohibits reservations based on religion but the Congress govt in Karnataka reversed the law passed by BJP to provide reservation to OBCs and gave it to Muslims, classifying all Muslims as OBC. Even the National Commission for Backward Classes, a constitutional body, criticised this as against principles of ‘social justice’.The Congress govt in Telangana has recently said that it will replicate this move. This proves that Congress wants to reduce the reservation provided to SCs, STs and OBCs across the country and give it to minorities. What else can one expect from a party whose prime minister said that minorities have the first right on resources of this country?For the longest time, govts have been driven by electoral considerations rather than national considerations. Every year, there would be some or other election taking place and the priority would always be to win the next election, even if it meant trading off the long-term interests of the people of India. It is a matter of concern for us. One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation, our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. A high-level committee, under the chairmanship of former President Ram Nath Kovind, has already submitted a report to President (Droupadi Murmu) prepared after extensive consultations with stakeholders and experts and research on implementing one nation, one poll. In our third term, one will see concrete steps being taken on the matter.Uniform Civil Code, too, is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the health of society. We cannot be a nation where one community is progressing with the support of constitutional norms while the another community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India.Raising the false bogey of discrimination is their way of diverting and distracting from their corruption and misgovernance. People of Karnataka proudly sing Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, Jaya he Karnataka Maate (Victory to you Mother Karnataka, the daughter of Mother India). Does Congress really think its move to further divide India will be accepted by the immensely patriotic people of Karnataka? Every patriotic Indian will reject this artificial and false divide that Congress is trying to create. Congress, in partnership with the Left, has left Kerala nearly bankrupt and is now seeking to do the same in Karnataka and Telangana. It has just been one year since Congress came to power in Karnataka and they have already done serious damage to its thriving economy. Debt incurred by the state govt has massively increased and their empty promises have not resulted in providing welfare to people. In fact, their misgovernance has spooked investors and led to flight of capital from Karnataka. There has been a 46% reduction in FDI and 80% reduction in funds for startups compared to last year in the state.We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat, the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see the Congress party and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. You would have seen the Yuvraj saying that we will do an X-ray. This X-ray is nothing but raiding every home. They will raid farmers to see how much land they possess. They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony.This is something we have to be very careful about, we cannot let anyone harm the country and its people, whatever reasons they may have. Our nation, the welfare of each and every one of our citizens is our first and foremost priority. Our govt doesn’t design policies to benefit a majority, we do not make policies that will benefit minorities; we make policies that benefit our nation and its 140 crore citizens without discrimination.I do not think they are solutions by any stretch of imagination. These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions. Would you work day and night if the govt will take away your money in the name of redistribution? Today, we are empowering 3 crore women to become Lakhpati Didis. Such policies will ensure that women don’t become Lakhpatis and their aspirations don’t progress. If someone has taken a Mudra loan and is progressing, his growth will be stunted. Our street vendors who are now growing due to our policies will also not be able to grow. Today, we are the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. Such policies will kill the startup revolution by our youth. This policy is a way to please their vote bank.If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier 2 and 3 cities, which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax etc have never been successful: they never removed poverty, they just distributed it so that everyone is equally poor. The poor remain stricken with poverty, wealth creation stops and poverty becomes uniform. These policies sow discord and block every road to equity, they create hatred and destabilise the economic as well as social fabric of a nation.Yes, Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and the prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. But you are wrong in saying there is no other emotive issue. A ‘mahila’ getting a tap water connection, LPG connection, toilet and becoming a Lakhpati Didi and having the power to dream of a better future is an emotive moment for her and her entire family. For a youth who wants to start his own business and provide for his family and has aspirations to further expand his operations, getting a collateral-free Mudra loan is also a big emotive moment. A ‘kisan’ getting his ‘samman’, a father being able to provide the best treatment to his child due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a street vendor opening a second cart due to PM-SVANidhi and transacting entirely on UPI: all these mark emotive moments for the entire country. Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. For a large number of people of this country, they are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them.As far as Kashi and Mathura are concerned, I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to developing our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces and cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-class destinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not only help the pilgrims but also the local economy.If you look at our manifesto this time closely, you will observe that we have not only expanded our schemes but have also reinvented them as per the current aspirations of the poor. Take Mudra Yojana for example. We brought around an entrepreneurship revolution through this scheme and now we will double the loan amount to match the aspirations and requirements of our entrepreneurs. Take electricity for example. We ensured electricity reaches more than 3 crore households and 18,000 villages for the first time. Now we have come up with the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana to ensure that people get free electricity. Take startups for example. We brought proactive policies and ensured that startups get all support. Now we want to make India a startup hub.So, you can see that there is continuity because we don’t want to change our direction when we are successful. But we are reimagining the scale and scope of schemes. The poor who are exiting poverty should not lapse into poverty again. The progress achieved should continue. This approach will ensure that people’s aspirations are also fulfilled and also help achieve a Viksit Bharat. Our manifesto has only things which are achievable. We don’t believe in making false and unrealistic promises that cannot be delivered.I think our Supreme Court has given a good closure to this issue. The Supreme Court judgment speaks in detail about the importance of EVMs and the transparency they bring. The opposition always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is only possible through paper ballots. I don’t think the members of INDI Alliance have ever been bothered about logic and reason when it comes to EVMs. For them, EVMs have always been the convenient scapegoat after defeat. Let us see if it will be any different this time.This is an example of the scorched earth policy that our opposition is following. Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about our people, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. Just because he has to fight elections and the people of India are not impressed by him doesn’t make India less democratic. I don’t think there are many takers for such charges in foreign capitals. They often are more in sync with reality than the ‘certificate shops’ in their countries. When I engage with world leaders, I see genuine admiration for our democratic process and our institutions. When they deep dive into the scale and speed of our electoral process, they are awed by our efficiency.It is my request to the media to first do research on these allegations. Instead of introspecting why its functionaries are leaving in hordes, Congress is making such excuses. There are many politicians with no ED or CBI cases against them who have left Congress and joined us. The fact is that just a small fraction of the agencies’ cases is related to political figures. Of the corruption cases probed by the ED, only 3% involve politicians. The remaining 97% are linked to officials and criminals. Action is being taken against them too. Over the last 11 years, out of 10,622 preliminary inquiries and regular cases being investigated by the CBI, only about 1-1.5% of the total cases involved politicians. This debunks the claim of a politically-motivated modus operandi. Another interesting fact is that before 2014, the ED attached assets worth only Rs 5,000 crore, whereas in the last 10 years that amount has increased to more than Rs 1 lakh crore.Most importantly, no ongoing investigation has been closed simply because the person involved has joined a particular party. Corruption is a serious problem, and we’re dealing with it seriously. We have come a long way in our battle against corruption in the last 10 years and are now at an inflection point. Investigations by our central agencies also extend to high-profile bureaucrats, resulting in the identification and attachment of proceeds worth over Rs 16,000 crore. These numbers show the agencies’ commitment to being fair and effective in tackling economic offences.I think it is the media’s responsibility to show the people the full perspective on this issue, how people of Delhi are suffering, and what the courts have said about the case. I am optimistic that this will not become a precedent. I feel other politicians won’t be so lacking in morals and will not go to this extent.Congress party, which converted Raj Bhavans into Congress Bhavans, has no right to speak about the sanctity of the governor’s post. Before I took on the role of prime minister, I was chief minister of a state for more than a decade. In those years, I worked under Congress governors. I respected them and they respected me, despite our differences, and this was the case for many years. Perhaps for the first time since India’s Independence, we’re seeing this level of unprecedented attacks on our governors in various states. We must understand that the governor acts as a bridge between the Union and state govt, bringing in much-needed balance in administration to an otherwise diverse and vast nation. It is very unfortunate that in certain states, we are hearing about workers of political parties stopping the governor’s convoy, and in some states, even throwing petrol bombs at the Raj Bhavan. This kind of behaviour is alarming and unacceptable. When such incidents happen, they raise serious concerns about the overall law and order situation in the state. It indicates a breakdown of authority and respect for the rule of law.As far as Raj Bhavan’s interference in state affairs goes, we need to take a look at history. Which party and people in power misused Article 356 the most to paralyse state machineries that they disagreed with? Which prime minister used Article 356 fifty times to topple elected govts led by opposition parties? And this begs the question: How many elected state govts have been toppled unethically since 2014? None. Instead, there has been a rise in cooperative federalism, with efforts to foster better relations between the Centre and states. The governor represents the constitutional authority of the state, and their position should be respected by all parties, regardless of political differences.Our efforts have been to expand the spectrum of opportunities for the youth, be it public sector, private sector or entrepreneurship. Our 10 years will be remembered for creating the maximum number of opportunities across all three segments. Rather than argue that one kind of job is better or another, we have focused on improving the overall pool of opportunities available for the youth. The results are visible. The annual Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows us that between 2017 and 2023, the labour force participation rate has increased from 49.8% to 57.9%. The unemployment rate has gone down from 6% to 3.2%. Between 2017 and 2024, over 7 crore new EPFO subscribers have been added. Over 8 crore new businesses have been started with Mudra alone and each business has supported 1-2 people. This means more than 15 crore opportunities have been created. Now add to this Startup India, Stand-up India loans and SVANidhi loans, the entrepreneurial sector itself has completely transformed. We have opened several new avenues for the youth. Space sector, which was not even thought about some years ago, is flourishing today.Our gig economy is thriving and employs lakhs of people, with over 20% engaged in highly skilled jobs. Our digital economy is also growing exponentially with over 6 crore jobs generated till 2019; a number that may double in the next few years. A recent report has said that in the past decade, the real estate sector has seen the creation of over 3 crore new jobs. I regularly attend Rozgar Melas which is the largest-ever drive to give govt jobs where we have given recruitment letters to lakhs of youth.India becoming Viksit Bharat is not Modi’s vision. It is the vision and will of 140 crore Indians that when the nation celebrates the 100th year of Independence, it should be a developed nation. I find myself extremely fortunate that I have been an instrument to realise the dreams and aspirations of my countrymen. The speed and scale of our work reflects our eagerness to take the nation to new heights. Our model of saturation shows our commitment to open the doors of prosperity for every family. Our push towards technology and newer opportunities is ensuring that our yuva shakti reaches its full potential. Our borders today are more secure than ever, our nari shakti is the one leading social change, our infrastructure is acquiring global standards and our economy is turning more and more aatmanirbhar. In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. Let me assure you, Modi is blessed by 140 crore Indians. He will not stop till the dream of Viksit Bharat is achieved.Shouldn’t the goal of our foreign policy be to advance our national interest? Our approach to foreign policy is ‘nation first’. And when we talk about our rise through a ‘nation first’ approach, it doesn’t threaten the world. The world feels the rise of India is good for the world. The world only respects those who stand for themselves. No one respects those who cannot even stand for their national interest. So when we conducted our foreign policy as per our national interest, initially it would have come as a surprise to many. For example, when we went into trade deal discussions looking at our interests in mind, our partners and even the media were surprised to see us doing so. Our partners have realised that it is normal for nations to stand for their national interest. Doing so, in fact, increased their respect for India. They came to terms with a new reality where India is very cognisant of what is good for its people and what is not. Today, the world respects India for being able to ensure that fuel and energy prices for its citizens stayed in control despite the global conflicts.Whenever I meet world leaders, I see that their interest and attraction for India is increasing. They see the situation in their countries and compare it with how India is a nation brimming with optimism and opportunities. I see genuine respect for India and Indians. Yes, the world is today filled with conflicts and chaos, but there are islands of calm and growth like India. India’s role is more important in the world than ever before.To be honest, I do not know about these records. It is your work to analyse such trends. I just keep doing my work. But since you have asked this question, I would urge you to do an analysis of this. You could look at the political landscape at that time, the opposition parties and their leaders. You could look at the level of awareness among people for their rights as well as their education levels. You can look at the media presence. An analysis should be done comparing how the country progressed in Nehru ji’s 10 years versus our 10 years. We are at a very important juncture as the country is preparing a roadmap for the next 25 years and it would enlighten the public.","PM Narendra Modi took time off from his hyperkinetic electoral campaign to speak on a range of hot-button topics.

Pannun is one of the main leaders of the Khalistan movement and the legal advisor and spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which aims to promote the idea of a separate Sikh state.The Indian government has declared Pannun a terrorist.In an investigative report, The Washington Post newspaper said, ""That India would pursue lethal operations in North America has stunned Western security officials.""""Yadav's identity and affiliation, which have not previously been reported, provide the most explicit evidence to date that the assassination plan - ultimately thwarted by US authorities - was directed from within the Indian spy service,"" the daily reported.""Higher-ranking (Research and Analysis Wing) RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) Modi's inner circle,"" it said.The top American daily -- which is now owned by American billionaire Jeff Bezos, founder and head of Amazon -- said it is investigating a global surge in such campaigns of cross-border repression, as well as the global forces leading India and other nations to employ tactics normally associated with the world's most repressive governments.For this story, Post reporters conducted dozens of interviews with officials, experts and targeted individuals in New Delhi, Washington, Ottawa, London, Prague and Berlin, it said.""In reports that have been closely held within the American government, US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel,"" the daily claimed.""That finding is consistent with accounts provided to The Washington Post by former senior Indian security officials who had knowledge of the operation and said Goel was under extreme pressure to eliminate the alleged threat of Sikh extremists overseas.""US spy agencies have more tentatively assessed that Modi's national security adviser, Ajit Doval, was probably aware of RAW's plans to kill Sikh activists, but officials emphasised that no smoking gun proof has emerged,"" it said.Quoting officials, The Washington Post said, the foiled assassination was part of an escalating campaign of aggression by RAW against the Indian diaspora in Asia, Europe and North America.The alleged plot to kill Pannun in the US coincided with the June 18 fatal shooting of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey in Canada's British Columbia province in June last year. That operation was also linked to Yadav, according to Western officials.Both plots took place amid a wave of violence in Pakistan, where at least 11 Sikh or Kashmiri separatists living in exile and labelled terrorists by the Modi government have been killed over the past two years, the report said.Senior Indian government officials named in the Washington Post report did not respond to it seeking comment, the daily said.However, when asked about the investigation into the allegations made by the US in the Pannun case, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last week, ""We have set up a high-level committee. The committee is looking into information that was shared by the American side with us, because they also equally impact our national security.""The high-level committee is looking into those aspects and that is where it is right now, Jaiswal said in New Delhi on April 25.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on April 1 had said that India's national security interests are involved in its investigation into the alleged involvement of a government official in the assassination plot aimed at Khalistani extremist Pannun.The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration has refrained from making charges against Yadav.""Charging decisions are the prerogative of law enforcement alone,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told The Washington Post, ""and the Biden NSC has rigorously respected that independence.""""The only US charges made public to date are against an alleged middleman, Nikhil Gupta, who is described in the indictment as an Indian drug and weapons trafficker enlisted to hire a contract killer. Gupta, an Indian national who has denied the charges, was arrested in Prague on June 30 and remains in prison. He is awaiting a Czech court ruling on a US request for his extradition,"" the Post reported.","A RAW official identified as Vikram Yadav was involved in the assassination plot of Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US.

He used the word “cobra” to drive home his claim that Modi holds grudges and would make farmers pay for compelling him to retract the three contentious farm laws and for apologising to them.When Delhi Police arrived in Hyderabad, the TPCC president was away, campaigning in Sedam, in Karnataka’s Gulbarga Lok Sabha constituency, along with AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. “I just received information from Telangana Congress office (Gandhi Bhavan) in Hyderabad that Delhi Police came to arrest me.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a contentious issue — why provisions of the secular Indian Succession Act (ISA) do not apply to a non-believer Muslim who wants to divide his property equitably among his children by discarding Muslim Personal (Shariat) Application Act’s succession provision that privileges sons.As a Muslim woman narrated the pitiable state she and her father, both non-believers in Islam, found themselves in regarding the division of property, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud changed tack from “we can’t give a declaration that a non-believer Muslim would be governed by ISA” and said the petition had raised an important issue for adjudication by the SC.“How can a secular law not apply to Muslims?” the bench asked and posted the matter for further hearing in the second week of July. The bench issued notice to the Union govt and requested attorney general R Venkataramani to depute a law officer to assist the court.The woman said she had a brother who was afflicted with Down Syndrome and she and her father, a widower, took care of him. She said as per Shariat, daughter gets just half the share of what sons are entitled to as successors of their father, which in this case meant the son would receive two-thirds of her father’s property and she would get one-third.Her counsel Prashant Padmanabhan argued that if “something happened to the son”, then his share would not go to her or her daughter, but to some relative of her father. “There is no authority where my father can go and say that he is a non-believer Muslim and that he would like to give effect to anequitable succession through the secular ISA,” he said.After reading Section 3 of the Shariat law, the bench said if the father does not make a declaration that he is a Muslim, he could escape the rigours of Muslim personal law. But the CJI-led bench then looked at Section 58 of the ISA, which provides that “testamentary succession (wills) to the property of any Muhammadan” will not be covered by this legislation.",Supreme Court to examine why provisions of the secular Indian Succession Act (ISA) do not apply to a non-believer Muslim who wants to divide his property equitably among his children.

This presupposition is completely unjustified. It is not permissible for this court to direct EC to take a particular view on the petitioner complaint or any other complaint for that matter and issue peremptory directions as sought by the petitioner,” the court noted.It underlined that EC is obliged to take an independent view on the complaint of the petitioner and if he is aggrieved by it, he is free to take the recourse of appropriate remedy available under the law. During the hearing, advocate Sidhant Kumar, representing EC, said the commission is receiving complaints every day and is processing these. Similarly, appropriate orders will be passed on the current plea.

Modi said he had never wanted to revoke reservations.

SOLAPUR: The responsibility of dispensing social justice to oppressed and backward sections is “atonement for the sins our ancestors may have committed”, PM Modi said Monday in a retort to the opposition’s allegation that BJP aims to do away with reservation over the long term.“Check my record over the last five years. I have the numbers (in Parliament) on my side.But I never wanted to walk that path (revoking reservation),” the PM said in western Maharashtra’s reserved constituency of Solapur, where BJP’s Ram Satpute is taking on Praniti Shinde, daughter of Congress veteran and former Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde.“Forget me, even Babasaheb Ambedkar (had he been alive) wouldn’t be able to scrap reservation in India. I am committed to upholding that policy for all oppressed classes, SCs, STs and OBCs.”Modi, who had famously spoken about the new generation having to right the wrongs of previous generations while referring to social justice during a December 2015 speech in Parliament, said the only thing he would always oppose was reservation on religious lines, as envisioned by Congress.At Satara, his next campaign stops in the region, the PM said he could give in writing that Congress’s attempt to expand nationwide the “Karnataka model” of granting reservation to all Muslims through the OBC quota would fail. “Till Modi is alive, he won’t allow such a reservation policy.”Citing schemes undertaken by the NDA govt for the uplift of Dalits and other backward communities, he said over 25 crore such people had come out of poverty in the past decade.“Neeyat sahi hai to natije bhi sahi milte hai (an honest motive will yield a positive result),” the PM added.","PM Modi said he had never wanted to revoke reservations.

In response to an RTI application seeking the status of the amendment, the ministry responded last month that the matter was still “pending”.The committee that drafted the amendment bill had recommended the DMR(OA) (Amendment) Bill 2020 “in order to giving the sharper teeth (sic) and to keep pace with the changing time and technology”.The main changes proposed were to enhance punishment and to increase the number of conditions for which ads for drugs claiming to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent would be prohibited from 54 to 78. The penalty was to increase from “imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine, or with both” for first conviction to “imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine up to ten lakh rupees”. For subsequent convictions, penalty under DMRA is “imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both”. The amendment proposed to increase it to imprisonment up to five years and fine up to fifty lakh rupees.The health ministry had constituted the committee through an order dated December 10, 2019. It included representatives from Ayush ministry , consumer affairs department, information and broadcasting ministry and a few state drug controllers. The draft amendment bill was made public for comments on February 3, 2020, just when Covid struck.All comments received were compiled by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) and sent it to the ministry by the end of June 2020. A draft cabinet note was put up before the health minister in November 2020 and a slide presentation on the draft was made by the CDSCO on the request of the ministry. The next month, it was suggested that the draft be circulated among all states as they would be the ones to implement it. The file circulated some more till Covid put a stop to it.It was next picked up in September 2022 when it was decided that a meeting ought to be held with the drug controller general of India on the matter. From the RTI reply recently, it appears that there has been no progress after that.The DMRA amendment was initiated on the recommendation of a Parliamentary standing committee, whose report tabled in March 2018 stated that “it is the need of the hour to strictly monitor and regulate the misleading advertisements for promoting the sale of AYUSH medicine”.Unlike the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, DMRA brings within its ambit medicines of all systems including Ayurvedic drugs. This is why many of the complaints against Patanjali’s drugs were filed under DMRA as they claimed to cure/treat diseases listed under the DMRA. “Despite the parliament committee’s recommendation to enact a strong law to prevent misleading and illegal ads, it is clear from the file noting that I obtained through RTI, that there is no file movement since 2022. I complained to the Prime Minister’s office and even after direction from the PMO, they are sitting on it,” said Dr Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who has filed several complaints against Patanjali ads for violating DMRA.","Amendments to strengthen the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 have been in limbo with the Union health ministry since February 2020.
