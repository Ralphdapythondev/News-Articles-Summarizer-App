Further directions have also been sought to facilitate him in several other activities, including getting his latest photograph taken and opening a new bank account, to ensure he completes all formalities regarding contesting the election.",Punjab government says it has facilitated radical Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh in filing his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha seat from the Khadoor Sahib parliamentary seat in Punjab.

Pydhonie jeweller held in abetment to suicide and cheating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pydhonie-jeweller-held-in-abetment-to-suicide-and-cheating/articleshow/110024922.cms,"MUMBAI: The city police made the first arrest in the abetment to suicide of a 30 year old tea stall owner who ended his life after fraudsters on the pretext of helping him mortage his property sold the property and used documents to avail loans for themselves. The deceased left a suicide note naming all the six persons.The police on Thursday arrested 50-year old Pydhonie based jeweller Sahdev Karmakar who had shut his shop and was on the run for some time.Police are now looking for Karmakar's five accomplices in the crime namely Raguvendra Pujari, Piyush Shah, Mahroof Inamdar, Hemant Sawant, and Urvil Shah.On June 11, last year, tea stall owner Tejas Mahatre a resident of Prabhadevi in Dadar committed suicide by hanging. The Dadar police initially registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) however later his sister Jyotsna Autavkar lodged a complaint alleging that a few days prior to the suicide her brother Tejas was in depression. She said her brother Tejas Mhatre lived in Gharkul Co-operative Housing Society of Prabhadevi. Due to the ill health of Mhatre's mother, Tejas had incurred a debt of Rs 6 to 7 lakh for her treatment. Tejas told his sister that he was unable to pay the heavy interest rate and hence he wanted to mortgage his house and take a lesser interest loan. ``29 year old Tejas approached a few agents namely Raguvendra Pujari, Piyush Shah, Sahdev Karmakar, Mahroof Inamdar, Hemant Sawant, and Urvil Shah to seek a loan of Rs 25 lakhs.'' said an officer.These people took Tejas's property papers and took Tejas and his brother Tushar to the registrar's office, also taking the signatures of both of them. The accused had also taken all the documents of Tejas's house to mortgage it. On June 10 when the bankers came to his house to recover the EMI, Tejas was shocked when they informed him that he had taken a loan of Rs 73 lakhs. Next day he committed suicide by hanging. During the course of investigations it has now come to light that out of Rs 73 lakhs received from the bank, Rs 36.50 lakh was transferred into the accounts of Mahroof Inamdar and Sahdev Karmakar, while Rs 25 lakh has gone to Ragvendra Pujari and Piyush Shah.Jyotsna Otkar, told the police that Tejas had talked about taking a loan by mortgaging the house, but these people took advantage of Tejas's ignorance and not only sold his house but also took a loan on it.When the accused stopped paying the EMI after taking the loan, the bank employees started calling Tejas and visited his house to collect the money. Next day Tejas committed suicide. To establish that deceased committed suicide after being cheated, police recorded statements of various witnesses including Tejas's brother Tushar and sister Jyotsna, the mobile Call Detail reports of the deceased and accused, bank statements, loan documents and inquest panchnama.An official said that during the investigation it transpired that the same gang of accused had been arrested by the MHB colony police and Vile Parle police for similar cheatings.","The police on Thursday arrested 50-year old Pydhonie based jeweller Sahdev Karmakar who had shut his shop and was on the run for some time.

Will mythological Misrikh see saffron surge once again?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-mythological-misrikh-see-saffron-surge-once-again/articleshow/110024903.cms,"A mixed bag for saffron

Poll dynamics

Situated around 100km away from Lucknow, Misrikh-Neemsar is a land steeped in mythology where the pantheon of 33 Hindu gods and goddesses reside.Just like Kashi, Mathura, and Ayodhya, Neemsar (or Naimish Dham) draws huge crowds throughout the year and provides employment to thousands of people.The Misrikh Lok Sabha constituency, which is among the most backward, is going to polls in the fourth phase on May 13.A part of Sitapur district, Misrikh comprises five assembly constituencies out of which three are in Hardoi (Sandila, Balamau and Bilgram-Mallawan), one in Kanpur (Bilhaur) and the fifth, Misrikh in Sitapur.The campaign pitch is getting shriller in the religious town as candidates are going all out to woo voters.In a direct battle, sitting BJP MP Ashok Kumar Rawat (49) will take on SP contender Sangita Rajvanshi. A three-term MP (twice with BSP), Rawat has the backing of the saffron symbol, presence in local events and support from various caste groups.Sangita (41), daughter-in-law of former minister, three-time MLA and Samajwadi Party veteran Rampal Rajvanshi, is banking on the support of Muslims who play a crucial role in the constituency, besides the support of fellow community members and Dalits.A reserved seat, Misrikh has about 30% SC voters. Both Rawat and Rajvanshi come from Pasi (Paswan) community and are reaching out to both Jatavs and non-Jatavs to stand behind them instead of BSP. BSP candidate BR Ahirwar (61) is dubbed as an outsider (since he is from Kanpur) and would try to consolidate the cadre vote. Interestingly, before switching over to the saffron camp, Rawat has twice been elected as BSP candidate from Misrikh in 2004 and 2009. During the 2022 assembly elections , BJP won all the five seats while BSP could not finish second in any of the five constituencies.Though BJP still enjoys considerable support, unlike previous elections, it might not be a cakewalk for the saffron party as voters give a mixed reaction on the party’s prospects.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ’s rally on Tuesday had some impact on voters. Local traders in Neemsar said that the number of tourists and business opportunities had increased ever since Ram temple was opened in Ayodhya. A lot of families from other states coming to Ayodhya have been visiting Neemsar as well.“The BJP govt has shown strong commitment for religious tourism. The makeover of Ayodhya and Mirzapur (Vindhyavasini corridor) under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s watch has been witnessed by everybody. Yogi has been saying that the focus would now be on Neemsar,” said Shiv Prakash Mishra (56) from Chawan, a village dominated by upper caste.Yogi’s assurance to provide four-lane connectivity, helicopter service, electric bus service and makeover of Lalita Mata Mandir, which has a lot of scope for religious tourism, rings a bell with lower caste members as well.However, there are a few issues which have left voters apprehensive.“We have been hearing that if BJP comes to power, it will snatch away reservation which is being provided to Dalits. I do not know BJP’s intention as it has not clearly said what it would do after forming the govt again. A sense of insecurity is palpable among ‘bahujans’,” said Baijnath Raidas from Amkherwa village who works as a help in a mango orchard. “Finding a farm labourer is getting increasingly difficult with time and the ones who get ready to work during harvest are demanding Rs 300- 400 a day. This reflects growing inflation. It will not be easy for BJP this time,” said Kalicharaj Rajvanshi from Kohrava village.Anun Kumar Maurya (25) of Ambkerwa village near Naimish Dham is disappointed over cancellation of police recruitment drive due to paper leak. “A limited number of jobs are available for youths. If 80 out of 100 youths do not find jobs, they will always complain about unemployment. We have enough to survive in the village but our expenses would go up substantially if we move to a city,” said Maurya.Though any wave in favour of Narendra Modi is not evident, the rural population of Misrikh is not unhappy with the present dispensation either.Supporters of Sangita have been unable to corner Rawat over local issues and are instead confident that voters in Machhrehta (Rajvanshi family is from the same place) and other Muslim dominated pockets within Sandila, Bilgram and Mallawan would vote en masse for Akhilesh Yadav.The party office in Misrikh is abuzz with activity. Gearing up for the day’s schedule, Mohd Yusuf (65) from Nibha village in Gondlamau block, draped in saffron ‘gamchha’ and BJP party cap over his head, was ready to get on the convoy of motor vehicles. “I have been associated with the local MLA for the last 15 years. I have a lot of expectations from BJP. I do not own any land and need financial assistance to sustain myself,” said Yusuf, adding he would convince minority voters to look at the bigger picture. Barely 300 metres away, workers of Samajwadi Party were getting their motor vehicles refuelled at a gas station before starting the day’s campaign. Ranjeet, a youth at the wheels of an SUV, said: “Quality of water being drawn through hand pumps is deteriorating. Condition of roads has worsened in the last five years.”One of the common grouses in the local community was the absence of industry and economic activity.","The Misrikh Lok Sabha constituency, which is among the most backward, is going to polls in the fourth phase on May 13.

‘Poll fight will be between son of Sonia Gandhi & Rae Bareli ka beta’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poll-fight-will-be-between-son-of-sonia-gandhi-rae-bareli-ka-beta/articleshow/110024378.cms,"A minister in the Yogi Adityanath govt and BJP candidate against Congress’s Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli constituency, Dinesh Singh, claims that the Gandhis have no right to seek support citing good deeds of their ancestors. In conversation with Shailvee Sharda, he says that Rae Bareli is no longer a Congress bastion as people have aligned themselves with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Excerpts

You are a challenger to Rahul Gandhi, the face of India’s opposition in this election . How do you see your candidature?

Why is the opposition meaningless to you?

You also defy the notion that the Gandhi family has a legacy in Rae Bareli. Why?

What is your main argument to the voters?

What edge do you have over Congress party’s pitch?

Priyanka Gandhi is camping here for Rahul’s campaign. How much do you see that translating into votes?

Why do you keep mentioning Rahul’s grandfather in your statements?

MLA Aditi Singh was not seen in your nomination. Is there any infighting?

I have already thanked my party for showing faith in me in this crucial battle. I am a committed sepoy of the BJP and will take on the overrated opposition with all my might. On this seat, I don’t see them as an opposition at all.Sonia Gandhi is not the true representative of the people of Rae Bareli. She has barely faced any opposition in elections.In 2019 too, she was technically a candidate of four parties – Congress, SP, Apna Dal (Krishna Patel group) and BSP. Though Congress may have won the seat, that was far from being a moral victory. She did not even bother to come and collect her certificate.I am not denying their connection with Rae Bareli. There was a time when Rahul’s grandfather (Feroze Gandhi) and his grandmother Indira Gandhi made Rae Bareli their home. But then, there were years when people of Rae Bareli chose others. Things change and if one cannot accept that, one becomes redundant. As far as political presence is concerned, the Congress doesn’t have an MLA, MLC, block pramukh, pradhan or a single elected representative. What legacy are they claiming?I am the son of this soil. I am available to people unlike Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. Sonia did not come to Rae Bareli even once in five years even in time of crisis like Covid-19 pandemic or a railway accident, but when her son was to file the papers, she braved the sun for hours. But I am here for anyone in need. So, this election will be ‘Sonia ka beta’ versus ‘Rae Bareli ka beta’.Development. The work done by the double engine govt will speak for itself. Four-lane highways connect Rae Bareli with Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Kanpur. It is being linked to Ganga Expressway. The railway station has been redeveloped with entry and exit on two sides. AIIMS finally got functional. The kind of development that Modiji has brought for Rae Bareli is way more than what Sonia Gandhi could bring even as ‘super PM’.Her presence is a non-issue to us and people of Rae Bareli. She attracts media but has little impact. In 2022 assembly polls too, she stayed here and asked for votes in every nook and corner. She could gather barely 16,000.He was the first MP from Rae Bareli in independent India. And another fact is that ‘jo apne baba ka nahi hua woh Rae Bareli ka kya hoga’. They are in the habit of calling a place their home and then forgetting it. They called Amethi their family but forgot it. They say Wayanad is family, they would forget it too. They also say Rae Bareli is their family. In Indian culture, you can’t change family like clothes.Her absence from my nomination doesn’t mean that she is against me or not with the Congress. She is my sister and was unwell that day. She also called me up to tell me that she was available for party as and when required.","Dinesh Singh is a minister in the Yogi Adityanath govt and BJP candidate against Congress’s Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli constituency.

‘We are more religious than BJP but don’t mix faith with politics’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-more-religious-than-bjp-but-dont-mix-faith-with-politics/articleshow/110024699.cms,"Congress-backed SP candidate and former MP Annu Tandon claims that the opposition parties are more religious than BJP, but they do not mix religion with politics . Talking to Pankaj Shah amid her hectic campaign, she says that the SP-Congress ‘gathbandhan’ was a formidable alliance which the BJP will have to reckon with this time. She maintains that SP is certainly surging ahead because of the mass base that it has cultivated over the years. Excerpts:

Samajwadi Party has been emerging as a potent rival of the BJP. Is it really posing any challenge?

Yes. The party has a huge mass base because of party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav who earned the sobriquet of ‘dhartiputra’ (son of the soil). And that he was. Now, his son and party president Akhilesh Yadav is following in his father’s footsteps by not only taking forward the party’s ideology but also doing what needs to be done.

He is not only educated and progressive but also down to earth.

What about the Congress which you represented as an MP from Unnao in 2009? The party is now your alliance partner.

Congress has lost a lot of ground over the last few years, especially in UP. That could have been because of the lack of management or control over the party. Another factor is that it is a very old party. The older generation which was once highly motivated seems to have been sidelined and the younger generation does not have that enthusiasm, ideological bent and attachment towards the party.

Was prompted you to leave the Congress which you represented as an MP from Unnao?

I was not able to help my people the way I wanted to. Congress was not able to fight.

Don’t you think that BJP’s organisational strength and popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath is overshadowing opposition?

What happened in 2014 and thereafter was not because of BJP’s strength but because of just one person who was pitched as someone who would destroy the Congress and bring about a complete political revolution uprooting corruption. BJP made statements which were baseless. But now their claims are exposed. People have started understanding the BJP’s ploy.

The opposition has been accusing the BJP of using religion as a political tool. Your views.

We are not against religion. We are very religious. But for us, religion and looking after the people are different things. In India, people are primarily gullible and God-fearing. The issue of ‘aastha’ (faith) is something which is very big. Using religion as a political tool is unfortunate. People are poor and desperate and when someone says there will be a magic and ‘Ram Rajya’ would usher in, people fall in the trap.

Is BJP politically smarter than opposition?

That is not smartness. It is devious. It is like using the name of God to achieve your political goal. I know what people want. Hindu want a ‘mandir’, Muslims want a ‘masjid’, Christians want churches. Besides that, people also want employment and growth. But the BJP is trying to satisfy the people with just 5kg of ration. Actually, 80 crore people getting free ration sends a very bad message to the world.

Why should people look for a change this time?

Farmers are in a bad condition.

They are not getting adequate prices for their produce. The problem of stray animals is another issue which has been squarely left out. They say there are ‘gaushalas’ but they are there just for the sake of it. Education and employment are also important. There are no jobs in govt or private sector.","Annu Tandon says the opposition parties are more religious than BJP. But they do not mix religion with politics, she says.

"In Teni’s Kheri, farmers’ killings a closed chapter for many",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-tenis-kheri-farmers-killings-a-closed-chapter-for-many/articleshow/110024476.cms,"LAKHIMPUR KHERI

:

The blood that was spilled in Tikunia village on Oct 3 three years ago is like the spot on Lady Macbeth’s hand. Some swear they see it even today, others don’t.It was here, a little distance away from the Kaudiyala Sahib gurdwara, on the T-point just in front of a power sub-station’s billing counter, that four protesting farmers and a local journalist were felled when a vehicle owned by junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ — and allegedly driven by his son Ashish — ploughed through them.In quick retaliation, three members of the convoy – two BJP workers and a driver – were killed by the villagers.Echoes of that violent afternoon are still heard in Lakhimpur Kheri as Mishra seeks re-election for the third time, having won convincingly from the seat twice – in 2014 and 2019. As one travels onward from Shahjahanpur, passing by a belt in the Terai considered so fertile that old timers say you can water a stone and it will sprout leaves, talk about the polls is invariably punctuated by references to the tragedy in Tikunia. It’s al ways “that incident” addressed variously by locals as “woh hadsa…kand…durghatna”.Sitting by a field in Palia where stubble is being burnt for a quick “satha dhaan” — literally a paddy crop grown in 60 days after farmers sandwich it between harvests of sugarcane and wheat, a practice banned in some states because of the enormous quantities of water that must be used — Prabhjot Singh says he won’t vote this time. “It’s pointless,” he said. “Teni is likely to win again.”Almost 40km beyond Palia, there is a line of fragile, tottery shacks on the mouth of the Sharda Barrage in Dhaurahara that sell aloo tikki and chai and cold drinks in luminescent yellow and orange bottles. Jayprakash Sahu owns one of the shops. He is busy as a group of people returning from Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav’s rally have stopped for nashtapani (refreshments). “There will be floods soon. Sharda will drive us away,” he said. “Life is tough. But benefits have reached us. We won’t lie. I think Teni is ahead again though the ballot is mostly for the BJP, not the candidate.”In Lakhimpur Kheri Lok Sabha constituency, SCs and STs make up the biggest chunk, with about 25%, followed by Kurmis and Brahmins. Muslims, at roughly 14%, and Sikhs, together with Thakurs, Yadavs, Vaishyas and Kayashthas complete the other half. Up against Teni, a Brahmin, are the SP’s Utkarsh Verma and the BSP’s Anshay Kalra, a Punja bi. At a recent meeting in the district, Mayawati said this is an opportunity for the people to avenge the blight of Tikunia.But if there is anger against Teni, it will be splintered. “What can we do,” asked Kulvinder Singh, a farmer from Naurangabad village. “Chaudhary (RLD leader Jayant Singh) should not have joined the NDA. Of course, we will fight and defeat Ajay Mishra. There are a lot of people unhappy with him.”It may not be easy. Months after the happenings in Tikunia, the BJP in 2022 swept not just the assembly seat of Lakhimpur but four others in the vicinity, stamping with authority its hold in the constituency. And this was after thousands of farmers had converged — representatives coming in from 75 districts of UP and each Indian state along with a bunch of opposition leaders – for the antim ardas (last rites) of the four dead villagers and the journalist, Raman Kashyap. They had then vowed to overthrow Teni and demanded his sacking as minister.Mishra himself has been somewhat subdued in his campaign this time, as if unwilling to tempt fate. It hasn’t helped that the Supreme Court a few days ago expressed serious concern at reports that Ashish Mishra , a prime accused in the Tikunia case who’s out on bail, violated conditions to canvass for his father.Importantly, some of the BJP legislators have refused to be seen with Mishra, complaining about his “highhandedness”. An MLA in Lakhimpur Kheri, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “If people don’t vote for him despite the Modi factor, the party shouldn’t be surprised. They can’t stand his arrogance. We had given feedback about a negative wave against Teni, but the brass decided to give him another chance, maybe because of the caste factor.”Another MLA said, “I have been talking to people in my constituency and many say that they won’t support him. They love the BJP but they equally dislike Teni.”Acharya Sanjay Mishra, VHP’s prant pracharak, said, “It’s true. Barring one MLA, the rest aren’t backing Teni. But the BJP will triumph because the vote is for PM Modi and (CM) Yogi Adityanath .”Sprawling Lakhimpur Kheri, the biggest UP district in terms of size, with bountiful rivers crisscrossing it and giant forests forming a canopy over its head – is poised for a fight. In the district that borders Nepal – motorbikes from that country with their red registration plates whizz by frequently — one of those with high stakes in the battle is Pawan Kashyap, brother of the journalist who died in Tikunia.“It’s been three years since bhai (brother) passed on. Of the 208 witnesses, only five have been examined. I’ve filed petitions to fast-track the case many times in the Supreme Court. It’s hard, but I get courage from those who’ve stood behind me. There is great resistance to Teni. Let’s see.”",Ajay Mishra 'Teni' is seeking re-election for the third time in Lakhimpur Kheri. He won convincingly from the seat twice – in 2014 and 2019.

Why Lalu is both right and wrong about Muslim reservation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-lalu-is-both-right-and-wrong-about-muslim-reservation/articleshow/110020598.cms,"Lalu Prasad has intensified the

Muslim reservation

debate that was triggered by PM Modi’s allegation that

Congress

aims to slice up the OBC quota for its minority vote bank. Prasad says Muslims should get reservation but then adds a caveat. The Constitution does not endorse reservation in jobs and education along religious lines. However, some govts have interpreted its provisions to extend reservation benefits to certain Muslim communities

Inputs from Rajesh Sharma

Should Muslims get reservation in jobs and higher education in India? This question has become a subject of intense political debate after Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted Congress, accusing it of acting against “the spirit of the Constitution” by attempting to create quota for Muslims.In his recent speeches, Modi alleged that Congress tried a “pilot project” in Andhra Pradesh; the PM then went on to include the Karnataka quota row in the debate.On Tuesday (May 7), RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who has been a strong votary of reservation in jobs and higher education for those socially and economically backward, answered the question in affirmation. “Reservation to milna chahiye Musalmanon ko, poora (Muslims should get reservation),” said Prasad during the swearing-in ceremony of 11 new MLCs, including his wife and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi.The issue became a hot political debate during the ongoing Lok Sabha election after Modi told a rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk in April, “As soon as Congress formed the govt at the Centre in 2004, one of its first tasks was to reduce the SC/ST reservation in Andhra and give the quota to Muslims. Between 2004 and 2010, Congress made four attempts to introduce Muslim reservation in that state, but it could not succeed because of legal impediments and Supreme Court’s alertness.” Modi later also alleged that Congress gave a separate quota for Muslims in Karnataka along religious lines through their inclusion in the OBC list in the state. The allegations came just before Karnataka voted in the LS election on April 26.In the political back and forth between the two rival camps, RJD’s Prasad added his bit, drawing strong reactions from BJP and its allies. At a rally in Bihar’s Darbhanga, Modi said, “Shocking statement by Lalu Ji on snatching reservation from SC, ST and OBC communities in favour of petty vote-bank politics. We will never let this happen.”Finding himself in the line of fire as Modi pitted Prasad’s once core vote bank – Muslims – against the other – backward class communities – the RJD patriarch realised his remarks might confuse Hindus and boomerang on his party’s or alliance’s prospects, and sought to clarify his statement.He said, “The basis for reservation is social backwardness. Narendra Modi wants to finish reservation. Religion cannot be a basis for reservation. I am senior to Narendra Modi...”Prasad also said, “The Mandal Commission report was implemented by us [during the VP Singh govt]. No one should lecture us on it.”Earlier, Modi’s comments saw National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) chief Hansraj Ahir seeking clarification from the Karnataka chief secretary regarding the categorisation of the OBC quota and “blanket reservation” to Muslims under Category II-B.The NCBC data shows Muslims form about 13% of Karnataka’s population. The state provides 32% reservation for OBCs in jobs and higher education. A sub-category comprising 4% is reserved for Muslims in Karnataka.The story goes back to 1975Set up by the Devaraj Urs-led Congress govt, the LG Havanur-led Karnataka Backward Classes Commission presented its report in 1975, recognising Muslims as eligible for reservation. Muslims were categorised under backward communities alongside other groups like SCs and STs. Havanur was a legal luminary who shuttled in politics from Congress to BJP (his last political association, ending in 1999), and was also invited to the body framing the South African constitution in 1991.Subsequently, in March 1977, the Karnataka govt issued a directive granting reservation to backward classes, including Muslims. However, the OBC list excluded Lingayats but included Vokkaligas, leading to protests by Lingayats, who subsequently moved the court.SC backed the Havanur report’s recommendations and a Constitution bench said depravations of poverty are aggravated by the consideration of castes.The two Janata panelsTwo more backward commissions were set up by Karnataka govt during the 1980s by the Ramkrishna Hegde-led Janata Party govt. The T Venkataswamy Commission was set up in 1984. The second backward commission’s report differed from the first as it excluded both Vokkaligas and Lingayats from the backward classes category while recognising Muslims as socially and educationally backward.Vokkaligas now felt offended and enraged. Being the backbone of the political base of the Janata Party in Karnataka, the Hegde govt decided to reject the Venkataswamy Commission report.It then set up the third backward commission under Justice O Chinnappa Reddy in March 1988. The panel submitted its report to the Veerendra Patil govt of Congress in April 1990 and the report was placed before the assembly in June 1990. This commission also recognised Muslims as eligible for reservation based on backwardness.However, the report led to huge protests as it excluded the Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Catholic Christians, Ganigas and Devangas from the list of backward classes.Finally, Muslim reservationThe Reddy commission proposed placing Muslims in Category 2 of the OBC list. In 1994, the Veerappa Moily-led Congress govt decided to implement the recommendations. It announced a 6% quota in Category 2B, labelled ‘More Backward’, for Muslims, Buddhists, and SC converts to Christianity. Muslims were given a 4% reservation, while the remaining 2% was reserved for Buddhists and SC con verts to Christianity.But the govt order was challenged in court, and in September 1994 SC passed an interim order limiting overall reservation to 50%. This was also a time of huge political turmoil in Karnataka, leading to the collapse of the Moily govt in December 1994 – even before it could act on the top court’s interim order.HD Deve Gowda of Janata Dal became the Karnataka CM, and in February 1995 he implemented the new quota plan with some adjustments as per SC’s interim verdict. Muslims were given 4% reservation in educational institutions and govt jobs under the 2B quota. Interestingly, Deve Gowda is now an ally of BJP, contesting the LS election in Karnataka under PM Modi’s leadership.BJP’s attemptThis reservation scheme stayed in place with minor tweaks until the Basavraj Bommai govt of BJP proposed to revoke it in March 2023, months ahead of the Karnataka assembly election. BJP suggested the creation of two new categories 2C and 2D for Vokkaligas and Lingayats— each getting a 2% reservation in jobs and higher education. The move aimed to remove the 2B category for Muslims and in cluding them under the 10% quota for economically weaker sections.This proposal sparked fierce political opposition and a court battle, forcing the govt to shelve the proposal. In April 2023, SC also prima facie observed the Bommai govt’s decision to scrap the 4% quota for Muslims as OBC beneficiary “shaky and flawed”.The Andhra experimentIn Andhra, Muslims make up around 9.5% of the population, according to the 2011 Census. Here, specific Muslim communities like the Dudekula, Laddaf, Noorbash, and Mehtar have OBC quota benefits of up to 10%. These groups were found to be poorer and lagging behind even SCs in terms of educa tion and socio-economic conditions.This reservation falls under the BC-E category, distinct from the existing OBC quota, ensuring no overlap. However, there’s a campaign to include all Muslims in the OBC category, on the lines of Karnataka and Kerala.After the 2004 parliamentary and assembly polls, with Congress in office at the Centre and in the state, it asked the Commissionerate of Minorities Welfare to look into the “socio-economic and educational conditions of the Muslim community” in then united Andhra for their inclusion in the OBC list.Based on the Commissionerate recommendation, a 5% reservation was given to “Muslim minorities in employment, educational and other fields on par with the Backward Classes” in Andhra, fulfilling Congress’ promise in its poll manifesto. The scheme was implemented in July 2004. But it was subsequently challenged in court. A five-judge bench of Andhra Pradesh HC in Sept 2004 struck down this quota for all Muslims as unconstitutional. It said the reservation was implemented without consulting the state’s Backward Classes Commission as statutorily mandated.HC also found that the quota for Muslims did not exclude the “creamy layer”, disregarding SC’s directives in the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992. HC directed Andhra govt to reconstitute the Commission for Backward Classes and formulate its quota plan based on the panel’s recommendations.Subsequently, Andhra govt brought out an ordinance —Andhra Pradesh Reservation of Seats in the Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Public Services under the State to Muslim Community Ordinance — in 2005. It was later replaced by a law providing for 5% quota for Muslims in higher education and jobs. This was based on Backward Classes Commission’s finding that the Muslim community was “socially, educationally and economically backward” and therefore entitled to affirmative action.But the law took the total quota in the state to 51%, breaching the 50% quota ceiling fixed by SC, as existing reservations were not changed. Andhra Pradesh HC again struck down the Act for being based on “unscientific and defective criteria”.The YS Rajasekhara Reddy-led Congress state govt then promulgated another ordinance providing 4% reservation to 14 categories of poor Muslims, thereby bringing reservation under the 50% cap. This too was challenged and struck down by HC in 2010.The HC ruling was subsequently challenged in SC.In an interim order in 2010, SC directed that the quote continue till the court had heard the issue. The case was subsequently referred to a Constitution Bench. Thus, the Muslim quota law remains unaffected in Andhra. The case has not come up for hearing in SC.Do Muslims have an all-India reservation?Contrary to the popular perception, Muslims are not a homogenous group. Several Muslim communities get reservation under OBC category at the central and state levels, stemming from Article 16(4), which guarantees quota for a “backward class of citizens”. If a Muslim caste is classified as socially and economically backward, it gets reservation at central and state levels.Currently, 36 Muslim communities listed in Categories 1 and 2A are included in the central OBC list. However, families earning more than Rs 8 lakh a year are considered in the creamy layer and not considered for quota benefits. At least a dozen states and Union territories have a quota for one or more Muslim communities in some form Andhra, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and MP, to name a few.What about those who have converted to Islam?Apart from the provisions discussed above, Muslims are not entitled to reservation benefits. There have been arguments about extending the quota benefits to persons belonging to SCs if they convert to Islam or Christianity. This is currently guided by Scheduled Caste Order of 1950, amended several times over decades. The 1950 SC order says no person professing a religion different from Hinduism or Sikhism or Buddhism can be deemed an SC. However, this top court order acknowledges the presence of Dalits among Muslims.National Commission on Minorities in 2008 recommended extension of reservation benefits to Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians. A petition has been pending before SC seeking reservation benefits for converted SCs.BJP and PM Modi have spoken against granting reservation benefits to SC Muslims or SC Christians. The issue may see a closure with a top court judgment whenever it comes as the SC order of 1950 is categorical on the issue of conversion. It says, “A convert or re-convert to Hinduism and Sikhism shall be accepted as a member of Scheduled Caste if he has been received back and accepted as a member of the concerned Scheduled Caste.”","Lalu Prasad says Muslims should get reservation but then adds a caveat. The Constitution does not endorse reservation in jobs and education along religious lines. However, some govts have interpreted its provisions to extend reservation benefits to certain Muslim communities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110024226,imgsize-1766560,width-400,resizemode-4/110024226.jpg"

"Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge could create anarchic situation, claims baseless, says EC; party hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-congress-chief-mallikarjun-kharge-could-create-anarchic-situation-claims-baseless-says-ec-party-hits-back/articleshow/110019866.cms,"NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , Election Commission on Friday dismissed his allegations around voter turnout data as “baseless” and said it could create an “anarchic situation, besides doubts and disharmony”.“Through innuendos and insinuations, the contents of the post tend to create disharmony in respect of the delicate space of election management, can plant doubts in the mind of voters and political parties…” EC said.In a strongly worded rebuttal running into 21 pages, the poll panel said Kharge’s allegations in a letter to INDIA leaders and posted on social media was part of a “design in creating a false narrative” during the poll period and pointed out that no Congress candidates ever complained about the electoral roll, votes polled or filed any petition in the last three years based on any discrepancy in data. It said the charges were meant to “create confusion, misdirection and impediments in the conduct of free and fair polls”.Refuting allegations of discrepancies point by point, EC detailed the process to argue that there was no room for interference in the procedure and nothing could go unnoticed by the candidates or their representatives.It said political parties know the number of voters at every stage, with the booth-wise number available to candidates. Besides, it said, there was no scope for any deviation with the number of votes polled, which was recorded in Form 17C, and a signed copy was made available to candidates at the close of voting. Also, on the day of counting, the votes polled in the EVM were tallied with Form 17C in the presence of the candidates or their agents. It said no instance of deviation from the norms was flagged by any Congress candidate in any of the 283 seats that went to the polls in the first three phases.“A trend of irresponsible statements attacking or attempting to degrade the credibility of elections in terms of men and material by a national political party is disconcerting,” EC said, while “advising” Kharge to refrain from such comments.Responding to Kharge questioning the increase in turnout by around 5.5 percentage points in the first phase and about 5.7 percentage points in the second, and delay in publication of voter turnout data, EC said there was no delay and pointed out that the updated turnout data has always been higher than what was released on polling day. To back this, it shared the ‘factual matrix’ of figures from elections, beginning with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The commission accused Kharge of pushing a “biased narrative” under the guise of seeking clarifications and pointed to his party colleague Randeep Singh Surjewala’s attempts to spread rumours around the use of EVMs from South Africa during last year’s assembly elections in Karnataka.“The commission has come to notice a design/pattern in creating a false narrative during election period, which unfortunately appears to be continued by your letter,” it said.“As a senior parliamentarian, a very seasoned politician, with experience of 52 years in electoral politics and electoral process, and as the head of a prominent national political party, you must be aware that EC follows most transparent process of preparation of electoral roll and well designed and well tested participation of political parties/candidates at every stage of the process,” EC said.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge questioned the increase in turnout by around 5.5 percentage points in the first phase.

Terrorist Habibullah Malik, alias Sajid Jutt, is also involved, operating from Pakistan,” an official source said Thursday.CCTV footage from the area also captured three more Pakistani terrorists , whose identities are being sought by police. Sources disclosed that Pakistan is employing drones to smuggle arms and ammunition to terrorists. “Pakistani UAVs carrying weapons were shot down in Poonch and Rajouri,” revealed an official.Following the May 4 ambush near Shahsitar (between Surankote and Mendhar in Poonch) an intensive cordon-and-search operation was jointly launched by the Army, J&K Police and CRPF — equipped with aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs — to plug potential escape routes and track down the terrorists believed to be holed up in the general area of Surankote-Poonch (Shahsitar, Gursai, Sanai, Lasana, and Sheendara top in the Surankote belt and adjoining areas in Poonch district) spread over approximately 20km.Sketches of Hamza and Handoon were released while a reward of Rs 20 lakh was announced for any information on their whereabouts.

In an unusual move, the EC on Friday responded to Kharge's letter to fellow INDIA bloc leaders that was also posted on X, and rejected his allegations.Congress general secretary, Jairam Ramesh said, “EC is a Constitutional body entrusted with the responsibility of being an impartial body that ensures, and is seen to ensure, a level-playing field to all political parties.” “Both the content and intent of the letter will be a permanent blot on the reputation of an institution that can boast of luminaries like Sukumar Sen, TN Seshan, JM Lyngdoh and others,” he said adding that the approach of ECI to addressing these issues is “deeply regrettable”.Addressing the media after the INDIA bloc leaders met the EC, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that they raised two key issues, ""Issue number one was one of great trust deficit and a feeling of alarm and distress that 11 complaints by Congress alone, and more that 15 complaints by all parties put together against the Prime Minister and Home Minister, starting from early April, have not been addressed.""Singhvi said that “if they (EC) don't act promptly, it will be a complete abdication of Constitutional duty.” He also hinted that the opposition parties may approach the Supreme Court with the issue. ""It is no joy for us to go to the Supreme Court and get directions saying why don't you decide. We are distressed and there is no satisfactory answer why these people are not touched,"" he said.Singhvi said they also raised the issue of ""non-publication or publication with extreme delay of the voter turnout percentages."" The delegation raised three points - the difference of voter percentage increase is 5.74% or 5.5%. The comparable figure in the 2019 election in the first three phases was 2%, 1%, 2.5%, this time it is double.The INDIA bloc has demanded that since the “stamp of approval of a published absolute figure and a percentage figure by the EC carries its own constitutional weight” that should be provided.","Congress calls EC’s response to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ‘s letter as a “permanent blot” on the face of a body.

"In major step towards theatre commands, govt notifies tri-service Act",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-major-step-towards-theatre-commands-govt-notifies-tri-service-act/articleshow/110018311.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has finally notified the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, which will also pave the way for creation of the long-pending unified theatre commands in the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence.The enforcement with immediate effect of the ISO Act , which received presidential assent on August 15 last year after the bill was passed by Parliament during the monsoon session, comes soon after the BJP manifesto last month promised its government will “establish military theatre commands for more efficient operations” after creating the chief of defence staff ( CDS ) post in December 2019.Parallelly, CDS General Anil Chauhan chaired a “Parivartan Chintan” here on Thursday-Friday, during which 12 sub-committees made presentations on different domains and aspects towards jointness and integration “in light of the imminent theaterization”, officials said.The flurry of activity shows the stage is now being set for the creation of integrated theatre commands (ITCs), which stalled after the first CDS Gen Bipin Rawat’s death in a helicopter crash in December 2021, amid festering inter-service turf wars.India certainly needs a cost-effective war-fighting machinery through ITCs instead of the existing 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in planning, logistics and operations, and often pull in different directions.The ISO Act empowers military commanders of existing tri-service organizations with full administrative and disciplinary powers over the Army, Navy and IAF personnel serving under them, “without disturbing the unique service conditions of each individual service”. Till now, military personnel were governed by their own service acts like the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950 and the Navy Act, 1957.The ISO Act will also allow the requisite command and control of the proposed ITCs. As per the existing plan, there will be two “adversary-specific” ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur. The Maritime Theatre Command at Karwar in coastal Karnataka, in turn, will be for the Indian Ocean Region as well as the larger Indo-Pacific.The MoD on Friday said, “The Act will empower the heads of ISOs and pave the way for expeditious disposal of cases, avoid multiple proceedings and will be a step towards greater integration and jointness among armed forces personnel.”India currently has only two unified commands, the geographical Andaman and Nicobar Command and the functional Strategic Forces Command to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal, which were set up in 2001 and 2003 after the Kargil conflict with Pakistan.China, incidentally, reorganised its 2-million People’s Liberation Army into five theatre commands in early-2016 to boost offensive capabilities and establish better command-and-control structures. Its Western Theatre Command, for instance, handles the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India, in contrast, has four Army and three IAF commands for the northern borders with China.","The government has finally notified the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act. It will pave the way for creation of the long- pending unified theatre commands. India needs a cost-effective war-fighting machinery through ITCs instead of 17 single-service commands.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110018318,imgsize-43850,width-400,resizemode-4/110018318.jpg"

"'Ram is the idea of India, Congress can’t see as it uses foreign lens': PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ram-is-the-idea-of-india-congress-cant-see-as-it-uses-foreign-lens-pm-modi/articleshow/110019885.cms,"HYDERABAD: Seeking to frame the Lok Sabha polls as a duel between the two alternative visions of ‘idea of India’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday emphasised that Lord Ram is at the core of ‘my idea of India’ as “He is an embodiment of inspiration for a whole lot of values associated with the country that give it a unique identity in the world”.Responding to former Indian Overseas Congress chairperson Sam Pitroda’s recent attack on him over his visit to Ram Mandir and Ram Navami celebrations, Modi said that Congress is divorced from the “idea of India”, which encapsulates civilisational history spanning thousands of years, because the opposition party always saw the country from a foreign lens which is anti-Hindu and saw Ram Navami celebrations and building a Ram Temple in Ayodhya as antithetical to India as it is understood and subscribed to all these decades.“When a nation is all involved in Ram temple, Ram mandir, diya jalao, that bothers me… When PM is spending time in temples all the time, it bothers me,” Pitroda had argued in the interview.Modi responded to the criticism in detail while addressing a rally at LB Stadium here, emphasising that it was Lord Ram who was at the core of patriotism for the motherland. “Janani janmabhoomishch swargadapi gariyasi – I love my motherland even more than heaven,” he quoted Lord Ram as saying.In a speech that was reminiscent of his rally at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan after he was made BJP’s PM candidate in 2013, Modi said: “Idea of India is ‘justice for all, appeasement of none’; ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (world is one family)’; ‘Satyameva Jayate’; and ‘Ahimsa Paramo Dharma (non-violence is ideal religion). India means ‘Mother of democracy’. Today, idea of India is ‘International Yoga Day’, ‘Shiva Shakti point on Moon’. All this that represents the ‘idea of India’ is today not limited to mere customs but represents India’s identity and its voice in the world.”Without taking Pitroda’s name, he said: “The tutor of the shehzada (Rahul) gives him very dangerous ideas. The tutor informed him that construction of a Ram temple is against the idea of India. They even objected to me going to the Ram temple. Tell me, are we traitors to the country? Will you allow this type of disrespect to Lord Ram?”Modi dubbed Congress an ‘anti-Hindu party’ which never cared for the majority community. “Despite knowing that religion-based reservation is unconstitutional and Ambedkar did not support it, they want to bring Muslim reservations across the country like they did in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Muslim reservations will pave the way for conversions in the country. Will you allow your quota to be taken away like that?” he said.Recalling that “bomb blasts used to take place in the country during the Congress-led UPA regime”, he said such terror attacks did not take place now and appealed to elderly voters to tell first-time voters in their families about blasts such as the one in Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad.“In those days, news of blasts used to be everywhere. One family goes to a restaurant for dinner, there would be bomb blast. One family goes to watch a movie in a theatre, there would be bomb blast. Blasts happened while travelling in buses. I want to warn people that voting for Congress would mean sending the country back in the grip of terrorism. They have taken a soft stance on terrorism,” Modi said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised that Lord Ram is at the core of ‘my idea of India’ He said that Congress is divorced from the ‘idea of India, which encapsulates civilisational history spanning thousands of years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110019931,imgsize-102424,width-400,resizemode-4/110019931.jpg"

When he was suspended in 2012, various charges were slapped on him. During the inquiry, the vigilance officer found that the judge had allegedly administered electric shocks to four employees of the court in Savli. The staffers - peons Deva Bhalani, M H Joshi and P C Joshi and watchman Tanvir Meer - claimed that the judge inflicted electric shocks on them using a tubelight starter.To establish the charge of torture, the statements of the alleged victims were recorded. Alwani was also being probed by the department on 22 other charges, which were not so grave. The inquiry report was submitted to the disciplinary authority in 2014 with the finding that he was guilty of torturing the court staffers. As this conduct was unbecoming of a judicial officer, the high court imposed a major penalty on him and his services were terminated in 2016.He challenged the decision of the HC's administrative side through advocate Vaibhav Vyas, who argued that there were many charges that were not substantiated including that of torturing the court staffers. He argued that the inquiry officer relied only on the statements of witnesses and ignored the expert opinion of a deputy engineer of Madhya Gujarat Vij Co Ltd (MGVCL) which said that electric shocks cannot be administered in the way the victims were claiming. The lawyer submitted that the inquiry officer overlooked the expert opinion and wrongly held the judge guilty of such a serious charge.On behalf of the high court's administration, it was argued that the findings of the inquiry report was accepted by the committee of the high court and the committee arrived at the conclusion that the judge had committed an act ""which was unbecoming of a judicial officer and therefore recommended the punishment of dismissal from service under Rule 6(8) of the Gujarat Civil Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1971."" The HC's lawyer justified the inquiry officer's conclusion that the act of a judicial officer having behaved like an uncivilized man amounts to misconduct.After hearing the case, the bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav and Justice Nisha Thakore found the inquiry officer's conclusion faulty on the allegations of torture and quashed the charge.

A video from a purported sting in which BJP’s Sandeshkhali Block-II chief Gangadhar Koyal says the “Sandeshkhali movement” was MLA Suvendu Adhikari's brainchild is among them.There are two other videos, each showing a different “survivor” alleging she had been made to sign a blank sheet of paper, and an older clip featuring BJP's Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra telling a TV channel she suspected some of the “survivors” taken to Delhi to meet President Droupadi Murmu may have been “paid to impersonate”.TMC minister Shashi Panja said, “We will approach EC against the NCW chairperson, who coerced these women to file fake rape complaints. The BJP ecosystem started false stories for political agenda and then brought in various commissions. It is becoming clear now that these commissions were part of the conspiracy .”Sharma refuted the claims. In its letter to the poll panel, NCW alleged that TMC workers were “instilling fear in the minds of Sandeshkhali women and stopping them from coming forward with their complaints and potentially impacting the election process in the area”.The letter urges the EC to investigate the matter “on priority and direct the authorities to take appropriate measures”.“In recent developments surrounding the Sandeshkhali case, NCW has noted that a few women have suddenly taken their complaints back regarding Sheikh Shahjahan. NCW finds this turn of statement deeply concerning, particularly amid the backdrop of the general elections of 2024,” NCW said in a statement.","Four videos have emerged in the last few days, each suggesting that the rape allegations — or at least some of them — might have been concocted.

While, New Delhi has condemned any terrorist attack, including the October 7 attack by Hamas, it has also called for a homeland for Palestinians.""We have supported a negotiated two-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel,"" the Ministry of External Affairs reiterated in the Parliament in February.In his remarks before voting on Friday, Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour elaborated on the plight of Palestinians in war-torn Gaza.""As we speak, 1.4 million Palestinians in Rafah wonder if they will survive today,"" he told the assembly, referring to Israeli threats of a major attack on the densely populated city in southern Gaza, as reported by CNN.He also thanked protesters on US university campuses and abroad who have demonstrated against the Israel-Hamas war.""Our flag flies high and proud in Palestine and across the globe, and on the campus of Columbia University. It has become a symbol by all those who believe in freedom and is just ruled by all those who can no longer stand idly by in the face of such utter injustice,"" Mansour said.Israel foreign minister Israel Katz quickly condemned the resolution's passage, describing it as an ""absurd decision"" that highlights ""the structural bias of the UN"" and rewards the actions of Hamas on October 7.""The message that the UN is sending to our suffering region: violence pays off,"" he said. ""The decision to upgrade the status of Palestinians in the UN is a prize for Hamas terrorists after they committed the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.""It is pertinent to note that while a General Assembly vote cannot confer UN membership, the approved resolution does endow the Palestinian Authority with new procedural rights and privileges, CNN reported.Though, only member states can vote, the Palestinian Authority can now be seated among member states in alphabetical order, submit and introduce proposals and amendments, and co-sponsor proposals and amendments.It can also make statements and explanations of votes. It has the right to reply on behalf of a group within the UN. The Palestinian Authority can also request proposals to be put to a vote and request items to be put on the UNGA's provisional agenda.Mansour further stated that the Palestinian Authority will now request full membership from the Security Council.However, the US has already warned that it will likely veto such a request in the Security Council - a replay of its April veto of an earlier Palestinian membership request.Following the general assembly vote on Friday, US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood described the resolution text as ""unproductive,"" saying a ""durable peace"" in the Middle East would mean bundling the two-state solution with other elements, as reported by CNN.""Gaza cannot be a platform for terrorism, that there should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that the size of Gaza's territory should not be reduced,"" he said.Wood also suggested that the United Nations was the wrong forum for consideration of Palestinian statehood, telling the General Assembly that ""it remains the US view that the most expeditious path toward statehood and UN membership for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority.""","A resolution was passed in the United Nations with an overwhelming majority, supporting full membership of Palestine and pressing the Security Council to give ""favourable consideration"" to the bid.

India was also one of the first countries to recognise the State of Palestine in 1988 and in 1996, Delhi opened its Representative Office to the Palestine Authority in Gaza, which was later shifted to Ramallah in 2003.Earlier this month, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj had said that while Palestine's application for membership at the UN was not approved by the Security Council because of the veto in the UNSC, ""I would like to state here at the very outset that in keeping with India's long-standing position, we hope that this would be reconsidered in due course and that Palestine's endeavour to become a member of the United Nations will get endorsed"".An annex to the resolution said that the additional rights and privileges of participation of the State of Palestine will be effective as of the 79th session of the General Assembly that begins in September this year.These include the right to be seated among member states in alphabetical order; the right to make statements on behalf of a group, including among representatives of major groups; the right of members of the delegation of the State of Palestine to be elected as officers in the plenary and the Main Committees of the General Assembly and the right to full and effective participation in UN conferences and international conferences and meetings convened under the auspices of the General Assembly.Palestine, in its capacity as an observer state, does not have the right to vote in the General Assembly or to put forward its candidature to UN organs.In April, Palestine had sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres requesting that its application for full UN membership be considered again. For a state to be granted full UN membership, its application must be approved both by the Security Council and the General Assembly, where a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting is required for the state to be admitted as a full member.Last month, the US had vetoed a resolution in the Security Council on the Palestinian bid to be granted full membership of the United Nations. The 15-nation Council had voted on a draft resolution that would have recommended to the 193-member UN General Assembly ""that the State of Palestine be admitted to membership in the United Nations"".The resolution got 12 votes in its favour, with Switzerland and the UK abstaining and the US casting its veto. To be adopted, the draft resolution required at least nine Council members voting in its favour, with no vetoes by any of its five permanent members - China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States.Currently, Palestine is a ""non-member observer state"" at the UN, a status granted to it by the General Assembly in 2012. This status allows Palestine to participate in proceedings of the world body but it cannot vote on resolutions. The only other non-member observer state at the UN is the Holy See, representing the Vatican.","The 193-member General Assembly met in the morning for an emergency special session.

He has also told the cadres that the PM and BJP are aware that the EC will not act against them for provoking people in the name of religion and caste.Kharge has said the first three phases of voting have seen an overwhelming response for Congress, and there should be extra effort to ensure that BJP does not succeed in distracting the nation’s attention by their bid to raise communal issues in an effort to “divide the poor on religious and caste lines”.Interestingly, in the wake of repeated controversies triggered by comments from party functionaries, Kharge has urged them to be extra careful about what they speak to the press. At the same time, he has asked Congress functionaries, especially seniors, to refrain from speaking on sensitive issues, especially on national security, over which the party stand is already clear.“BJP and its handlers will go to any length to manipulate your words by taking them out of context or by editing your speeches or by manipulating them using technology,” he has said in the missive, forwarded by AICC general secretary K C Venugopal to state units, office-bearers and public representatives. The party has urged the state units to disseminate the instructions down to the grassroots level.While lamenting what he has called the EC’s indulgent attitude towards the governing camp, Kharge advised party functionaries and workers to not worry about the EC’s inaction and to aggressively take the initiative in filing cases against BJP functionaries whenever there is a violation, assuring them that law will catch up with BJP soon.“It is the poor who have suffered the most in the last 10 years due to unemployment and price rise. We should not allow ourselves to be distracted by the efforts of BJP and the PM to communalise this . BJP is now trying to divide the poor on the basis of religion and caste. I request all of you to be alert to such efforts,” Kharge wrote.","Kharge has said the first three phases of voting have seen an overwhelming response for Congress.

It said this innovative approach, known as Design for Additive Manufacturing, has yielded remarkable advantages.""The Laser Powder Bed Fusion technique employed in the manufacturing process reduced the number of engine components from 14 to a single piece, eliminating 19 weld joints.

An Assistant Minister ranked official, Xu, 60, appointed by Chinese President Xi Jinping for the sensitive job, said he regards his posting in New Delhi as an ""honourable mission and a sacred duty"" to improve and advance the bilateral ties.""It is an honourable mission and a sacred duty. I will do my best to deepen understanding and friendship between the two peoples, expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and improve and advance the bilateral relationship ,"" Xu told PTI and China's state-run CGTN-TV in a media interaction here before leaving for New Delhi to take up his posting.""China is ready to work with India to accommodate each other's concerns, find a mutually acceptable solution to specific issues through dialogue at an early date, and turn the page as soon as possible,"" Xu said without elaborating further.Xu previously served as China's Ambassador to Afghanistan and Romania, besides senior cadre-level postings in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).He succeeds veteran Chinese diplomat Sun Weidong, who completed his tenure in October 2022. He is currently China's Vice Foreign Minister.Xu's appointment comes after an unusually long delay of 18 months amid strained relations between the two countries over the Ladakh military standoff.Relations between the two countries hit a low except for trade ever since the eastern Ladakh border standoff erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong Tso (lake) area. The two sides have so far held 21 rounds of Corps Commander-level talks to resolve the standoff.India is pressing the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to disengage from the Depsang and Demchok areas, maintaining that there cannot be restoration of normalcy in its relations with China as long as the state of the borders remains abnormal.According to the Chinese military, the two sides so far agreed to disengage from four points, namely the Galwan Valley, the Pangong Lake, Hot Springs, and Jianan Daban (Gogra).As he set to take over his posting in New Delhi, Xu was candid and hopeful about resolving the present deadlock in bilateral ties.""I noted Prime Minister Modi's comments on the importance of China-India ties , and the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to that right afterwards,"" Xu said.In his recent interview with Newsweek magazine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India's relationship with China is important and significant.""The Chinese side always believes that China-India ties should not be defined by any single issue or area; the boundary question is not the entirety of the relationship. Speaking at the Indian Council of World Affairs in September 2014, President Xi Jinping said that we must not focus our attention only on differences and forget about our friendship and cooperation, still less should we allow the differences to stand in the way of our development and interfere with the overall growth of bilateral relations,"" Xu said.On how he viewed his appointment after a considerable hiatus, Xu said, ""It is my great honour to be appointed by His Excellency President Xi Jinping as the 17th Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of India"".""I look forward to, and I trust that I will have, the support and assistance from the Indian government and friends from all sectors as I work to perform my ambassadorial duties,"" he said.Xu also said cooperation and coordination between India and China on global and regional affairs would not only bring opportunities to both but also have an ""important positive impact"" on a reasonable international order.The world today is experiencing profound changes unseen in a century. ""We face multiple global challenges such as climate change, food and energy crises, weak economic recovery and so on,"" Xu said.""Closer communication and coordination on global and regional affairs will not only bring opportunities to both countries and the world but also add stability and positivity to international relations. It will have an important positive impact on the development of a fair and reasonable international order,"" he said.","China ready to work with India to ""accommodate"" each other's concerns and find a mutually acceptable solution to ""specific issues"" through dialogue. Beijing's new envoy to New Delhi Xu Feihong has said, remarks that came against the backdrop of the prolonged military standoff in eastern Ladakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110019765,imgsize-1052719,width-400,resizemode-4/110019765.jpg"
