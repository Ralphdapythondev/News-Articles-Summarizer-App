"Three decades on, Ghosi awaits heir to legacy of its development man",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-decades-on-ghosi-awaits-heir-to-legacy-of-its-development-man/articleshow/110431140.cms,"Even 25 years after his death, no candidate has dared to address the people of Ghosi Lok Sabha constituency during the ongoing campaign without remembering Kalpnath Rai – a politician who continues to be synonymous with Mau.“A four-time member of Lok Sabha and thrice of Rajya Sabha, Rai carried out development works in and around the district which continue to serve as benchmark. No other parliamentarian from Mau has been able to even match the standard till now, forget about surpassing it,” says Virendra Kumar aka Virendra Engineer, once a close associate of Rai.A Study In Contrast“In stark contrast to Rai’s contribution, barely two months after the death of five-term MLA from Mau Sadar and mafia-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari, no impact or sympathy wave is palpable in the constituency in general, and Mau Sadar assembly segment in particular. Only out of fear, backing from the members of a community and serving the interest of a few in getting contracts and other works done led to his consecutive victories,” says advocate Hari Kant Singh, replying to a query on the mantra for Mukhtar’s successive victories.Others like advocate Ashok Singh also echo similar sentiments.“It is hard to forget Kalpanath Rai ’s name when the development of Mau is discussed. It is equally hard to pin-point development works undertaken during Ansari’s five terms, barring construction of roads, drains and setting up of transformers at some places in the constituency,” a government official, listening to the conversation, chips in.The Development ManBack to Kalpanath Rai. “Around 23 power sub-stations, 28 automatic telephone exchanges, and out of the first three 400 KVA power substations, one was set up in Mau,” says Virendra Engineer. He points towards an 18-acre rose park across the Mau-Ballia Road, adding that this is one of the last works done by Rai Saheb before he died on June 4, 1999, at the age of 58.The other two 400 KVA power sub-stations were set up in Varanasi and Gorakhpur then.“Be it getting a new residence for Mau DM in five acres land, a new collectorate and court, over half-a-dozen state of the art guest houses, Indian Institute of Seed Science, Mau, and National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms, the level of development works taken up by Rai continue to remain unmatched,” Virendra says, adding that several politicians who came after the demise of Rai claimed they would take Mau to newer heights but none could. “Mau had three railway overbridges at a time when even the state capital did not have one,” says Avinish Rai, a native of Kopa in Mau district. “Rai’s vision of development was such that Mau Sadar, which was not even a tehsil until 1987, became a district in 1988,” he adds. “Politicians have been challenged by people during discussions to only get the infrastructure and buildings that Rai got constructed, whitewashed and maintained for their five-year term, which itself will be a great service to the people of Mau. Even that could not be done,” says Virendra.Shravan Kumar, another admirer of Rai, says: “There are many people who have the vision but there are a very few who also have a strong passion to work for their constituency.”Tussle For Political LegacyIronically, all candidates across party lines continue to prove themselves as the true heir of Rai’s rich legacy . Rai’s close family members, including his son Siddharth and his second wife Sudha Rai, failed to take forward his legacy and contested against each other, both losing the Lok Sabha polls in 1999. Sudha was fielded by the Congress while Siddharth was a candidate from George Fernandes-led Samata Party.“While every second person in Mau talks about Rai’s achievements, his home in Semari Jamalpur wears a deserted look. When Kalpanath Rai was alive, every person in and around his village was Kalpanath Rai in his own capacity,” says Narendra Rai, a native of Kalpanath’s village.“Not sure who all live here nowadays,” he sums up as the candidates fight for Rai’s legacy.Balkrishna Chauhan, who won in 1999 Lok Sabha election on BSP ticket after the death of Kalpanath Rai, is once again in the fray from BSP. He is pitted against SP-Congress alliance candidate Rajeev Rai and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP)-BJP alliance candidate Arvind Rajbhar. Arvind is the son of SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who is also the cabinet minister in Yogi Adityanath govt in the state.INDIA bloc’s Rajeev Rai promises to develop Mau as Kalpanath Rai did while Arvind Rajbhar and Balkrishna Chauhan promise to fulfil the dreams of Rai and develop the constituency like never before.Before this election, BSP won the seat thrice – Balkrishna in 1999, Dara Singh Chauhan, who is now a Cabinet minister in Yogi govt, in 2009, and sitting MP Atul Rai in 2019. SP’s Chandradeo Prasad Rajbhar won the election in 2004 and BJP’s Hari Narayan Rajbhar bagged the seat once in 2014.Congress has won the seat thrice – Kalpanath Rai twice in 1989 and 1991, and Umrao Singh in 1957.“Despite the level of development, even Kalpanath Rai had to sweat it out in Mau to win elections,” says Virendra and adds that the caste complexities and equations, which ruled then, dominate even now.","Kalpanath Rai was a four-time member of Lok Sabha and thrice of Rajya Sabha. He died on June 4, 1999, at the age of 58. All candidates across party lines continue to prove themselves as the true heir of Rai’s rich legacy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110431149,imgsize-939662,width-400,resizemode-4/110431149.jpg"

Addressing an election rally in Ghazipur, from where SP has fielded Afzal Ansari, the brother of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari who recently died in Banda jail, PM Modi said, ""During their rule, the mafia operated with impunity, brazenly challenging the law from open jeeps and killing rivals, while two to three riots took place each month.""

BJP has fielded Parasnath Rai against Ansari, while BSP has fielded Umesh Kumar Singh. He praised UP CM Yogi Adityanath, stating that under his government riots and rioters have been effectively curbed.

Describing himself as a watchman of the rights of the deprived, Dalits, and backward communities, he asserted that under his tenure reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs would remain intact.

"‘June 4 will be day of freedom; BJP to get final farewell, INDIA bloc & SP’s PDA will prevail'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/june-4-will-be-day-of-freedom-bjp-to-get-final-farewell-india-bloc-sps-pda-will-prevail/articleshow/110428822.cms,"SP chief and leader of Opposition in UP Assembly, Akhilesh Yadav, is leading a spirited campaign for INDIA Bloc in the ongoing LS elections. Amid a hectic campaigning schedule, he spoke to Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui about his PDA plank, tie-up with Congress and prospects of Opposition parties. Excerpts…

In your election speeches, you say INDIA bloc will win all 80 seats in UP. What is the assessment of your election war room?

You have always maintained that your political aspirations were limited to UP itself and that you don’t aspire for national politics. Has that changed now?

Is the present SP-Congress alliance much more cohesive and bonded as compared to the 2017 tie-up between the two?

What are the two factors that have worked the most for the INDIA bloc in terms of catching the attention of the electorate?

Where did this idea of PDA – Pichhade (Backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (Minorities) — come from?

In your 2019 interview with TOI you said SP’s quest for the right “glue” led to an alliance with the BSP then. You think PDA is the right glue?

You think PDA’s target audience has been all ears to you?

You were one of the first to say that BJP is looking to win 400 seats because they want to change the Constitution. Where did that come from?

In a never-before shift of strategy, the SP has fielded only five Yadavs and five Muslim candidates in these elections. Why?

Were there apprehensions of a possible backlash if the Yadavs and Muslims did not understand your strategy behind not fielding their caste / community candidates in appropriate numbers?

There is a perception that BJP gets more support from women than other parties, be it because of improved law and order, free ration or free gas connections.

Are you saying that our Indian borders are not as secure?

SP’s alliance partners in 2022 assembly polls like RLD, SBSP and leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Singh Chauhan are not with you now. You think their presence would have added to INDIA bloc’s position?

This is the first election after Mulayam’s demise, how different is it to handle the poll strategy, selection of candidates, poll issues in the absence of expert advice from him?

Your daughter Aditi, a student of international politics, campaigned for mother Dimple Yadav. Is she too planning to step into active politics?

How do you explain the flip-flop on fielding candidates? Candidates were changed on at least 10 seats.

In these elections, BJP will be given the final farewell. When results will be announced on June 4, it will be a day of freedom for many. June 5 INDIA bloc and Samajwadi Party ’s PDA bouquet will prevail. It will be a historical day and a day of celebrations for all.It’s the same. Lucknow is Lucknow. Who would like to leave Sheher-e- Lucknow? (Pauses)…One can always fly to Delhi and come back to Lucknow. (Smiles)Having entered into and walked out of quite a few alliances in the recent past, we have had experiences which have helped us to handle alliances better now. Also, the INDIA alliance leaders have held several meetings and long discussions which has helped us bond better.It sounds a bit unparliamentary but their (BJP’s) “jhooth” (lies) has worked the most. On top of it, their performance was zero. They have little political credibility left. For the past 10 years, BJP has been heading the government at the Centre. Add 7 years of UP government to it. The promises they made in 17 years of governance turned out to be false and so did their claims. Much hype was built around investors’ meet and Defence Expo. Right from the Prime Minister to ministers in states showcased it. But there is nothing on the ground. Even schemes like ODOP (One District One Product) have failed to make any headway. All the focus of the government was on publicity. People don’t want naam wali sarkar, people want kaam wali sarkar (People don’t want a government for namesake. They want one that delivers).Samajwadi Party has always tried to expand its family in order to take on the BJP in the present context. They (BJP/BSP) had attributed their electoral success to “social engineering”. This concept has been the crux of socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia’s call for “social justice” and Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) spent his lifetime for the cause. It is just that Samajwadi Party has now gone back to its roots with a more defined approach in the form of PDA which stands for Pichhade (Backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (Minorities) and also for Peedit (exploited), Dukhi (distressed), Agade (upper caste) and Aadhi Abadi (women). The idea behind PDA is to bring everyone together. There is another dimension to it. The letter P in PDA’s also stands for Progressive while the letter N in NDA (BJP-led National Democratic Alliance) denotes “negativity”. As for the acronym PDA, it was coined for phonetic effect and meant to “clash” with BJP’s NDA and it did. Also the more important underlying message here was that INDIA bloc was a larger alliance (national level) and PDA is our party’s own bouquet of like-minded masses who had similar aspirations and needs.Yes. PDA is definitely the right glue.Yes they have been. People are fed up with ‘Mann ki Baat’ (PM’s radio programme). They want the government to listen to the Constitution instead.People have seen through how the BJP government has gone against the Constitutional provisions. For instance, privatisation of airports. Imagine the extent to which backward classes and dalits will be deprived of reservation in these jobs. Another example is that of JNU and BHU. In both these universities, the percentage of employees from the PDA bracket is less than 15 per cent. Is there any reservation in class three, class four jobs that the government has outsourced? Is there any reservation in appointment of IAS and IPS officers through lateral entry? The most important part is that such decisions have eroded people’s trust and faith in the BJP government. Despite all this, the PM claims that he will protect the Constitution, and the BJP wants people to believe him.This strategy is based on my experience of 25 years in politics. At the risk of sounding boastful I am saying this but I don’t think there is a leader around who has toured across the length and breadth of UP as extensively as we have. No other leader has shaken as many hands with party workers, got photographs clicked with them, interacted with them on one to one basis. I had put my foot on the ground.There was no such apprehension ever. People, including the segment that you are referring to, along with Dalits and backward classes are much smarter and more intelligent than what one may choose to believe. Ye Dilli-Lucknow wale daraane ka kaam karte hain (referring to the PM and CM). People have seen how they (BJP) operate. There were instances when questions were raised over our silence on specific issues. We deliberately kept mum because we wanted to politically protect those at the receiving end. It was my own resolve from day one to politically protect them. There were some swarthi (selfish) politicians who wanted to brand me in a certain way from the very beginning but they couldn’t.Whose perception is that? Has this perception stemmed from the recent Nari Shakti Sammelan organized in Varanasi? (addressed by PM). What about the BJP government’s handling of the Manipur incident where our sisters were disrespected. In Varanasi itself, protesting BHU girl students of women’s hostels were manhandled by police. Crime against women and children is on the rise in UP. Real power of women in every family will come when they have money in their bank accounts. The INDIA bloc government will annually transfer Rs 1 lakh to a woman in every poor family, which will be around Rs 8500 per month. This will actually strengthen a woman’s position in every family. This perception that BJP gets the support of women is like the perception that the BJP government has kept the Indian borders secure.If that is the case then why is no one talking about why and how Rezang-la memorial was razed. That memorial was built to remember and salute the valour of a little over 100 Indian soldiers of Kumaon regiment who fought till the proverbial ‘last man, last round’ inflicting over 1,000 casualties on the enemy side. Why is there no word on it? And this is just one issue.Let bygones be bygones. There is no point discussing ifs and buts.Netaji’s (Mulayam Singh Yadav) absence will always be felt. But we are treading the path that he has shown. Whatever I have learnt from him, I put to use in life and in politics. What I have learnt from him in politics will always be treasured by me.I wanted her to have first-hand experience of how raw things are on ground in politics. One gets a sense of how people in rural areas work in sweltering heat. It started with her going door-to-door meeting people in villages and interaction with small groups of women. But soon more and more people started turning up.In quite a few instances the change of candidates was a part of our party’s counter strategy to counter BJP’s constituency specific moves. In some cases it was done to accommodate the demand of the local leaders and workers after due consultation and consent of the person being replaced.","Akhilesh Yadav is leading a spirited campaign for INDIA Bloc in the ongoing LS elections.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and the opposition leaders on Saturday strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his use of the term ""mujra"" to target the opposition alliance INDIA bloc , the leaders argued that such comments from a person holding such position in the country undermines the dignity of the post.These remarks came in response to PM Modi's earlier statement at rallies in Bihar, where he launched a scathing attack on the opposition alliance INDIA bloc and accused it of doing ""slavery"" and ""mujra"" for the Muslim vote bank.PM Modi said ""Bihar is the land which has given a new direction to the fight for social justice. I want to announce on its soil that I will foil the plans of the 'INDIA' coalition to loot the rights of SC, ST and OBC and give them to Muslims. They (the opposition bloc) may remain enslaved and perform 'mujra' to please their vote bank.""Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that no prime minister in the country's history has ever used such words for opposition leaders, adding that the entire nation holds the position of prime minister in high regard and it is his responsibility to maintain the dignity of the post. The prime minister has become nervous and has forgotten that he represents the country and its people, and such words should not have come out of his mouth, she added.She greeted the audience in Bhojpuri, saying, ""Raua sabhe ke Ram-Ram.""""Modi ji gave a speech in Bihar and uttered such words for opposition leaders which no prime minister in the history of the country would have said,"" the Congress general secretary said. ""Your faith and your hopes were once attached to Narendra Modi, but isn't it the responsibility of the prime minister to maintain the dignity of the post?"" she added.Quoting a composition by the renowned saint Baba Gorakhnath, Vadra said, ""The entire country respects the post of prime minister and we also respect him. But the way he (Modi) is speaking today, the sad thing is that his reality has been exposed.""She said the prime minister calls the entire country his family, but it does not reflect in his words. Vadra stressed on the importance of respect within a family, saying, ""Family members always have respect for each other (anko ki sharam) that should not be lost, that should always be kept.""The Congress General Secretary pointed out that unemployment in the country is at a 45-year high, calling it the ""biggest problem.""She questioned whether Prime Minister Modi addresses this issue, asking, ""Does Modi ji talk about this? Have you heard the word unemployment from Modi ji? Has the time now come for Prime Minister Modi to tell what unemployment is?""The congress leader Pawan Khera criticized PM Modi for using the term ""Mujra"" during a recent event. Khera is seen questioning the appropriateness of such language coming from the Prime Minister and further suggested that the Prime Minister appears to be exhausted and requires rest and medical attention.In a post on X, the Congress leader wrote in Hindi, ""Today Narendra Modi used the word 'Mujra' in a program. Does it suit the Prime Minister to use such words? The Prime Minister is tired. He needs some rest and treatment.""Speaking to ANI, Khera said, ""Is this the way a Prime Minister of a country speaks? Is there any provision for reservation based on religion anywhere in the Constitution? You have been a PM for 10 years, you have been sitting after taking the oath of the Constitution, you should have at least read what is written in it.""""Those who are giving out comments without reading the Constitution reflect their mentality to divide the country.

CAA protests in Assam

Previous Lok Sabha elections result

Can it affect the results in Assam and Bengal?

NEW DELHI: The three-phase election process in Assam has concluded. People in the state have voted for 14 seats and are anxiously awaiting the results on June 4, marking the first Lok Sabha elections since the implementation of the CAA.The state witnessed an intense campaign, with both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress making extensive efforts to woo voters. The campaign revolved around several issues but one of the most debated among them was the CAA.Amid the ongoing preparations for the Lok sabha polls, several organizations staged protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) across various districts of Assam, such as Guwahati, Barpeta, Lakhimpur, Nalbari, Dibrugarh, and Tezpur.The BJP leader and chief minister of Assam Himanta Biswa sarma had earlier said that, “CAA is part of our commitment, it is part of our ideology. We will implement it. Somebody questioned 'where is Ram Mandir, when it will come', you have seen Ram Mandir now, somebody has questioned 'when Article 370 will go', it has gone. The same way you will see UCC (Uniform Civil Code) coming, the same way you will see CAA coming.”Sarma said that he will be the first to step down if even one person, who has not applied for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state, gets citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA).The Assam chief minister said the Act is very clear that the cut-off date for application of citizenship is December 31, 2014, and in Assam, with the updation of the National Register of Citizens, people who applied for it and did not find their names in that list, will only apply for CAA.Strongly opposing the CAA West Bengal CM Mamata Bannerjee said, ""We are ready to shed blood for the country but will not tolerate torture for the country. A uniform civil code is not acceptable. I want harmony among all religions. Your safety. Your life. No NRC, no CAA.""Critics argue that the law, along with a proposed national register of citizens, could potentially lead to discrimination against India's 200 million Muslims, making it the world's third-largest Muslim population. They fear that the proposed National Register of Citizens could exacerbate existing discrimination and marginalization.However even the union home ministry has clarified these allegations on CAA and said that the Act ""does not prevent any Muslim, who is persecuted in those Islamic countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan) for practising their version of Islam, from applying for Indian citizenship under the existing laws"".""CAA does not cancel the naturalisation laws. Therefore, any person including the Muslim migrants from any foreign country, seeking to be an Indian citizen, can apply for the same under the existing laws,"" the ministry said.Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) candidate Lurinjyoti Gogoi from Dibrugarh Lok Sabha seat said, “The CAA is completely motivated, communal and unconstitutional, and a ploy of the BJP to burden Assam and its resources further. Our constitution has the principle of secularism enshrined in it, but the act is based on religious division.”Congress candidate Gaurav Gogoi from Jorhat Lok Sabha seat said, “In the first cabinet meeting of the INDIA alliance govt, CAA will be scrapped. This will be the most important issue.” Gaurav said during the campaign in Jorhat, which was once represented by his father and three-time CM Tarun Gogoi.As per details from Census 2011, Assam has a population of 3.12 Crores, an increase from the figure of 2.67 Crore in 2001 census. Total population of Assam as per latest census data is 31,205,576 of which male and female are 15,939,443 and 15,266,133 respectively.Here's a table summarising the population data for Assam from the Census 2001 and Census 2011:In 2001, total population was 26,655,528 in which males were 13,777,037 while females were 12,878,491. The total population growth in this decade was 17.07 percent while in the previous decade it was 18.85 percent. The population of Assam forms 2.58 percent of India in 2011. In 2001, the figure was 2.59 percent.Protests in Assam first emerged in 2018 when the amendment was still a bill awaiting passage into law. In 2019, Assam was among the pioneering states where protests against the CAA commenced, which later transformed into a nationwide movement.Student and indigenous groups, along with political parties, oppose the CAA, citing violations of the 1985 Assam Accord, which calls for the deportation of those entering from Bangladesh after March 24, 1971.With the issuance of the CAA rules, the central government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will grant Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014, following the implementation of the CAA rules. The CAA, which was passed in December 2019 but had not been enforced until now, includes Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, and Christians.The 2019 protests in Assam were unprecedented in their scale, matching the intensity of the demonstrations during the Assam Movement from 1979 to 1985. However, the current protests in 2024 have significantly diminished in scale when compared to the previous demonstrations.In the 2016 elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party made history by ending the Congress's 15-year rule and securing a decisive mandate that brought them to power in the state for the first time.BJP and its allies, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF), collectively won 86 seats in the 126-member Assam assembly. The BJP alone secured 60 seats, while the AGP and BPF won 14 and 12 seats, respectively.And later again in the Assam assembly elections in 2021, the BJP maintained its dominance by winning 60 seats, significantly outperforming the Congress, which managed to secure only 29 seats. Other parties, such as the AIUDF and AGP, put up a good performance, winning 16 and 9 seats, respectively.The Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal, two parties that emerged from the anti-CAA protests, managed to secure one seat each in the assembly.The opposition is still using CAA as a big agenda to fight against BJP. Assam politicians took to the streets protesting against implementation. Both Assam and Bengal politicians are using it as a rallying point against the BJP in the Elections.In its manifesto for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, titled 'Didir Shopoth (Didi's pledges)', the Trinamool Congress has vowed to repeal the recently notified Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and halt the National Register of Citizens (NRC) process. As a symbolic gesture of their opposition, they have also announced plans to burn copies of the Act in all district headquarters across the state.CM Sarma has said CAA won’t affect indigenous Assam population, no CAA application in 4 years and NDA will win all Lok Sabha seats.As himanta is confident that CAA won’t affect Lok Sabha election, opposition vows to make it a major issue and is betting on it to yield a different outcome compared to the 2021 assembly elections.It will be great to see if BJP can cross the 400-seat mark in a house of 543 parliamentary seats declared by PM Modi “Abki baar 400 paar,” breaking the opposition Congress Party record in 1984","Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) has become a major political issue in Assam and Bengal. Critics argue that the law, along with a proposed national register of citizens, could potentially lead to discrimination against India's 200 million Muslims. The union home ministry has clarified these allegations on CAA and said that the Act ""does not prevent any Muslim, who is persecuted in those Islamic countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan) from applying for Indian citizenship""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110426535,imgsize-64302,width-400,resizemode-4/110426535.jpg"

What’s in it for AAP?

Rivals in Punjab, friends in Delhi

NEW DELHI: Delhi is casting votes today in the sixth phase to elect seven candidates to the Lok Sabha. The BJP, which won all seven seats in both the 2014 and 2019 elections, is confident of another victory in the national capital. In a bid to break BJP's winning streak, its rivals Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP and the Congress, which contested separately in the previous polls, have joined forces. However, the data shows that even their combined might may not be enough to defeat the BJP in most of the seats.Once rivals, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party reached a seat-sharing agreement in late February after weeks of political conflict and deliberation. Both parties acknowledged their shared goal of defeating the PM Modi-led BJP and recognized the strategic advantage of their alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. However, the perception that AAP went back on its stance by partnering with a party it vehemently opposed during its inception is intensifying its existing challenges.In the 2014 general elections, the combined votes of Congress and AAP in six of the seven seats in Delhi outnumbered those of the BJP. However, by 2019, the BJP managed to secure more votes than the combined tally of the two parties in all seven seats. As the BJP was far ahead of both the parties individually in both the elections, a united front was the only way that the parties could potentially alter the electoral dynamics.In the 2019 general elections, the BJP secured 57% of the vote, Congress garnered 23%, AAP received 18%, and other parties accounted for 2%. In contrast, the 2020 state elections saw AAP’s vote share surging to 54%, Congress' vote share dropping to 4%, while the BJP received 39% and other parties remained at 3%. This stark variation in vote percentages within just a year is what the opposition parties are banking upon for the upcoming polls.From the outset, the alliance between AAP and Congress displayed visible fissures. However, Kejriwal’s arrest in connection with the liquor policy case gave the opposition parties a moment to show signs of unity in the otherwise broken INDIA bloc.Initially, many Delhi Congress leaders, including Arvinder Singh Lovely (who eventually resigned and joined the BJP), opposed the partnership. Now, however, this alliance is viewed more favorably, with Congress candidates hoping to garner sympathy and support after the Delhi chief minister's arrest.In the 2024 general elections, the AAP will contest on four seats: East Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi, and New Delhi. The Congress will contest on the remaining three seats: Chandni Chowk, North East Delhi, and North West Delhi.AAP, which emerged as a formidable political force in Delhi, did so largely at the expense of Congress. In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, AAP’s vote share surged to 54.3% from 29.5% in 2013, while Congress saw its vote share plummet from 24.5% to less than 10%. The trend continued in the 2020 Assembly polls, where Congress' vote share dipped further, suggesting that AAP’s support base largely comprised former Congress voters. The alliance with AAP offers Congress a lifeline in Delhi offering it an opportunity to regain some of its lost ground and increase its influence in the capital.For AAP, the alliance is crucial to maintain its political relevance on the national stage. AAP emerged as a significant opposition to the BJP in the 2014 elections. AAP at 32.90% vote share was just behind the BJP which had polled 46.40% votes. However, its voter base declined in 2019, with Congress seeing an uptick in its vote share. This shift suggested that while AAP was initially perceived as a viable alternative to the BJP, this perception weakened over time. By aligning with Congress, AAP hopes to consolidate anti-BJP votes and enhance its prospects in the 2024 general elections.Ironically, despite forming an alliance in Delhi, AAP and Congress remain political rivals in Punjab. Confident in their prospects in Punjab, they have chosen not to collaborate there. However, facing the BJP's stronghold in Delhi, they have decided to unite, recognising their individual weaknesses in the capital.The Congress-AAP alliance under the INDIA bloc is a move aimed at dethroning the BJP in Delhi. While the combined strength of the two parties offers a glimmer of hope for a formidable challenge, the success of this alliance will depend on their ability to effectively mobilize their voter bases, address internal dissent, and present a cohesive front against the BJP.","Delhi is casting votes today in the sixth phase to elect seven candidates to the Lok Sabha.

The grandfather's role in allegedly coercing the driver, who was in the car with the teen, into taking responsibility for the crash is under scrutiny, and his custody will allow for further questioning and evidence collection.

The family driver has given a statement saying he was not driving the car when it met with the accident and that the teen's kin were using pressure tactics to push him to take responsibility for the crash.

The crash has sparked outrage and raised questions about underage driving and the responsibility of parents and guardians in ensuring road safety.

A local court in Pune on Friday had remanded six accused arrested in the case, including the teenager's father, in judicial custody. The teenager is in an observation home till June 5.

Sources said passengers, especially first-time travellers , landing from airports in Tamil Nadu and Kerala are being randomly scrutinised.Travellers to Dubai and Abu Dhabi are facing delayed check-in at the city airport after the UAE deported a few passengers for not carrying return tickets or enough money for their stay with a tourist visa.

NEW DELHI: A day after Supreme Court declined to direct Election Commission to publish booth-wise elector data as recorded in Form 17C , the poll panel released the absolute number of eligible voters and votes cast across parliamentary constituencies in the first five phases, to set at rest ""false narratives"" about a ""delay"" in release of voter turnout data .Of over 76.3 crore eligible voters in the first five phases of the Lok Sabha polls, as many as 50.7 crore people have cast their vote, according to data shared by EC Saturday.The revision in format of release of turnout data came even as Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar questioned the trend of repeated raising of ""unfounded doubts"" on the electoral processes. ""First, questions are raised about purity of the electoral roll, then attempts are made to discredit EVMs. Amid polling, doubts are cast over turnout data,"" he underlined while speaking with TOI after completion of the penultimate phase of polling. Stating that the electoral processes, design and systems are well-settled and earnestly followed election after election, the CEC said polls conducted in around 22-23 states since the 2019 general election have followed the very same processes. ""Pattern in raising suspicion without concrete examples only when a general election to the Lok Sabha is under way must be studied,"" he told TOI.Describing the grievance redressal system of EC as ""very robust"", Kumar said: ""If there is indeed a mistake or failure, it must be pointed out. Planting unfounded doubts in the minds of voters as regards the electoral processes may adversely impact turnouts.""EC on Saturday reiterated that complete elector data is available with the authorised agents of all candidates as part of Form 17C, a copy of which is shared with them after polling. ""With approximately 10.5 lakh polling stations across the country, almost 40 lakh agents (assuming 3-4 agents per polling station) and around 8,000 candidates get all turnout data by way of Form 17C,"" said an EC official. Thus, the total number of votes polled in a constituency, as recorded in Form 17C can never be changed even by anyone's hypothetical mischief, it asserted.Asked why the absolute elector data was released only after five phases, Kumar said EC was awaiting the Supreme Court verdict in the relevant case. ""But the fact is that the polling data was always available, even as it was being updated, via the EC Voter Turnout app. Even a Class 6 student can calculate the absolute number of votes cast with the polling percentage and the total number of electors in a constituency released by the commission,"" he said. As per the electors data, around 11 crore of the total 16.6 crore electors voted in Phase 1 (66.1 per cent), 10.6 crore of a total 15.9 crore electors (66.7 per cent) in Phase 2, 11.3 crore of 17.2 crore (65.7 per cent) in Phase 3, 12.2 crore of 17.7 crore (69.2 per cent) in Phase 4 and 5.6 crore of 8.9 crore electors (62.2 per cent) in Phase 5.The commission reiterated that there was no delay in the release of voter turnout data, which, it said, is updated on a two-hourly basis till 1730 hours on polling day.
