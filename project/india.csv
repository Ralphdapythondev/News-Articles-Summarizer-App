Kota story: Why it remains a magnet for aspirants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kota-story-why-it-remains-a-magnet-for-aspirants/articleshow/111011238.cms,"A man Mahavar’s journey isn’t your typical, linear adversity-to-success story. He’s been a struggler all his life. After seven failed attempts to clear NEET until 2022, all he had was the consolation of going back to a job as a postman in Bikaner.Then Kota happened to him. In true Bollywood style, luck by chance.“I was working in a post office when I heard about Kota-based Motion Education’s scholarship lottery,” he recounts to TOI. “I filled out the online form and got selected. My grounded dream was back in motion.”Aman, who worked as a newspaper vendor and in shops since his school days to supplement his mother’s income as a worker in a hospital ward, is now on his way to becoming a doctor.In 2023, he cracked NEET on his eighth attempt and got a seat at GMC Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram. “It’s the best thing to have happened to me. I know the respect a doctor gets,” he says.Aman isn’t the only one to have his outlook towards failure, success, risk and process questioned and transformed in the often scoffed-at coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan.Most students who get past JEE Mains, JEE Advanced or NEET – arguably the toughest cycle of entrance exams in the world for sheer scale and competition – credit their success to the innovative, structured and personalised teaching methods employed by coaching institutes in Kota.Ved Sunil Kumar Shinde from Nagpur in Maharashtra, the all-India topper in NEET UG 2024 with 720/720, says studying at Allen Career Institute in Kota shaped his thought process in a manner that competitive exams didn’t appear as intimidating as he had imagined them to be.“We were motivated to compete in a healthy manner. Preparing for NEET at Allen proved the turning point for me, also helping me in the board exams. I did well in both,” says Ved.These institutes, some of which have spread their reach across India by setting up learning centres in cities and towns, operate on a model designed to train engineering and medical science aspirants to maximise their chances of making the cut rather than making them feel something is unachievable.For underprivileged students like Aman, many of these institutes provide financial support to get through the journey. The rest are encouraged to aim for in-house scholarships of up to 90% of the annual fee in some cases.Allen Institute runs a programme that offers free coaching to underprivileged students from government schools in predominantly Hindi-speaking states. These students are selected through a school-level examination. Those who qualify are brought to Kota, where the institute entirely covers their education, accommodation, and living expenses. This year, 126 students were selected.In 2023, about 2.5 lakh students received coaching in Kota, with over 85,000 new admissions by May. The city has 4,200-odd hostels, 25,000 PG rooms, and scores of one-bedroom apartments, some of which are rented by parents and guardians.Allen’s director, Rajesh Maheshwari, underscores the institute’s commitment to aiding students in need both academically and financially.“We try to make sure every student who wants help with studies specifically for these entrance exams gets proper mentorship. Children whose parents died in the line of duty are given education free of cost, no questions asked,” says Maheshwari.Aspirants who can’t attend classroom teaching for various reasons, including medical, have the option of recorded lectures.Maulik Patel, a student at Allen Institute, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2022, but recorded lectures ensured his studies and exam preparation didn’t suffer as much during the duration of his treatment and recovery.“After my first surgery, I was unable to attend coaching classes for a long time. Recorded lectures from Allen kept me in the preparation loop. My health improved after a second surgery last year, and I was able to take all major practice tests and rebuild my confidence,” he recalls.Maulik scored 94.67% in the Maharashtra state board’s Class 12 exam and 715/720 in NEET UG.In addition to recorded lectures, students at Kota institutes have access to equipped self-study rooms, immediate doubt-clearing sessions, online notes, and even professional counselling.AI is the latest entrant into this unique teaching system, spawning models like a “homework machine”.“At Motion, we have been using this AI-based homework machine built to give personalised questions for practice, based on the weaknesses and strengths of the student,” says Nitin Vijay, founder and CEO of Motion Education.“When students practice or take tests through this app, we identify the concepts they are unable to grasp. They are more likely to skip a question based on a concept they haven’t understood. If they guess, chances are they will get it wrong.”Institutes also focus on practicals to ensure comprehensive exam preparation. Resonance Eduventures Ltd, like the other large institutes, has fully-loaded labs for physics, chemistry and biology to improve students’ conceptual clarity.Additionally, digital classrooms and extempore competitions help build students’ confidence, complementing their academic training.","Most students who get past JEE Mains, JEE Advanced or NEET credit their success to the innovative, structured and personalised teaching methods employed by coaching institutes in Kota.

What’s behind close call at Mumbai airport?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-behind-close-call-at-mumbai-airport/articleshow/111010480.cms,"As Authorities Probe

Incident

Involving Air India And IndiGo Flights, Busy Schedules And Ignored Norms Are As Much Under Focus As The Peculiar

Runway

Infrastructure

India’s Busiest Airstrip

Too Close For Comfort

The ATC Question

Intersecting Runways

The incident of two planes coming within a whisker of each other on the Mumbai airport runway last week has raised serious questions: Has traffic density cut safety margins at the Mumbai airport? Is this kind of ‘bumper-to-bumper’ air traffic even normal? Had the aircraft taking off slowed down for some reason would the landing aircraft have crashed into it? Who was responsible for this dangerous situation — the pilots, Air Traffic Control (ATC) or a system that forces an infrastructure-constrained Mumbai airport to handle more and more flights?The incident was reminiscent of the runway collision at Haneda airport in Tokyo on Jan 2 this year. A Japan Airlines A350 aircraft collided upon landing with a Japan coast guard turboprop aircraft that was on the same runway. It was found that the Japan Airlines flight was given landing clearance while the Coast Guard aircraft did not have permission to be on the same runway.In Mumbai’s case, airlines operating the two flights have both said they had an all-clear from ATC — one to land and the other to take-off.Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the matter but it will be a while before the final report is out. Meanwhile, Airports Authority of India (AAI), the country’s air navigation provider, has already put in measures based on the preliminary findings.On June 8, an IndiGo aircraft touched down on runway 27 merely a second after an Air India aircraft took off. At that moment, the distance between the two aircraft was about 2,100 feet, sources said.The norm is to wait for the aircraft taking off to lift off and fly past the runway end before the aircraft landing can be allowed to cross the beginning of the runway.The 11,302ft long asphalt strip that is Mumbai airport’s runway 27 is arguably the priciest piece of real estate in the city, rented by the second to airlines that book time slots for takeoff and landing.An A320 or B737 aircraft takes an average of 40 to 50 seconds on the runway for a take-off or landing. Between each aircraft movement, a buffer or safety margin of about 20 seconds is maintained in normal conditions.‘Runway Occupancy Time’ or ROT, is thus a crucial parameter for flight operations at space-constrained Mumbai. Unlike most airports where distance is the criterion for maintaining a gap between two aircraft, Mumbai uses a time-based separation.Called ‘TTT’, or ‘Time to Threshold’, the ATC allows a take-off if the landing aircraft is a minimum of 70 seconds away from the runway threshold. “Time-based separation allows for more aircraft movement. In 24 hours, we save about 30 minutes,” said a senior air traffic controller. But if an aircraft is slow to take-off or if a landing aircraft comes in too fast, quick remedial steps need be taken by ATC.Two A320neo aircraft — AI flight AI-657 from Mumbai to Thiruvananthapuram and IndiGo flight 6E5053 from Indore to Mumbai — were involved in the inci dent. “The domino was triggered by the AI aircraft,” air safety expert Capt. Amit Singh said on the basis of Flightradar24 data.The incident unfolded in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the AI aircraft entered the runway for take-off. “The AI aircraft was slow to take-off after getting line-up clearance. Of course, one is assuming it received immediate take-off clearance,” added Singh.Per the norm, the AI pilot should have informed ATC about the delay in taking-off, which would have triggered a cancellation of his take-off clearance. But the AI pilots didn’t do that. They continued with the slow take-off. Meanwhile, the InidGo pilots were on an approach to land.The AI aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (the runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line).Did the IndiGo pilots err too? It appears so. Once they spotted an aircraft on the runway, they should have aborted landing and initiated a goaround. The norms state that ATC clearance is immaterial if a pilot spots a danger. “If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate a go-around,” it says.The incident occurred in clear weather. Pilots can hear each other communicate with the controller on the radio communications channel. Senior pilots pointed out that IndiGo pilots should not have continued with the landing after sighting the AI aircraft on the runway.DGCA has derostered the controller for investigations. Two days after the incident, AAI issued a circular stating that the preliminary investigation revealed violation of the standard operating procedure for ‘Time-Based Spacing’ between arrivals.“If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take-off run after issuance of take-off clearance, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately,” the SOP states. Since the AI aircraft took longer to begin the take-off roll, the controller should have cancelled its take-off permission, while also asking the IndiGo aircraft to carry out a missed approach or go-around.“The question is the degree of responsibility on each — the controller, the pilots and, most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at Mumbai airport that puts controllers and pilots in such situations,” said Singh.When the incident occurred, around 6.15 am, none of the airlines involved in the incident were scheduled to be on the runway. The delayed Iraqi Airways flight to Najaf took-off at 6.14 am though it was scheduled for a 5 am departure. The AI flight was scheduled to depart at 5.45 am, but was running over 20 minutes late. The IndiGo flight had a scheduled arrival at 6.40 am, but came in 20 minutes early.The peak-hour declared capacity of main runway 27 is 46 aircraft movements (arrivals/ departures). But Mumbai ATC often ends up handling close to 55 flight movements in 60 minutes as flights that are delayed or arrive early encroach into other flights’ slots. But on the congested Mumbai runway, the effects of “time slot indiscipline” can create potentially dangerous situations.Bunching up of flights during peak hours adds to the workload of both controllers and pilots. The major airports in the world and those in India, such as Delhi and Bengaluru are served by parallel runways, which allows for two runways to be used simultaneously. But Mumbai airport has a set of cross runways and so only one runway is in use at a time. More often than not, it is the workhorse runway 27.",Two planes came within a whisker of each other on the Mumbai airport runway last week. The incident has raised serious questions: Has traffic density cut safety margins at the airport? Is this kind of ‘bumper-to-bumper’ air traffic even normal?

"Kozhikode To London, A cyclist’s odyssey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kozhikode-to-london-a-cyclists-odyssey/articleshow/111010560.cms,"Fayis Asraf Ali’s

across 36 countries on a cycle spanned two years. The most cherished souvenirs he collected were the heartwarming acts of kindness bestowed by strangers

An intrepid Malayali adventurer has cycled over 18,000 miles through 36 countries from Kerala to London in a mind-blowing odyssey which took him almost two years. Fayis Asraf Ali, 37, an electronics and communications engineer from Kozhikode , left Thiruvananthapuram on Aug 1, 2022 and reached London on June 1, 2024 after riding through blistering heat and freezing cold weather on his Surly Disc Trucker, which weighed 50kg with his luggage.His two sons, Fahzin Omar (9) and Izin Nahel (5), his dentist wife, Dr Asmin Fayis, his mother and a bunch of his British Malayali friends, greeted him at Dover on May 29 after he crossed the English Channel by ferry from Calais. He camped on the beach and then spent two days cycling to his destination, the iconic Tower Bridge in London.Speaking from Newcastle, Ali told TOI: “Reaching the final point was a very big moment. My kids rushed up and hugged me. My children missed me but you have to sacrifice something to achieve something. They are proud of me.”The trip cost Rs25 lakh and Ali put in Rs2 lakh of his money towards it and raised the rest as he travelled, getting donations of money or food from local people and the Indian community, via a sign he parked in front of his bike telling passers-by he had cycled from India.Ali was taken aback by the hospitality he faced, with many locals inviting him into their homes.“People like cycling and they were shocked when they heard I cycled from India so were happy to donate money or food,” he said. In Antwerp, a homeless woman wandered up to him and gave him five euros.The journey took him through countries including Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, North Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, and France. “In Saudi, they provided police protection for me on the highways,” he said.The most he cycled in a day was in Turkey---175km. Otherwise, he cycled slowly as his bike was so heavy. He camped in the wild and near the roads rather than on campsites. His favourite country of all was the Netherlands. “The cycle lanes are perfect, and they even have them in small villages,” he said.In Denmark, a mother and daughter saw him cycling and when he told them he had cycled from India, they invited him to their house for a coffee and cake. “They were curious to know about my journey,” he said.He had no major mishaps along the way apart from losing his wallet during his 25-day stay in Iran. “I lost it when I was buying a sim card. For four days I had no money. An Iranian family, who spoke a little English, invited me to their house and said I could stay there and they gave me money also. Iran is beautiful, there are so many places to see,” he said. “Iraq was the most dangerous country I visited but now it is under control and is not that dangerous,” he explained. “I travelled on highways and there were lots of military checkpoints. I was scared, but I realized the people are really nice.”His favourite food of all was the Iskender kebabs in Turkey. During the trip, he gave talks at schools and universities and visited embassies. His goal was to spread awareness of fitness, eradicating polio, promoting conflict resolution, encouraging net zero and speaking against drugs. “People treated me like family,” he said, his phone bulging with the contact numbers of people from all over the world.It was his father’s illness which triggered this passion. He gave up his job as a network engineer in Saudi Arabia in 2015, when his father became critically ill, so he could look after him, being his only son. “I realized health is more important than money. I decided I should do some activities and started cycling and cycling became part of my life,” he said. His father passed away aged 67 in 2018.In Aug 2019 Ali did his first big cycle trip from India to Singapore across seven countries, pedalling nearly 5,000 miles arriving in Nov.Next, he plans to cycle through South America and North America. “I never felt lonely. Every day I was meeting new people and having new adventures and my wife was always on the end of the phone. It was exciting to experience new cultures. When I reached Tower Bridge I felt both happy and sad. Happy as I had achieved my goal and sad that it had ended.”","Fayis Asraf Ali, 37, left Thiruvananthapuram on Aug 1, 2022 and reached London on June 1, 2024.

""Concerns of students will be addressed with fairness and equity. The counselling process will be underway soon and it is of utmost importance to move ahead without any confusion,"" he said.Govt sources clarified that the FIR related to NEET in Patna concerned ""solver gangs"" rather than a paper leak as claimed by Congress. Also, sources in NTA said the average score of qualifiers in Bihar was lower than the national average, with only one topper from Patna this year. If there had been a leak, there would have been more than one topper from Patna and a higher number of high scorers, an NTA official said.NTA has faced criticism amid allegations of irregularities and inflated marks in the medical entrance exam conducted on May 5, the results of which were declared on June 4.On Congress's criticism of the lapses in NEET-UG, Pradhan said, ""They have just lost the elections and are now looking for a new issue. We have the facts, and misleading students and the public based on lies is not right."" On Congress's statement that the NEET issue would ""reverberate inside Parliament as well"", Pradhan said, ""I will reply with facts in Parliament.""Explaining the rise in toppers and cut-off marks this year, Pradhan said the NEET syllabus was reduced in line with NCERT's syllabus rationalisation.This, combined with aligning questions to state board syllabi and increased competition due to more candidates, led to the higher number of top scorers, he added.","Pradhan met several candidates who took the NEET-UG exam and their parents.

T20 World Cup 2024: India's Super 8 Group

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan secured a spot in the Super Eight phase of the 2024 T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea, knocking New Zealand out of the competition. Fazalhaq Farooqi led Afghanistan’s bowling, taking three wickets and contributing to PNG’s total of 95.Despite early losses, Afghanistan chased down the target in 15.1 overs, finishing at 101-3. Gulbadin Naib, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Nabi, with 16 not out, anchored the chase. This win, Afghanistan’s third in a row, guarantees their place alongside hosts West Indies in the next round. Farooqi’s performance brought his tournament wicket tally to 12, four more than his closest rivals, showcasing Afghanistan’s growing prowess in T20 cricket.As the group stage of the tournament edges towards its climax, numerous teams have solidified their positions in the Super Eight. India lead Group A, while Australia secure the top spot in Group B. Afghanistan dominate Group C, and South Africa lead Group D. Bangladesh emerge as a strong contender to claim the second spot from Group D, boasting victories in two out of three matches thus far.Several notable teams face significant challenges to secure their spots in the Super Eight:- New Zealand, and Sri Lanka are out of the T20 World Cup following a run of inconsistent performances in their respective groups.- After their win against Oman, England are in a better position. To advance, they must win their last match against Namibia. Additionally, they need Scotland to lose their final group-stage match to bolster their chances.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 will involve predetermined seedings for the top 8 teams, regardless of their performance in the group stage. This means that even if their rankings differ, their seeding positions will remain the same. In case any of the top 8 teams fail to qualify for the Super 8 stage, the team with the most points will take their spot but will assume the original team's seeding.The teams and their seedings are as follows:Even if the West Indies finish at the top of Group C, they will still hold the C2 seeding. On the other hand, if New Zealand does not qualify, they will nonetheless be designated as C1.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 features two groups, each composed of four teams. The teams are grouped based on their pre-determined seedings, ensuring a competitive mix in each group. Here are the groups for the Super 8 stage:Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)India's position as the top team in Group A (A1) has been solidified according to pre-determined seedings. They'll be joined in the Super 8 group by teams B2, C1, and D2. Interestingly, despite accruing more points than the defending champions, Australia finds itself in this group as the second-seeded team from Group B, following England's lead.A marquee match between India and Australia is already scheduled for June 24 at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground in Saint Lucia, promising an intense showdown for cricket fans worldwide.As the Super Eight stage approaches, the excitement and intensity of the T20 World Cup 2024 are ramping up.

"PM Modi, Biden to meet at G7, US says will keep raising murder plot at high level",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-biden-to-meet-at-g7-us-says-will-keep-raising-murder-plot-at-high-level/articleshow/110977701.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region. With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here.

"How engineer-turned-cop checkmated reel hero, jailed top Kannada film star Darshan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-murder-how-engineer-turned-cop-checkmated-reel-hero/articleshow/110982273.cms,"Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder. Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played a key role in the case. Girish and the police commissioner have become'real heroes' for many young cops.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

Kishor criticized Kumar for not leveraging his political influence to benefit Bihar, instead focusing on securing his political future with BJP support.""There is so much talk about Nitish Kumar playing a key role in PM Modi's return to power.

MUMBAI: The bones and remains allegedly belonging to Sheena Bora, recovered by police in Raigad, Maharashtra, are currently untraceable, the prosecution said to a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court during the ongoing trial.

This disclosure was made on Thursday during the deposition of a forensic expert from the state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Mumbai. The court is currently recording the testimony of the forensic expert who first examined the bones recovered by the Pen police in 2012 from the site where Sheena Bora's burnt body was allegedly buried, as reported by PTI.

Indrani Mukerjea, Sheena Bora's mother, is the prime accused in the murder case. According to police, the 24-year-old Sheena Bora was killed in April 2012, though the crime only came to light in 2015.

On Thursday, Special Public Prosecutor CJ Nandode informed the court that the bones and remains, which were referred to and examined by the forensic expert, could not be located despite a thorough search. Nandode added that the prosecution plans to continue the chief examination of the witness without displaying the articles, as they are untraceable.

The CBI court adjourned the matter to June 27 for further evidence recording after defense advocates raised no objections to the prosecution's request.

He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.","Nishant Agrawal worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur.

What is the case about?

NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara has a word of advice for state's former chief minister and senior BJP leader B S Yediyurappa , who faces allegation of sexual assault on a minor girl. Yediyurappa , who is believed to be in the national capital, on Friday got temporary relief from Karnataka high court which put a hold on his arrest by Karnataka CID till June 17, the date of next hearing. The court also ordered the former chief minister to appear before CID for questioning.A Bengaluru court had on Thursday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Yediyurappa after the senior BJP leader failed to appear for questioning in the case, which was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Posco) Act on March 14 this year.""A warrant has been issued for Yediyurappa. Police will bring him along with them and get all the information related to the case. Then legal action will be taken. There is information that he is in Delhi. He said he would come on Monday, 16th June,"" Parameshwara told reporters on Friday. ""It is good if he comes back soon,"" the Karnataka home minister added.The case has triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP has claimed political vendetta and has accused the Karnataka government of hatching conspiracy against the saffron party after the Congress's dismal show in Lok Sabha elections.""Shocked by the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leaders are engrossed in hatching one conspiracy after another against the BJP,"" the BJP said.""Previously, the home minister Parameshwara himself had stated that the complaint from the mentally unstable woman was malicious and without merit. It is absurd that the case is being revived after three months,"" the BJP claimed.The Congress, which had sweeped the assembly elections in the state, won 9 out of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state while the BJP got 17.The BJP has also claimed that Karnataka government was maligning Yediyurappa to divert attention from corruption charges involving former minister B Nagendra in the Maharshi Valmiki Development Corporation. Nagendra had resigned subsequently.""Why is the government focusing on Yediyurappa ji's only, among 53 complaints filed by the woman, including against her own children and husband? Why plot a sudden arrest three months after the complaint was filed? If Congress leaders in Delhi succumb to such vile, vindictive politics and target Shri Yediyurappa ji, there is no doubt that Congress will be thrown out of Karnataka,"" it added.The Congress has rejected all these allegations.""BJP says so. They had sent the video to FSL, the report should come, right? All checks should be done as per the procedure. Yediyurappa is a senior person and one of the VIPs, so everything should be checked,"" home minister Parameshwara said.The BJP has also alleged that Rahul Gandhi was behind the state government's decision to implicate Yediyurappa.""Congress, resentful towards the BJP, is now attempting to arrest our respected leader BS Yediyurappa, based on a complaint from a mentally unstable woman. This comes after Rahul Gandhi faced court proceedings for spreading misinformation against BJP in Karnataka ,"" the BJP Karnataka said on Thursday in a post on X.However, Parameshwara rejected reports of Rahul's involvement and said, ""No, why will he (Rahul) involve himself in this? There is no use in simply cooking up a story. It is a local issue ... there is no pressure from anyone.""According to police, Yediyurappa has been booked under the Posco Act and Section 354 A (Sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on a complaint by the mother of a 17-year-old girl who alleged that he molested her daughter during a meeting on February 2 this year, at his residence in Dollars Colony. The victim's brother had filed a petition in the court earlier this week alleging that though the case was registered on March 14, no progress has been made in the investigation.

has the capability to abort an attack if necessary and can be safely retrieved. It is named loitering munition due to its ability to hover above the target. In ""Kamikaze mode,"" it can neutralize any hostile threat with GPS-enabled precision strike, achieving an accuracy of 2m.

The remotely controlled weapon is mounted on a UAV that can fly at an altitude of over 4,500 meters, making it undetectable by radar. For instance, if the target is a caravan carrying a militant leader expected to reach a specific location at a given time, the Nagastra can loiter in the air and strike when the target arrives. It hits in a kamikaze mode, destroying both the target and itself.

The fixed-wing electric UAV has an endurance of 60 minutes with a man-in-loop range of 15km and an autonomous mode range of 30km.

In addition to day-night surveillance cameras, the Loiter Munition is equipped with a warhead capable of defeating soft-skin targets.

The abort, recover, and reuse features of this Loiter Munition make it superior to similar systems developed by advanced countries. If the target is not detected or the mission is aborted, it can be called back and make a soft landing using a parachute.

Nagastra-l is the first indigenized weapon of its class, capable of hovering in the air and striking when the target arrives.

NEW DELHI: Solar Industries , based in Nagpur, has delivered the first indigenously developed Loitering Munition, Nagastra–1 , to the Indian Army .The Indian Army has placed an order with Solar Industries' Economics Explosives Ltd (EEL) for the supply of 480 Loiter Munitions under Emergency Procurement Powers.""After successful completion of pre-delivery inspections, EEL delivered 120 Loiter Munitions to an Army Ammunition Depot,"" news agency ANI quoted defence officials as saying.","Solar Industries has delivered the first indigenously developed Loitering Munition, Nagastra–1, to the Indian Army.

"One in three elders had no income in past one year, only 29% had access to pension, provident fund",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-in-three-elders-had-no-income-in-past-one-year-only-29-had-access-to-pension-provident-fund/articleshow/111007018.cms,",

NEW DELHI: One in every three elders reported not having any income in the past one year, 32% elderly or their spouses had an annual income of less than Rs 50,000 and only 29% elderly reported having access to social security schemes like old-age pension, contributory pension or provident fund. Nearly, 65% of elders reported that they were financially not secure with their current income and access to savings and investments.These findings are part of a report released by voluntary organisation ‘HelpAge India’ on the eve of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day observed on June 15.On the health frontmore than half the elderly (52%) reported facing at least one challenge related to activities of daily living and 54% suffered from two or more non-communicable diseases.As many as 5,169 elders and 1,333 caregivers’ primary family members were surveyed across 20 Tier I and Tier II cities, in 10 states. The study captured the experiences of elderly from cities like Jaipur, Bikaner, Faridabad, Panipat, Kanpur, Bareilly, Indore, Ujjain, Kolkata, Siliguri, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Greater Mumbai, Solapur, Chennai, Salem, Bengaluru and Hubli-Dharwad.These findings are important in the backdrop of the significant demographic shift in India with the population above 60 to double from 10.5% in 2022 to 20.8% by 2050.The report, ‘Ageing in India: Exploring Preparedness & Response to Care Challenges’, showed that only 31% elderly reported access to health insurance. Coverage was largely under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, along with ESI and CGHS. A very small proportion of respondents (3%) reported purchase of commercial health insurance. The reasons for not havinghealth insurance were mainly focused on lack of awareness (32%), affordability (24%) and lack of need for it (12%).Elder abuse continues to be a major concern, with 7% elderly admitting to being a victim of abuse with sons (42%) and daughters-in-law (28%) being the primary perpetrators. “A higher percentage of elderly who faced abuse in the past one year were illiterate, and the abuse increased with decrease in income of the elderly, as the majority of the respondents (73%) who faced abuse reported an annual income of less than Rs 100,000,” the report said.Also, most elderly who faced abuse were suffering from NCDs. Almost all elderly (94%) who faced abuse reported at least one chronic disease. This increased the dependency levels of elders on family members, the report said.Regarding types of action taken to resist elder abuse, most elders who experienced abuse revealed that they have scolded or requested the abusers to not do so in the future, others have either reported to their friends or other trusted members in the family or they didn’t do anything at all. A negligible portion reported that they have lodged a police complaint regarding the abuse.Sadly, awareness about the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act, which is an important enabling legal resource for the distressed elderly, is still quite low at 9%.The study shows that the family played the role of primary caregivers, when the elderly were bedridden and highly dependent. Almost all elders reported that their spouses or children took care of them in this situation. ""The demands placed on caregivers are significant, with a majority (68%) of caregivers reporting they provide support to their elderly every day. On an average, a caregiver has spent around 20 hours in the past week that is close to three hours every day,"" it is highlighted.Infact, the caregivers in the family faced their own challenges with around 29% of the caregivers reporting physical challenges in providing care to the elderly person, while 32% also reported facing financial challenges in providing care to the elderly.On the digital empowerment front, while 41% of elders reported having access to a digital device , 59% did not have access to a digital device. The most common device being used was a smart phone, with 39% elders having access to it. The gender digital divide was quite prominent, with 48% male elderly having access to a digital device, as against 33% women elderly. It comes through in the analysis that access to digital devices dropped significantly with increasing age, with only 26% of those above 80 years reporting having access to any digital device.HelpAge India CEO Rohit Prasad asserted that aAs people live longer and elderly population grows, some segments like the 80 plus, those living alone and older women face high vulnerability and require a special response. ""There is an urgent need to collectively develop a comprehensive long term care framework on provision and financing, together with all stakeholders,” Prasad said.","One in every three elders reported not having any income in the past one year. 65% of elders reported that they were financially not secure with their current income.

No complaint received in last 3 yrs of hate crimes by one community against other: NCM chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-complaint-received-in-last-3-yrs-of-hate-crimes-by-one-community-against-other-ncm-chief/articleshow/111007017.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three days after minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju dismissed talk of persecution of minorities as “propaganda” by vested interest, the National Commission for Minorities chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura said that in the last three years they have not received any complaint of hate crimes by one community against another. He said, however, that they have been receiving individual cases of crimes involving minorities which, Lalpura said can be best categorised as “criminal acts”.“We get a lot of complaints ranging from marital disputes to property and we have been taking action in these. However, where one community fights against the other community such cases are zero,” Lalpura said.To bolster confidence of minority communities, quell insecurities and to understand their expectations, the NCM will be holding inter-faith meetings and to begin with on June 20 the NMC has plans to hold a “Sarv Dharm Samvad” where prominent members of the six minority communities will be invited for discussion. The NCM chief along with the members will also be visiting Ayodhya later this month. This will be their first visit since the Ram temple consecration.On being questioned over recent statement of AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi that instances of attacks on Muslims after elections have increased, Lalpura said he would like to publicly ask Owaisi to not just make statements but to bring these instance to the notice of the commission so that they can be investigated and action taken accordingly. Owaisi in a post on X on Thursday said, “Since the election results have come, instances of attacks on Muslims from different parts of the country have been increasing. Two Muslims were killed in UP, bulldozer was run over the houses of Muslims in Akbarabad and two Muslims were lynched in Chhattisgarh. Is the Sangh parivaar taking revenge from Muslims?”Meanwhile, Lalpura also condemned the comments made by former Pakistani cricketer Kamran Akmal on Indian cricketer Arshdeep Singh. In a viral video, Akmal was seen making fun of Arshdeep’s Sikh religion.Reacting sharply, Lalpura said, “The Sikhs account for a miniscule minority in Pakistan. They are not safe there because people like Kamran Akmal have a biased mindset against the Sikhs.”","The National Commission for Minorities chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura said that in the last three years they have not received any complaint of hate crimes by one community against another.

"El Nino's reign ends, boost for August-September rains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/el-ninos-reign-ends-boost-for-august-september-rains/articleshow/111006966.cms,"After dominating global weather for nearly a year, El Nino 's reign has finally ended, US weather agencies reported late Thursday. The update said the Pacific Ocean is likely to transition to La Nina in around two months' time, which implies that conditions will generally favour good monsoon rainfall in India in the second half of the season (Aug-Sept).The latest update from US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration gives a 65% probability of La Nina developing in July-Sept period, a little later than what last month's forecast suggested, but still in time to potentially impact the monsoon. Last month's NOAA forecast had given nearly 50% probability of La Nina conditions developing in the June-Aug period, which has since dipped to around 40%.This is largely in line with IMD's forecast of an above-normal monsoon in India during the four-month season at 106% of long period average, with increased probability of good rains in latter half.""Latest US forecast is a good sign for the monsoon. Even if La Nina is declared around Aug, temperature anomalies that characterise the condition are already developing. The transition from neutral to La Nina during the monsoon season augurs well,"" said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of Union earth sciences ministry.La Nina is a meteorological condition recurring every three to seven years in which surface waters in central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean cool to below-normal levels, with associated changes in wind patterns impacting weather across large parts of the globe. El Nino is the opposite condition, characterised by abnormal heating up of ocean waters. El Nino/La Nina is the single largest natural source of year-to-year variations in seasonal climate.While El Nino events generally lead to below-par monsoons in India, last year being an exception, La Nina usually aids good monsoon rains. The last El Nino developed around May 2023 and peaked in Dec-Jan as one of five strongest such events on record. NOAA said Thursday that conditions in the Pacific returned to 'neutral' last month, which meant that El Nino had dissipated.Meanwhile, monsoon's onset over India has so far been good - with all of south India & northeast, and most of Maharashtra covered - but the system has weakened and is likely to remain so for 7-10 days, experts say. Countrywide rainfall in June has been 12.2% below normal.""With monsoon going into a hiatus, June may end with below-normal rainfall,"" said Rajeevan. Monsoon's weakening also dims hopes of rains arriving early in north India, which is currently reeling under an unprecedentedly long and severe heat spell.","Latest US forecast is a good sign for the monsoon.
