"Unified Pension Scheme vs OPS vs NPS: How is UPS different from National Pension Scheme, Old Pension Scheme?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unified-pension-scheme-vs-ops-vs-nps-how-is-ups-different-from-national-pension-scheme-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/112796028.cms,"UPS vs OPS vs NPS

:

Unified Pension Scheme (UPS): Top Features

Under the UPS, employees with a minimum qualifying service of 25 years will receive an assured pension of 50% of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to superannuation.

For service periods between 10 and 25 years, the pension will be proportional.

In the event of an employee's demise, their family will receive an assured pension of 60% of the employee's pension immediately before their demise.

The scheme also includes an assured minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service.

The UPS will apply inflation indexation to the assured pension, assured family pension, and assured minimum pension.

Dearness Relief will be based on the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW), similar to service employees.

Additionally, employees will receive a lump sum payment at superannuation, calculated as 1/10th of monthly emoluments (pay + DA) for every completed six months of service. This lump sum payment is separate from gratuity and does not impact the assured pension amount.

Employees choosing the UPS will not incur any extra financial burden. Their contribution will stay at 10 percent, while the government's contribution will rise from 14 percent to 18.5 percent.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Top Features

Under NPS, central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government contributes 14%, according to an ET report.

The pension amount in NPS is not fixed as it is linked to market movements, whereas UPS provides an assured pension of 50% of the salary for those who joined the service after January 1, 2004.

Family pension under NPS depends on the accumulated corpus in the pension fund and the chosen annuity plan at retirement.

NPS has been implemented for all government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined the central government on or after January 1, 2004. It is also available for private-sector employees. Most state/Union Territory governments have also notified NPS for their new employees.

Old Pension Scheme (OPS): Top Features

The Old Pension Scheme (OPS) provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 percent of their last drawn salary. This amount was subject to increase in line with the hike in the Dearness Allowance (DA) rates. Upon retirement, employees were also entitled to receive a gratuity payment, with a maximum limit of Rs 20 lakh.

Under the OPS, if a retired employee passed away, their family would continue to receive pension benefits. Another notable aspect of the OPS was that no deductions were made from an employee's salary towards pension contributions, which is in contrast to the NPS.

The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees who joined the service after January 1, 2004. This scheme, which will be implemented from April 1, 2025, guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the basic salary. The decision to introduce UPS comes in response to several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.Employees have the option to choose between UPS and NPS.So how does UPS compare to NPS? And how does it compare to the OPS? We take a look:NPS and the newly proposed UPS differ in terms of government contributions, pension amounts, and family pension provisions.Recently, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Punjab, have made the decision to revert to the Old Pension Scheme, moving away from the NPS.","The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme.

Is UPS a Step Backward?

The Central government has recently launched the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an alternative to the current National Pension System (NPS) for its employees. Scheduled for implementation in April 2025, this new scheme presents a significant choice for employees who joined after 2004. Should they remain with NPS or transition to the new UPS? Here’s a detailed comparison to assist you in making an informed decision.The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced in 2004 as a defined contribution scheme, replacing the Old Pension Scheme (OPS).Under NPS, employees contribute 10% of their salary, while the government contributes 14%. The corpus is invested in a mix of government securities, equities, and corporate bonds, similar to mutual funds. Upon retirement, 40% of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity.The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), on the other hand, offers a guaranteed pension of 50% of the average pay for the last 12 months for employees who have served for 25 years or more. The government’s contribution under UPS is set at 18.5%, with the employee's contribution remaining at 10%. Additionally, UPS includes a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000 for those who have worked for at least 10 years, along with a lump sum retirement benefit.The UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits. Here's a breakdown:Employees with at least 25 years of service will receive a guaranteed pension of 50% of their average basic pay.In case of an employee's death, their spouse will receive a family pension of 60% of the employee's pension.Employees with at least 10 years of service will receive a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month.Both the assured pension and family pension will be adjusted for inflation.Retirees under the UPS will receive Dearness Relief.Employees will receive a lump sum payment at retirement.One of the most significant advantages of UPS is the increased government contribution of 18.5%, compared to 14% under NPS. This boost in contribution is expected to result in a larger pension corpus, ensuring better financial security post-retirement.UPS guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the average salary over the last 12 months of service. This assurance makes UPS a safer option for risk-averse employees, particularly given the market volatility that can impact the returns on NPS investments.For employees with at least 10 years of service, UPS offers a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000, providing a safety net for lower-earning employees. Additionally, the scheme includes a lump sum payment at retirement, linked to the duration of service, offering further financial support.While UPS offers a guaranteed pension, it limits the potential for higher returns that NPS might offer through market-linked investments. Under NPS, employees can choose from various investment options, including up to 65% in government securities, 15% in equities, and the remainder in corporate bonds. However, these investments are subject to market risks, and the final pension amount may vary.In contrast, UPS protects employees from market fluctuations, providing a stable and predictable income stream in retirement. For many, especially those nearing retirement, this stability may outweigh the potential for higher returns under NPS.Some may argue that UPS represents a step back from the market-linked reforms introduced with NPS. However, UPS retains the core principle of a defined contribution scheme, with additional safeguards to ensure a minimum pension. It also addresses the growing demand for a guaranteed pension among government employees, without reverting to the unfunded liabilities of the Old Pension Scheme.","The Central government has recently launched the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an alternative to the current National Pension System (NPS) UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits.

Amendment to ensure capital punishment for convicted rapists

'Please come back to work'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , who is under all-round attack over the Kolkata rape-murder case, on Wednesday trained her guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and warned of adverse consequences for other states if the BJP tried to instigate trouble in Bengal.""Some people think this is Bangladesh. I love Bangladesh; they speak like us and share our culture.But remember, Bangladesh is a separate country and India is a separate country. Modi Babu you are using your party to cause fire here. But remember, if you burn Bengal .... Assam, northeast, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Delhi won't remain unaffected. We will disturb your chair also,"" a cornered Mamata said at the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) foundation day rally.Mamata unleashed a scathing attack at the BJP which has been spearheading protests against the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's R G Kar Medical College and Hospital and asked the Trinamool workers to respond. ""The time has come to resist and protest when you are insulted. When faced with ugly attacks, do not take it lying down. How you respond is up to you,"" the Trinamool Congress chief said.West Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar accused Mamata of making ""anti-national"" remarks and shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah urging the Centre to take cognisance of her statements. The West Bengal BJP leader charged Mamata with blatantly endorsing revenge politics and urged Amit Shah to safeguard the interests of people of West Bengal.""It is unthinkable and unprecedented for a chief minister, who is constitutionally bound to rise above partisan attitudes, to make such intimidating statements that pose a threat to democracy,"" he said.Mamata, on the other hand, accused BJP of hatching a conspiracy to derail probe into the rape-murder incident.“They called the bandh since they wanted political dividends over a dead body. The BJP is trying to exploit the emotions of ordinary people in the wake of the death of the young woman. They want to malign Bengal and plotted a conspiracy to derail the probe into her death so that the victim and her family do not get justice,” Mamata said.She also alleged that the BJP was ""indulging in large-scale cyber crimes using AI, causing social unrest"".""We have dedicated this day to the RG Kar doctor. We want justice but BJP today called for a bandh. They don't want justice, they are only trying to defame Bengal,"" Mamata Banerjee said.On the demand for her resignation in the wake of the RG Kar hospital incident, she said, “I will ask BJP why Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not resign owning up to his failure to prevent atrocities and sexual attacks on women in Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur and Assam. I ask why only an accused was killed in an encounter in Assam?""The BJP is making such demands as it has suffered a string of defeats in elections and knows that it won't be able to win in future, Banerjee said.Mamata Banerjee announced that her government would pass an amendment to existing laws next week to ensure capital punishment to convicted rapists. Banerjee said that she would sit for dharna outside Raj Bhavan here if the governor delays in giving assent to the amended bill or forwards it to the President for ratification.The chief minister also said that the TMC will launch a movement from Saturday at the state's grassroots to create pressure on the Centre to pass legislation for capital punishment of convicted rapists.“We will pass the amended bill in a special session of the assembly next week. We will then send it to the governor for his nod. We will stage dharna outside Raj Bhavan if he sits on the bill,” she said and added ""women will be at the forefront of the proposed dharna accompanied by 'their brothers'"".Mamata Banerjee urged the agitating junior doctors of Bengal, who have struck work for 20 days, now to urgently consider returning to duty.“I have remained sympathetic towards the cause of the doctors from the very beginning since they were seeking justice for their colleague. We did not take any action against them although so many days have passed since the incident. We understand your pain. But please come back to work now since patients are suffering,” she appealed.The police recovered the body of the woman's postgraduate trainee doctor from the seminar hall of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. The junior doctors of state-run hospitals have been on cease work since that evening, demanding justice for the victim and strong security measures in hospitals.Banerjee added no FIR was lodged against any doctor so far as she did not want any medic's career to be plagued by police cases.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is under all-round attack over the Kolkata rape-murder case. She warned of adverse consequences for other states if the BJP tried to instigate trouble in Bengal.

""I am used to struggles,"" Soren said and indicated that he will resign from JMM and as a minister later today.The former Jharkhand chief minister, who will join the BJP on August 30 in Jharkhand capital Ranchi, said he had taken the decision to join the saffron party to save tribal identity and existence, which is at stake in the state's Santhal Pargana region due to “rampant” infiltration from Bangladesh.""We all know that Champai Soren is a minister in the Jharkhand government, he is also an ex-chief minister.

If the judicial officer has a higher degree, like LLM or equivalent against the required qualification of LLB, he/she gets three advance increments in his pay scale. An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000. There are around 23,000 judicial officers distributed unevenly in different states, where as many as 4.5 crore civil and criminal cases are pending. Of these 38% of cases are less than one year old.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra agreed to examine the grievance raised by judicial officers that states do not pay advance increment for higher qualification on promotion under assured career progression (ACP), if the increments had been paid once. This means, with every promotion, they would be getting three increments if they had a higher qualification, which the CJI-led bench said prima facie it finds to be legitimate.In addition to the usual allowances like - DA, HRA, medical allowance during service and after retirement, earned leave encashment, LTA, conveyance, telephone and mobile phone allowance, the judicial officers are entitled to hill area/tough location allowance.If they are posted in trouble torn/ militancy infested or border areas, they are entitled to a risk allowance. Nagaland said it was not paying risk allowance to judicial officers as it has disentitled civil servants from getting the same.

Kolkata Doctor Rape Murder: 'Enough is enough': President Droupadi Murmu speaks out on Kolkata rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enough-is-enough-president-droupadi-murmu-speaks-out-on-kolkata-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112870105.cms,"NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu for the first time has publicly spoken about her views on the Kolkata incident through an article titled "" Women's Safety : Enough is Enough .""Declaring that ""enough is enough,"" Murmu stressed upon the urgency of addressing the harmful mindset that views women as ""less powerful, less capable, less intelligent,"" because of which women are often objectified and victimised.In a powerful statement, she said that both the government and society must work together to change this mentality.In a signed article for PTI, the president expressed her deep dismay and horror over the recent rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata on August 9.Tragedy that has once again shook the nation's conscience and sparked widespread protests. This incident, she said, is not a single case but part of a distressing pattern of violence against women.""Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere. The victims include even kindergarten girls,"" Murmu said.""No civilised society can allow its daughters and sisters to be subjected to such atrocities,"" wrote Murmu.""The nation is bound to be outraged, and so am I,"" she added.Reflecting on the context of women rights, Murmu stated that throughout history, women have to fight for every inch of progress.Social prejudices and customs have often restricted the expansion of women’s rights, leading to a ""deplorable mindset"" that views women as inferior. This mindset, she argued, is a root cause of the crimes committed against them.""It is ingrained deeply in the minds of such people,"" the president wrote, stressing that countering this mentality is a task for both the country and society at large.While laws and social campaigns are made, Murmu agrees that there is still ""something that continues to come in the way and torment us.""She highlighted the need for honest self-reflection, urging society to confront its collective failures. ""History often hurts,"" she said, pointing out that societies that are afraid to face history tend to bury their heads in the sand, like the proverbial ostrich.""Now the time has come not only to face history squarely but also to search within our souls and probe the pathology of crimes against women .""She called for a comprehensive approach to tackling the root causes of these crimes, starting with honouring the memory of the victims and fostering a culture that remembers these tragedies to prevent future ones.""Let us deal with this perversion in a comprehensive manner so as to curb it right at the beginning,"" she urged.The president also shared an instance from a recent Raksha Bandhan interaction with school children, where they asked her if incidents like the Nirbhaya case could ever be prevented in the future.She expressed her frustration that, despite efforts made after that 2012 Delhi gang rape incident, similar tragedies continue to occur.""Did we learn our lessons?"" she asked, noting that as social protests fade, these incidents are usually forgotten until another heinous crime happens.The society needs honest, unbiased self-introspection, and asks itself some difficult questions, the president said.""Where have we erred? And what can we do to remove the errors? Without finding out the answer to that question, half of our population cannot live as freely as the other half,"" she said.","President Droupadi Murmu for the first time has publicly spoken about her views on the Kolkata incident through an article titled "" Women's Safety : Enough is Enough.""Declaring that ""enough is enough,"" Murmu stressed upon the urgency of addressing the harmful mindset that views women as ""less powerful""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112870107,imgsize-1602730,width-400,resizemode-4/112870107.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India will finally commission its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles as INS Arighat on Thursday, in a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities.The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750-km, will take place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.TOI was the first to report on Aug 11 that INS Arighat’s commissioning was now imminent after the 6,000-tonne boat became “fully ready” following protracted extensive trials and technological upgrades.INS Arighat will now join her forerunner INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to strengthen the country's ' nuclear triad ’ or the capability to fire nukes from the land, air and sea.“While INS Arighat is of the same size, length and displacement as INS Arihant, she can carry more K-15 missiles. The new boat is much more capable, efficient and stealthy,” a source said.Both INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors at their core. The miniature nuclear reactors fitted in their hulls ensure they can stay submerged for months on end, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that must surface or “snorkel” every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.The real punch in India’s deterrence capabilities will come when the third SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles), a slightly larger 7,000-tonne vessel, is commissioned next year. To be called INS Aridhaman, she will carry K-4 missiles that can hit targets 3,500-km away.A fourth SSBN is also being constructed under the classified Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project to bolster the country’s weak sea-based leg of the nuclear triad. The other two legs, the land-based Agni ballistic missiles and fighter jets like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s and Rafales that can drop nuclear gravity bombs, are much more robust.Given India’s declared “no-first use” nuclear doctrine, SSBNs are crucial for deterrence because they are difficult to detect and can escape a surprise first strike by an enemy to launch retaliatory strikes.India, of course, still has a long way to go. Countries like the US, Russia and China have much larger SSBNs armed with longer range missiles. China, for instance, has six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, apart from six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs, meant conventional warfare). The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.TOI had also reported earlier this month that the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ SSNs, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations. It will take at least a decade to construct them."," INS Arighat is India's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.

'Enough is enough': President Murmu on RG Kar rape-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enough-is-enough-prez-on-rg-kar-rape-murder/articleshow/112878752.cms,"Must help women win

, says Murmu

NEW DELHI: In a rare intervention, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday spoke out against a series of brutal rapes across the country and called for ""honest self-introspection"" to go to the root of the ""malaise"".""The gruesome rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata has left the nation shocked. I was dismayed and horrified. What's more depressing is...it is part of a series of crimes against women . The victims include even kindergarten girls,"" she said in a signed article for PTI. ""Let us collectively say enough is enough.""Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere. “We owe it to our daughters to remove the hurdles from their path of winning freedom from fear,” Prez Murmu said.The President lamented the pattern of episodic outrage against atrocities like the Nirbhaya rape case only to develop “collective amnesia” until jolted into a furious response by another gruesome crime against women.Recalling the Nirbhaya incident, which generated “shock and awe”, the President said, “We were determined not to let another Nirbhaya meet the same fate. We made plans and devised strategies. These initiatives did make a difference to an extent. Yet, our task remains unfinished as long as any woman feels unsafe in the environment where she lives or works.” She said “collective amnesia” about the gruesome incidents was as “obnoxious” as the mindset of some. “I am of the firm belief that we should not let amnesia prevail over the memory of such criminality. Let us deal with this perversion in a comprehensive manner so as to curb it right at the beginning. We can do this only if we honour the memory of the victims by cultivating a social culture of remembering them to remind us of our failures in the past and prepare us to be more vigilant in future,” Murmu said. She also sought to address underlying causes such as the “objectification of women by a few” which, she said, allowed crimes against women to keep happening despite the enactment of tough laws.“Countering this mindset is a task for both the state and society. In India, over the years, the two have fought hard to change the wrong attitude. There have been laws and there have been social campaigns. Yet, there is something that continues to come in the way and to torment us,” she said.BJP on Wednesday said President Droupadi Murmu’s remarks on crimes against women reflect the gravity of the issue and it’s time to rise above party politics and ensure that justice is done in such cases.The party’s reaction came after Murmu, in an article for PTI, spoke out for the first time on the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata and expressed her anguish at continuing crimes against women.","President Droupadi Murmu spoke out against a series of brutal rapes across the country.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to create plug-and-play infrastructure for industry to set up factories, the cabinet committee on economic affairs Wednesday cleared 12 new industrial cities with an investment of Rs 28,600 crore, with the largest one, spread over 6,000 acre, to come up near Dighi port in poll-bound Maharashtra.At least three of these proposed cities are in states governed by NDA allies: Gaya in Bihar, and Orvakal & Kopparthy in Andhra.Another two are in BJP-governed UP (Agra, Prayagraj), besides in Uttarakhand (Khurpia), and Rajasthan (Jodhpur Pali Marwar).Among the opposition-governed states, Punjab (Rajpura Patiala), Kerala (Palakkad) and Telangana (Zaheerabad) have been allotted one project each. The 12th project was not named, with Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw citing model code of conduct in force for assembly polls.“These projects have potential to generate investment of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore. But the estimates are conservative,” said commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, adding that a little under 10 lakh jobs will be created. Though earlier projects have taken longer to develop, he said basic infrastructure in the new ones will be developed in three years given that states are ready with land and environmental clearances. “Centre and state govt will set up a special purpose vehicle, with the states providing land, which is treated as its share of equity, and Union govt providing equivalent amount of cash.","Cabinet committee on economic affairs clears 12 new industrial cities with an investment of Rs 28,600 crore.

He said they posed a risk to his safety.In Guwahati, Sarma said a woman was seen with the two cops in the same hotel, suggesting she was part of the alleged honeytrap conspiracy.
