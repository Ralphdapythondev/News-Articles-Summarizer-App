OBC Creamy Layer: OBC Creamy Layer Income Cap Revision Status and Controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/obc-creamy-layer-income-cap-revision-status-and-controversy/articleshow/111738531.cms,"NEW DELHI: The controversy about alleged misrepresentation of ‘non-creamy layer’ certificate by trainee IAS Pooja Khedkar has cast a cloud over the ‘ OBC creamy layer ’ criteria and its implementation. But the irony is that genuine backward aspirants are getting a rough deal and desperately hoping that the new BJP govt will finally wake up to the long pending revision of ‘creamy layer’ for Mandal reservations.The increase in ‘ income ceiling ’ for 27% OBC quotas is pending for seven years, which has made it twice overdue for a hike. It is supposed to be revised every three years to adjust for inflation. The ‘creamy layer’, last revised from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh in 2017, is the group of backwards who are categorised as well-off among the OBCs and thus ineligible for job and education quotas.All India OBC Employees Federation general secretary G Karunanidhy said during the seven years, the Union govt has revised the salary structure of its employees and increased their dearness allowance (DA) from 24% to 46% till July 2023, and ignoring these indexes for income ceiling for reservation is unjustified. “The new central govt has settled in. We demand immediate revision of income ceiling for creamy layer to Rs 15 lakh,” he said.When the income ceiling was due for an increase in 2020, the Union social justice ministry moved a cabinet proposal recommending it be hiked from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, but added a separate point to redefine the ‘income criteria’ for the ‘creamy layer’. As laid down by the post-Mandal 1993 office memorandum, ‘income’ does not include ‘salary’ and ‘agricultural earnings’, but govt proposed that in future ‘salary’ be included in calculating ‘income’.The proposal ran into resistance from the National Commission for Backward Classes and senior OBC leaders of BJP, who argued that inclusion of ‘salary’ in calculating the ‘creamy layer’ would make it easier for a backward to be considered better-off. A surprised Modi govt was forced to put the proposal in cold storage.The deadlock dragged on for three years and in Sept 2023, the revision became due again. Meanwhile, the social justice minister told the Lok Sabha on Feb 7, 2023, that there was no proposal for revision “since the existing income limit is considered sufficient”, triggering outrage among the backwards.Now, with two hikes overdue, social justice activists like Karunanidhy, who have sent several letters to govt, complain it has become much easier for an OBC to be weeded out of eligibility for reservations because Rs 8 lakh is too low a ceiling in 2024, seven years after it was determined.","The increase in ‘ income ceiling ’ for 27% OBC quotas is pending for seven years.

Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them.

We've seen attacks on Shinzo Abe, then Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, and now Donald Trump. The threat is real. Vile global Left networks are at work, demonising popular and powerful leaders, plotting to bring them down so that they can control elected governments and stamp their hegemony.""On October 27, 2013, as PM Modi stood on stage at the ‘Hunkar Rally’ in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, bombs exploded. Six people were killed, and in 2021, nine terrorists were convicted for the attacks, with four receiving death sentences. The blasts occurred between 11:40 am and 12:45 pm. Investigations revealed that the terrorists initially planned to assassinate PM Modi with a suicide bomber but opted for bomb explosions to cause a stampede, providing a chance to target PM Modi in the chaos.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) found that the accused had conducted reconnaissance of PM Modi’s rallies across the country and concluded that attacking PM Modi with firearms was nearly impossible due to his tight security. According to the NIA's charge sheet, ""They decided to explode IEDs at the election rally in Patna, intending to kill many people, causing a stampede in which Modi could be targeted from close range.""A special NIA court held nine members of the banned terror outfit SIMI guilty of the 2013 serial blasts that killed six people and injured 89 at PM Modi's rally. One of the ten accused, Fakkruddin, was acquitted due to lack of evidence. The court of additional district and sessions judge Gurvinder Singh Malhotra will pronounce the sentences on November 1. Special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha said the NIA would seek capital punishment for at least five of the nine convicts.Five of the convicts – Haider Ali (alias Black Beauty), Imtiaz Ansari, Umer Siddique, Azharuddin Qureshi, and Mujibullah Ansari – are already serving life terms for the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi blasts three months before the Patna attack. The other four convicts are Numan Ansari, Ahmad Hussain, Mohammad Feroz Aslam, and Mohammad Ifteqaar Alam. One of the original 12 accused had been convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board, Patna.""The original plan was to assassinate PM Modi through suicide bombing, but the terrorists gave up that plan after a recce showed that his fortress-like security cover would be hard to penetrate,"" the special public prosecutor said. PM Modi was then the chief minister of Gujarat.The NIA discovered that the terrorists detonated a suicide vest tied to a palm tree in Ranchi's Sithiyo area while preparing for the serial blasts. The conspiracy unraveled with the arrest of Imtiaz, who was injured during an accidental blast at Patna railway junction on the day of PM Modi's rally. Another suspected SIMI terrorist, Tariq Ajam Ansari, was killed while inserting a pencil battery into an IED inside a public toilet on platform number 10 of the station. Three IEDs were defused at the rally venue later.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a news article and said, ""Never forget: When Narendra Modi was the prime ministerial candidate in 2013, six blasts went off during his rally in Patna. The terrorists had originally planned to assassinate PM Modi using a suicide bomber."" On October 27, 2013, as PM Modi stood on stage at the ‘Hunkar Rally’ inPatna’s Gandhi Maidan, bombs exploded. Six people were killed, and in 2021, nine terrorists were convicted for the attacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111727514,imgsize-1107671,width-400,resizemode-4/111727514.jpg"

TOI

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere. Eventually, however, they could not secure an appointment after having failed the test,” the functionary told",Pooja Khedkar is in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services.

NEW DELHI: In more trouble for IAS probationary officer Puja Khedkar , Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials have issued a notice of illegal encroachment at her residence. According to the PMC's Encroachment Department, Khedkar's residence had unauthorised construction or obstructions on public roads or footpaths under the corporation's jurisdiction.While the details of Khedkar's specific case are not publicly known, the PMC's encroachment removal process typically involves issuing notices, conducting surveys, and ultimately demolishing or clearing the illegal structures if the owner fails to comply.Khedkar has found herself in the middle of a massive controversy over alleged misuse of power and privileges.Officials said all documents presented by her to secure her candidature in the civil services examination and then for selection in the service will be re-examined by a single-member committee constituted by the Centre on Thursday.She may be terminated from service if found guilty, said officials.""The officer may be terminated from the service if found guilty.

There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?...

Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law. Even for the person to discharge the burden statutorily imposed on him by virtue of Section 9 of the Act, the person has to be intimated of the information and material available against him, such that he/she can contest and defend the proceedings against him,""the court said.","Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner.

PUNE: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , embroiled in a controversy over the legitimacy of her certificates, secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category furnishing a non-creamy layer OBC certificate, college director Arvind Bhore said Saturday.Khedkar gained admission through the Association of Management of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges of Maharashtra (AMUPMDC) entrance test, scoring 146 out of 200, said Bhore. AMUPMDC no longer exists after NEET’s introduction.Khedkar is under multiple investigations for submitting a non-creamy layer certificate to UPSC, despite owning properties worth at least Rs 17 crore, including family gifts. Her selection under the benchmark disabilities category is also under review.According to Bhore, it was the medical college’s first batch when Khedkar joined. “Khedkar had also attempted the Maharashtra common entrance test for medical admissions. But her AMUPMDC score was higher than the state CET. She had provided a non-creamy layer certificate of the NT-3 category of the Vanjari community at the time of admission. We checked all the documents at the time of submission and found them to be authentic govt records,” Bhore said.Khedkar’s non-creamy layer certificate was issued by Pathardi sub-divisional office in Ahmednagar in 2007. Her caste and validity certificates were also issued by the same office, according to college records. Bhore mentioned she did not submit any disability certificate at the time of admission.When TOI contacted Khedkar, her cellphone was switched off. She also hadn’t responded to text messages till the time of going to press.College records indicate Khedkar scored 83% in Class 10 and 74% in Class 12 state board exams. She earned her MBBS degree in 2011-12 after completing academics and internship at Navale College. During her internship, she was stationed at the community medicine department.“Her conduct was fine and she passed all her semesters with ease while her internship at the hospital was also completed on time,” Bhore said.","Pooja Khedkar secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category.

This is in addition to Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United)'s demand to accord 'special category' status to one of the most backward states in the country, something that the Bihar chief minister is unrelenting on despite BJP ministers maintaining that this kind of a dispensation is no longer possible.JD(U) functionaries said rules can be tweaked to address a long-pending concern of the state, especially after the creation of Jharkhand more than two decades ago.""It is within the realm of powers of any govt to devise policies to address the imbalance,"" a party source told TOI.While Andhra Pradesh too had similar demands, CM Chandrababu Naidu is now seeking specific projects and a package for the backward regions of the state which too was bifurcated to create Telangana. He gave a long list of projects from an oil refinery to a push for petrochemicals when he recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top Union ministers.The special status issue flagged by two major constituents of NDA will be dealt with by the 16th Finance Commission chaired by economist Arvind Panagariya when it presents its report towards the end of 2025 as several other states have been demanding the tag as well.For the time being, Bihar govt has sought finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's intervention to deal with the flood problem especially because it involves Nepal. Any restriction of flow of water will have to be dealt with bilaterally with the neighbouring country, but the state govt's proposals are meant to build infrastructure to address the issue domestically, as far as possible, a source familiar with the discussions told TOI. The state govt is hoping for some announcements in the Budget.Along with infrastructure-related proposals, the state has also asked for support in centrally sponsored schemes, suggesting that the Centre should take over the state's contribution as well. Bihar, however, is focused on driving the best bargain given the current political situation at the Centre with representatives from BJP as well as JD(U) knocking on the Centre's doors.JD(U) is studying Naidu's proposals and is expected to have a more detailed wish list in the months ahead with party representatives suggesting that the coalition with BJP is a long-term partnership and everything cannot be delivered through one Budget.",Bihar government has approached the Centre with a demand to announce flood mitigation measures.

Out of 1,000 CUET-UG aspirants for whom National Testing Agency (NTA) is conducting a retest on July 19, 250 candidates are from Oasis Public School in Hazaribag. According to NTA sources, the retest is necessary due to the distribution of question papers in a language not chosen by the candidates and issues with ""missing data"" for some aspirants.The agency announced the retest schedule on Sunday but did not address the delay in the results, which are already over two weeks late. The final answer key has also not been released.

The re-examination will be conducted for the affected candidates on July 19 in computer-based test mode.The public notice did not specify the number of candidates or the nature of the grievances.

According to NTA sources, the ""1,000 candidates are spread across six states, and some grievances include time lost due to the distribution of the wrong question paper.""The distribution of incorrect question papers also occurred during the NEET-UG exam on May 5, leading NTA to grant grace marks for the lost time. However, following opposition and pleas in Supreme Court against the inflation of marks, NTA withdrew the results and announced retest for 1,563 candidates, 813 of whom attended the exam on June 23.Sources also mentioned that NTA has not been able to retrieve data for some candidates. ""Some data are missing, so these candidates will have to take the test again on July 19"", said the source, without revealing how the data was misplaced.This raises questions about how long NTA will take to release the results. Initially scheduled for June 30, the results were delayed due to the paper leak allegations involving NEET-UG, and UGC-NET. On July 7, the agency released the provisional answer key for CUET-UG 2024, indicating a retest for candidates if grievances were validated. ""Initially, it was decided to announce the results for the remaining candidates before the retest, and subsequently for the rest.
