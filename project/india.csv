PM Modi may meet Iranian president in Russia amid escalating West Asia tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-may-meet-iranian-president-in-russia-amid-escalating-west-asia-tensions/articleshow/114410136.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian

Amid escalating Israel-Iran tensions, India and Iran remain in touch diplomatically to finalise a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia ’s Kazan this week.If it happens, it will be the first bilateral meeting between the 2 leaders since the reformist president assumed office in July this year.The troubled West Asia situation is expected to figure prominently at the summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin having invited Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas to take part in the meeting.Iran remains closely aligned with Russia on regional and global issues and is also looking to sign a strategic partnership with Moscow during the visit of the president for BRICS. Israel has incapacitated Iran’s allies Hamas and Hezbollah with targeted killings of their top leaders. Iran launched a missile attack on Israel in response on October 1 and the threat of retaliatory strikes by Israel still looms over the region. Speaking about the BRICS summit on Friday, Putin offered to mediate, if asked, and help both sides reach a compromise.Modi had congratulated Pezeshkian on his election as president in July, saying he was looking forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the “warm and long-standing’’ bilateral relationship for the benefit of the people and the region. Logistical constraints prevented a meeting between the leaders at the UNGA last month. If the meeting does take place, Modi can be expected to express concern over loss of civilian lives, seek Gaza ceasefire and underscore the need to prevent the conflict from spilling over into the West Asia region, while also condemning terrorism.Modi had conveyed a similar message to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he spoke to him last month, days after he met Abbas at the UNGA, while backing Israel on the issue of terrorism. India’s tough balancing act is driven by the need to keep its relations with both Israel and Palestine on an even keel.Interestingly, at the BRICS foreign ministers’ meeting this year in Russia, which took place days after the Modi government was sworn in, India joined other member-states in condemning Israel’s military operation in Rafah and in expressing serious concern at Israel’s “continued blatant disregard of international law, the UN Charter, UN resolutions and Court orders”. However, India last month abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution demanding an end to Israel’s “unlawful presence’’ in occupied Palestinian territory that was adopted with 124 votes in favour.","India and Iran remain in touch diplomatically to finalise a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.

Just 6 big states account for 55% of road fatalities in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-6-big-states-account-for-55-of-road-fatalities-in-2023/articleshow/114408275.cms,"AI Image/Lexica.art

NEW DELHI: Only six large states - Uttar Pradesh , Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra , Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - accounted for nearly 55 per cent of the 1,73,000 road deaths in the country last year. Among them, Rajasthan saw the sharpest increase in fatalities, with an almost 6 per cent rise compared to 2022, according to data shared by state govts with Centre.The six states registered 95,246 road deaths in 2023 compared to 91,936 in the preceding year, data shows.Though the reports on road crashes and deaths are yet to be published by road transport ministry and National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the home ministry, the trend shows how the problem is getting bigger, despite India's global commitment to reduce these fatalities by half in the next six years.""Focussed efforts, proper investigation into accidents and designing interventions can bring down road deaths. That's what I had realised in my stint while dealing with Delhi's traffic issues. Most of the crashes and fatalities are preventable,"" said former IPS officer Satyendra Garg, who was joint commissioner (traffic) in Delhi.Experts said govt authorities need to come out of the mindset that big states would have higher share of fatalities as they have more roads and vehicles as well, to deal with this ""man-made crisis"". Naresh Raghavan, an road safety expert and author of driving manuals, said there is a greater need to focus on driver education along with enforcement of laws. ""Remember, only five or six rules can be policed or enforced. For the remaining 45 basic road rules have to be taught to people/drivers,"" he added.Raising concerns over the rising number of road deaths, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday urged officials and engineers to investigate all fatal crashes to find reasons and take corrective measures.""We lost 1.73 lakh lives in road accidents last year and remember nearly 60% of people killed every year are in the age group of 18-34 years. The socio-economic cost of road accidents is around 3% of our GDP. Please take it seriously. Deal with road safety issues with sensitivity, investigate accidents, fix black spots and address issues. We have never lost so many people even in wars,"" he had said while addressing a conference on emerging trends and technologies in road and bridge construction.","Rajasthan saw the sharpest increase in fatalities, with an almost 6 per cent rise compared to 2022.

NEW DELHI: In December 2020, Enforcement Directorate arrested KA Rauf Sherif, the general secretary of the Campus Front of India (CFI). That was the beginning of a multi-agency probe against the Popular Front of India (PFI) to unearth its entire network and source of finance.A dossier prepared by ED after a four-year probe revealed PFI has hundreds of enlisted members and offices across Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, J&K, and Manipur.The outfit, which was proscribed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2022 after a failed attempt on PM Modi's life in July that year, has at least 13,000 members in Singapore and five Gulf countries, from where funds are generated in cash from 'unknown donors' and sent to India through hawala , according to the ED dossier.Cash was then deposited in 29 bank accounts of trusts and affiliated entities. Agencies have arrested 26 of its top office bearers and seized properties and bank accounts in India and abroad over the last few years. A terrorist camp was also unearthed in Kerala. The dossier said the outfit was behind the Delhi riots, the unrest in Hathras, and an attempt on the life of PM Modi during his rally in Patna in July 2022. Prominent among those arrested since 2020 include Rauf Sherif, CFI national general secretary; Shafeeque Payeth, a PFI member based in Qatar; Perwez Ahmed, president of Delhi PFI; and Sahul Hameed, dealing in hawala for PFI from Singapore. . ""Real objectives of PFI include carrying out an Islamic movement in India through jihad, though PFI masquerades itself as a social movement. Evidence reveals that the methods of protest employed by them are violent in nature,"" ED said.The agency said an arms training camp in Narath in Kerala's Kannur district was found, and there, PFI was training cadres in use of explosives and weapons under the garb of physical education classes.So far, the money trail has led to revelations of a collection of more than Rs 94 crore by PFI and its affiliates. ED has attached 35 properties worth Rs 57 crore dubbing them as 'proceeds of crime'. The outfit has been found active in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE from where most of its funds are generated.""PFI has formed well defined district executive committees for the non-resident Muslim diaspora living in Gulf countries. It has been collecting money in India and abroad, and using it for terror activities in the country,"" the agency said.","The Popular Front of India (PFI) has at least 13,000 members in Singapore and five Gulf countries.

We fulfilled the promise of women's reservation, liberated Muslim daughters from social evils like triple talaq, and gave constitutional status to the OBC commission with 10% reservation for the poor.""Accusing Congress and SP of having neglected Varanasi for years, Modi said, ""Why did the colourful cultural city, Kashi, which houses the sacred Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva, salvation site of Manikarnika, and knowledge site of Sarnath, remain deprived of development and neglected for decades?""Those who governed UP and Delhi for long never cared for Varanasi due to dynastic and appeasement politics, Modi said.He recalled his Independence Day speech to bring one lakh youths with no political background into politics to change Indian politics, eradicate corruption and nepotism.

IMA chief calls for legalising prenatal gender detection tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ima-chief-calls-for-legalising-prenatal-gender-detection-tests/articleshow/114408224.cms,"Representative image

PANAJI: Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr RV Asokan called for the legalisation of prenatal gender determination tests, arguing Sunday that the current ban has not substantially impacted India's skewed sex ratio in three decades.Prenatal gender determination and sex-selective abortions have been illegal in India under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act since 1994, aimed at curbing female foeticide and improving the sex ratio.However, Asokan questioned the effectiveness of the law. ""After 30 years, what has this law produced? Has it reversed the sex ratio? Not a significant impact. In some places, there may have been (an impact),"" he said in Goa, where he attended the golden jubilee celebrations of IMA's Ponda branch.India's sex ratio has shown gradual improvement over the years, rising from 927 females per 1,000 males in 1991 to 943 females per 1,000 males in 2011, according to census data. However, Asokan emphasised that the issue remains persistent and suggested that legalising gender detection could help protect unborn girls by ensuring they are carried to full term.""IMA's central working committee is advocating for sex detection and child protection,"" Asokan said. ""We are demanding sex detection and protection of (the unborn) child...tag the child...carry that child to delivery. If anything untoward occurs, then hold people accountable. It's possible as technology is available.""The IMA president also argued that the current ban has led to the unnecessary targeting of ultrasound machines and medical professionals.",Prenatal gender determination and sex-selective abortions have been illegal in India since 1994.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI/KOLKATA: Indian carriers continued to grapple with a wave of bomb hoax threats for the sixth straight day, disrupting flight schedules and causing inconvenience during the busy festive travel season. More than 20 flights received threats Sunday — albeit lower than the single day’s highest of at least 40 flights Saturday.The pattern of threats that began Monday has so far affected nearly 90 flights.Most of the affected flights originated from major hubs such as Mumbai and New Delhi, leading to extensive security checks , delays, and operational challenges.Smaller airports like the one in Karnataka’s Belagavi were also targeted. It received a threat via email, but was declared a hoax after a detailed search of the premises. In Kolkata, the airport operations control centre received a bomb threat for an Alliance Air flight while it was mid-air. Flight 9I 0752, which departed from Lakhimpur in Assam, was just 12 minutes away from Kolkata with 73 passengers on board when the threat was received.Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has urged operators to strictly follow standard operating procedures. Initial investigations suggest many of the messages were sent through virtual private networks or dark web browsers.According to an official, the scale and frequency of the threats differ from earlier hoax calls, which were often made by passengers looking to delay their flights. “Given the number of threats, this could be part of a larger conspiracy to flood the industry with such messages so that one becomes lax. But we take every threat seriously,” the official said.(Inputs from Bengaluru)",The pattern of threats that began Monday has so far affected nearly 90 flights.

Kashmir: Biggest Attack Of 2024 Along Ladakh Highway; 7 Killed, 5 Injured Near Sonamarg

SRINAGAR: Suspected Pakistani terrorists shot dead six workers and a doctor in the biggest targeted attack on construction employees in more than three decades of violence in J&K — firing automatic weapons around 8.15 pm Sunday at a camp of a private company building a tunnel in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district .The fatalities included Dr Shahnawaz from Budgam in central Kashmir; Gurmeet Singh (30) from Punjab’s Gurdaspur, Inder Yadav (35) from Bihar; Mohan Lal (30) and Jagtar Singh (30) from Kathua in Jammu; Fayaz Ahmad Lone (26) and Zahoor Ahmad Lone from Kashmir.Several others were wounded in the fifth targeted attack in Kashmir this year and the second since the new coalition government led by CM Omar Abdullah assumed office in J&K on October 16.The attack was also the biggest in terms of fatalities in Kashmir this year, underscoring the disturbing trend of terrorists targeting civilians after the June 9 shooting at a pilgrim bus in Reasi district of Jammu region. Seven pilgrims, the driver, and the conductor died, while 41 others were wounded that day.Omar, who represents Ganderbal assembly constituency, posted on X: “Very sad news of a dastardly and cowardly attack on non-local labourers… The casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local & non-local.”Sources said the camp was near the construction site of Apco Infratech , a UP-based firm building the 6.5 km Z-Morh tunnel for all-weather connectivity between Gagangir and the tourist hub of Sonamarg. The highway connects Kashmir valley with Ladakh. The project is slated to be inaugurated in the first week of November.Union home minister Amit Shah condemned the killings and promised that those “involved in this heinous act will not be spared and will face the harshest response from our security forces”. “At this moment of immense grief, I extend my sincerest condolences to the families of the deceased. Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he posted on X.Highways minister Nitin Gadkari also condemned the terrorist attack, saying the “innocent labourers” were engaged in a vital infrastructure project in Gagangir. “I offer my humble tribute to the martyred labourers and extend my deepest condolences to their families during this difficult time.”So far, seven migrant workers have been killed in Kashmir this year. On Friday, the body of a 30-year-old man from Bihar’s Banka district was found riddled with bullets in a maize field in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. On April 8, a tourist cab driver from Delhi was critically wounded in Shopian, while a 35-year-old labourer from Bihar was shot dead in Anantnag on April 17. Earlier in February, two men from Punjab were killed in Srinagar.Sources said the doctor and two workers died on the spot, while the others were rushed to a nearby hospital, where four more were pronounced dead. Five of the critically wounded were shifted to SKIMS hospital in Srinagar.The Union territory recorded a surge in terrorist violence this summer, with 22 security fatalities since May 4 — 18 in Jammu and four in Kashmir. Speaking on the security situation, Army’s 15 Corps GoC Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai said around 80 terrorists are active in the region.","Suspected Pakistani terrorists shot dead six workers and a doctor in the biggest targeted attack on construction employees in more than three decades of violence in J&K. The fatalities included Dr Shahnawaz from Budgam in central Kashmir; Gurmeet Singh (30) from Punjab’s Gurdaspur, Inder Yadav (35) from Bihar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114404530,imgsize-506207,width-400,resizemode-4/114404530.jpg"
'Trudeau destroyed Canada-India ties based on ...': Outgoing envoy Sanjay Verma slams baseless Nijjar allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trudeau-destroyed-canada-india-ties-based-on-envoy-sanjay-verma-slams-baseless-nijjar-allegations/articleshow/114400912.cms,"India- Canada diplomatic row

Baseless and politically motivated: MEA

Accused India based on intelligence: Trudeau

India rejects Trudeau's statements

NEW DELHI: India's outgoing High Commissioner to Canada , Sanjay Kumar Verma , who was recalled by New Delhi last week, has denied any involvement in the killing of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , adding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has destroyed bilateral political relations between the two nations.In an exclusive interview to CTV News, Verma explicitly condemned Nijjar's killing, stating: ""Any murder is wrong and bad.I do condemn it and that is what I have said in many interviews.""When questioned if he had anything to do with Nijjar's killing, the envoy said: ""Nothing at all. No evidence was presented [by Canada]. (This is) politically motivated.""In the interview with host Vassy Kapelos on CTV that aired on Sunday, Verma asserted that Trudeau's decision to balme India for Nijjar's killing was based on intelligence information rather than concrete evidence.""On the basis of intelligence, if you want to destroy a relationship, be my guest. And that's what he [Trudeau] did,"" Verma added.In response to a question from Kapelos regarding Canada's allegations that diplomats and Indian government officials are allegedly involved in coercing cooperation and information from South East Asians living in Canada, Verma asserted that the process is entirely transparent.""There is nothing covert. It's all overt ... we read the newspapers, we read their statements, since we understand Punjabi. So we read their social media posts, and try to infer from there,"" said Verma.The envoy also firmly denied any personal involvement in such activities, stating, ""I, as High Commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind.""He further emphasised the importance of staying informed about the actions of pro-Khalistani groups in Canada, as it aligns with India's national interests.When Kapelos asked whether the Indian government has ever targeted specific individuals with the intent of causing their death, Verma responded: ""Never"".Verma's remarks come on the heels of accusations made by the RCMP and the Canadian federal government, alleging that Indian diplomats and consular officials stationed in Canada have been engaging in covert activities connected to serious criminal offenses in the country, including homicides and extortions.When questioned by Kapelos about whether India's explanation leaves ""Canadians with the impression that (the Indian) government does have something to hide,"" Verma insisted ""absolutely not"".""In fact, we have been asking for (evidence) for the last one year, which the RCMP has also said ... And then if you do not share with us the reason for your visit, how do we know?"" said Verma.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar's killing in British Columbia in June last year.India labelled the claims as ""absurd"" and part of a broader political move by Trudeau to appeal to the pro-Khalistani vote.Canada is home to the world's largest Sikh population outside of Punjab and demonstrations advocating for the creation of a separate Sikh homeland within India have caused tension between the two nations.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation.In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler.The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism.India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) labeled the allegations as baseless and politically motivated, suggesting they stem from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's domestic agenda. The MEA noted that Trudeau's ""hostility towards India"" has been evident for some time.""The government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centred around vote bank politics,"" the MEA said in a statement.""Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters,"" it added.The MEA referred to past events as a reminder of the strained ties between the two nations, worsened by what India sees as Trudeau's repeated interference in its internal affairs.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, has acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar's assassination last year.Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time.""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point,"" he said, adding: ""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was ... give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said let's work together.""India rejected Trudeau's statements, with MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, ""What we have heard only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along — Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations it has levelled against India and Indian diplomats."" Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau's responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.","India's outgoing High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma has denied any involvement in the killing of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

MUMBAI: Crucial meetings of the AICC's central election and screening committees scheduled for Sunday were abruptly cancelled owing to a lack of consensus on MVA's seat-sharing formula. These panels will meet in a day or two.According to a Congress office-bearer, the party is prepared for any eventuality if there is no agreement on seat sharing. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut has echoed a similar sentiment, saying anything can happen in politics.Seat sharing talks had resumed late on Saturday after AICC's Maharashtra in-charge Ramesh Chennithala met Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar to defuse the situation. Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray , along with Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab, too, met Pawar. Sena (UBT) functionaries said this meeting was to discuss the MVA manifesto, but political observers noted that the tiff over seats hasn't been fully resolved, especially between Sena (UBT) and Congress. On Sunday, Uddhav also called for a meeting of party functionaries at Matoshree, the Thackerays' residence, but no candidate list was declared by any MVA party.Since no solution had been found when its committees' members met on Sunday, AICC deployed former minister and CWC member Naseem Khan to meet Pawar to resolve the dispute. ""I had a brief meeting with Sharad Pawar on the disputed seats. Since he is an architect of MVA, he spoke to both Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut. I am sure following the intervention of Sharad Pawar, the dispute will be resolved soon,"" he told TOI.Recently, Congress had reviewed all assembly seats and identified 288 nominees.MVA constituents had met on seven occasions in recent times.

NEW DELHI: Scarred by the Haryana debacle, Congress now is focusing on the "" rebel factor "" in the ensuing Maharashtra polls .Sources said the appointment of senior leaders as observers in each region of the state is for the primary objective of controlling disappointed ticket aspirants from turning rebels, and persuade them to stay loyal with the promise of future accommodation.The party managers appointed as observers will be given the specific brief to focus on reining in members who may want to challenge the official party nominees.While Congress appoints special observers in every election, those named for Maharashtra are known members with vast experience and also a robust social profile. Besides, two or three observers have been appointed for each of the five regions - like Ashok Gehlot and Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara for Mumbai/Konkan region, former CMs Bhupesh Baghel and Charanjit Singh Channi, and leader of opposition in MP Umang Singhar for Vidarbha, Sachin Pilot and senior Telangana minister Uttam Reddy for Marathwada, among others. The party has also appointed AICC office-bearers with local roots - Mukul Wasnik and Avinash Pande - as senior coordinators.A Congress manager said the ""concern"" about rebels is compounded by the fact that ticket aspirants who lose out in the final decision, are easy targets for rivals, who provoke them and even sponsor them into taking the plunge to damage Congress.Much to its woes, Congress found that rebels damaged the prospects of official candidates in key constituencies in Haryana. Thus, the party is paying special attention to this part of micro-management after the shock defeat, as it moves to the crucial contest in Maharashtra.

BAHRAICH/LUCKNOW: Riot-scarred Maharajganj in UP's Bahraich had an air of resignation to it Sunday as villagers scrambled to salvage whatever they could from their homes and shops, with some voluntarily pulling down portions of their properties marked for demolition by PWD at the end of the initial three-day notice period.Traders hurriedly emptied their shops and tin sheds lay dismantled in a sign of fear hammering down on the neighbourhood of Abdul Hameed - he and three of his sons are suspects in the murder of Ram Gopal Mishra during the October 13 flare-up - well before the bulldozers were to roll in.Notices had been served on 23 homes and shops to vacate the portions of government land they had allegedly encroached by Sunday evening.Hameed's property was among those notified for demolition on Oct 18, five days after that part of Bahraich erupted in communal violence originating from an attack on a Durga Puja immersion procession over the revellers purportedly playing loud music.A senior PWD official said the encroachments were along Kundaasur-Mahsi-Nanpara road in Maharajganj's commercial hub. ""We mentioned in the notice that any construction within 60 feet of the centre of a main road in rural areas without prior approval from PWD is illegal.""According to the notice, owners of all such properties can submit original copies of prior approval from the Bahraich DM or any other authority to the department to save these from demolition.The official said the department had issued notices last year, too, mentioning that encroachment on a road like the Kundasar-Mahsi-Nanpara link causes traffic congestion and delays movement of essential goods to other districts.Station house officer K S Chaturvedi of Hardi police station said Hameed's shop, which stands on the roadside adjacent to his house, was about 40 feet from the middle of the thoroughfare.Another resident in the shop beside Hameed's said he complied with the notice, pulling down an extended shed.Some of the other traders who received notices conceded that they may have encroached on government land, but questioned why those on the opposite side of the road weren't being targeted. Of the 23 residents whose properties are red-listed, three are Hindus - siblings Moon, Nankau and Pappu. They are Hameed's neighbours.","Notices served on 23 homes and shops to vacate portions of government land in Maharajganj. Abdul Hameed's property was among those notified for demolition on Oct 18.

Trudeau himself admitted there’s no evidence: Ex-envoy

NEW DELHI: Describing the charges against him as ""politically motivated"", outgoing Indian high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma accused Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of destroying the India-Canada political relations.He said Canada was acting on the basis of intel, not evidence, adding Ottawa was only encouraging Khalistan extremists , who were working for Canadian intelligence authorities.Canada last week claimed to have expelled Verma for alleged role in criminal activities.While Canada last week claimed to have expelled Sanjay Verma and five other Indian diplomats for alleged role in criminal activities, India had said it had recalled Verma and others. In a retaliatory action, India had expelled six Canadian diplomats too. “He (Justin Trudeau) himself admitted there was no evidence. On the basis of intelligence, if you want to destroy a relationship, be my guest. And that’s what he did,” Verma told Canada’s CTV in an interview Sunday, before his departure to India. Asked about extra-judicial killings, Verma said India has never done it but some G7 countries have and there shouldn’t be “double standards” about it. On whether he had had anything to do with Nijjar’s murder, Verma said, “Nothing at all. No evidence was presented. It’s politically motivated.”Verma said Canada didn’t follow the usual practice of sharing evidence first. “Evidence should have been shared first, but someone (Trudeau) decided to stand in Parliament and talk about a thing for which he himself has said there was no hard evidence,” he said, adding Canada hadn’t done anything to address India’s requests for extradition of 26 individuals involved in terror activities.“The day he did that, since then, he has made sure that bilateral relations with India only go downwards, spiralling down,” he added. According to Verma, the evidence that Canada claims to have is based on hearsay. “I know, for sure, that they go from one person to the other, asking them about the hearsay. Most of them are those who are pro-Khalistan elements, anti-India elements,” he said.Canadian authorities wanted to interrogate Verma and had asked India to consider waiving his diplomatic immunity . “If I am going to be interrogated, I need to see the evidence and know what am I being interrogated for,” said Verma. Asked why Canadian law authorities were not allowed to meet their counterparts and show the evidence they had, he clarified they didn’t follow the “proper procedure” and were late in applying for visas. “They wanted to leave for India on the eighth of October, they gave their completed application form only on the same day,” he said, adding the officials also didn’t mention the agenda for their visit.When asked if Indian govt has ever been involved in the targeting of certain individuals, with an end goal of their death, Verma said. “Never.” He accused the Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly of speaking “politically” and said she had “nothing in her hand”. Verma, according to CTV, also explicitly said he condemns Nijjar’s murder. “Any murder is wrong and bad. I do condemn. Let’s get to the bottom of the issue,” he said, strongly denying allegations that he and other Indian diplomats were collecting information that was used to target Canadian nationals.“I, as High Commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind. That is one,” Verma said. “Second, my colleagues, do we want to know what pro-Khalistani elements in Canada are doing? Yes, we do. That’s my national interest.” On extra-judicial murders, Verma said India will never do it as the largest democracy, but accused some G7 nations of doing it, without naming them.","Outgoing Indian high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma accused Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of destroying India-Canada political relations.

Supreme Court refuses to extend child marriage ban to all faiths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-refuses-to-extend-child-marriage-ban-to-all-faiths/articleshow/114363674.cms,"SC refuses to rule on PCMA as sought by Centre



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) to citizens irrespective of their religion and personal laws but suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.Delivering a 141-page judgment on a PIL highlighting the persistence of child marriages on an alarming scale despite enactment of PCMA 18 years ago, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child marriage under PCMA has been subject of some confusion.”Union govt, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, had in a written note on behalf of WCD ministry submitted that there were conflicting opinions of HCs on precedence of PCMA over personal laws.“SC may consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over the personal law governing marriage,” it requested.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said Centre has not provided details of conflicting judgments from HCs and that PCMA was silent on the validity of child marriages. “Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced on Dec 21, 2021. The bill was referred for examination to department-related standing committee. The bill sought to amend PCMA to expressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The issue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament,” SC said, refraining from ruling as requested by Centre.However, it laid down elaborate guidelines to strengthen measures to prevent child marriages. The CJI-led bench widened the scope of issue before its consideration to bring in betrothal of minors, and said PCMA was silent on this issue. “Marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW stipulates against betrothals of minors,” it said.“Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the JJ Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court bench added.Appreciating efforts of advocate Mugdha, appearing for the NGO ‘Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action’, in bringing to the court’s notice loopholes in implementation of PCMA, the bench said a studied approachby all stakeholders was needed for prevention of child marriages and protection of minors while penalising approach for violation of PCMA should be last resort.",Supreme Court spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) It suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.

NEW DELHI: After its shock defeat in Haryana Congress is faced with the unenviable project of picking its new team of functioanries in the state which will signal that the party has learnt its lessons.Sources said Congress has realised the need to throw the net wide to increase its social appeal , amid repeated evidence that its support base has stagnated to the dominant Jat-Jatav combine , while the rest of the communities - Yadavs, Punjabis and Brahmins, among others - are being polarised against it.The defeat under Bhupinder Hooda has served this reminder, which was known in the past, but was overruled as strategists felt anti-incumbency against the governing BJP, around issues of bread-butter, governance, and aspirations, would trump the social considerations.Sources said Congress will decide on the new team by picking a combination - state president and legislature party leader - which would signal an olive branch to the communities outside the party's base. But two crucial considerations make the final decision a tricky issue.While moving forward to widen the social umbrella, the party does not believe it can simply jettison the old team, lest it disturb the existing support base which, even in the losing cause, brought Congress at par with BJP in vote share and also a healthy tally of 37 seats.And, if the dominant faction agrees for a compromise, the testing dimension would be the need to project functionaries from outside the support base who have their own identity, as against ""proxies"" of the old guard with the fig leaf of being from the desired communities that the party is seeking to woo.",Congress has realised the need to throw the net wide to increase its social appeal.

RANCHI: While the NDA camp has avoided a major inter-party bickering over its seat-sharing formula for the Jharkhand assembly polls , infighting in the INDIA bloc seems to be out in the open. RJD , a junior constituent of the bloc, threatened to go solo but stopped short of breaking up the opposition alliance. Left parties have also upped their ante for a ""respectable"" share of seats.The infighting broke out at a time when nomination of candidates for the first phase of polling scheduled on November 13 has already begun.Even as RJD and Left parties continued to demand ""respectable"" share despite winning only one seat out of the seven it fought in 2019, both JMM and Congress downplayed the development and said they plan to go ahead with their decision to share 70 among themselves and leave 10 seats for RJD and Left.Insiders claimed that Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren has again reached out to RJD supremo Lalu Yadav and executive president Tejashwi Yadav on the issue.RJD, however, set Monday noon as deadline for JMM and Congress to increase and specify seat numbers. RJD said, after the deadline is over, it would announce candidates for 19 seats, considered their stronghold. It, however, would continue to support the bloc's candidates on the remaining 62 seats, RJD's Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Manoj Jha said.""After we expressed displeasure over the seat-sharing announcement, we had a meeting at the CM's residence on Saturday evening, during which we were offered three to four seats. This is unreasonable and unacceptable to our leaders and workers. We are ready to consider about 12 seats,"" he added.Meanwhile, supporters of former minister and senior RJD leader Girinath Singh claimed that he would file his nomination from Garhwa on October 24. JMM's Mithilesh Thakur, who is also a minister in the incumbent Hemant government, represents Garhwa.CPI said they would wait until October 22 for talks with the INDIA bloc, failing which they will name their candidates on 15 out of the 81 assembly seats.Terming the seat-sharing deal announced on Saturday as unilateral, CPI-ML also said they are now in a wait-and-watch mode.Though JMM and Congress were yet to release their list of candidates, sources said JMM would contest 43 to 45 seats while Congress would contest on around 27 seats, according to their initial talks.JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, ""Agreements and disagreements do happen within a family. We will sort it out.""","Infighting in the INDIA bloc seems to be out in the open. RJD threatened to go solo but stopped short of breaking up the opposition alliance.

MUMBAI: The Mahayuti government has added minority pilgrimage centres to CM Tirth Darshan Yojana ahead of the polls. All popular dargahs in and around Mumbai have been added to the list, such as Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai, Haji Malang Dargah in Kalyan, and Diwanshah Dargah in Bhiwandi.Apart from Muslim sites, holy places of Parsis, Buddhists, and Jain community are also included in the list.Under the scheme, state government provides Rs 30,000 per person for darshan of one pilgrimage site for senior citizens aged 60 and above, provided the annual family income does not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh.The decision is being viewed as Mahayuti government's significant minority outreach programme to win them over during the elections. According to government Resolution (GR) issued on Oct 15, government has added 95 holy places from Maharashtra and 15 outside Maharashtra to the scheme.Rais Shaikh , SP legislator from Bhiwandi (E), welcomed the move, but said that it is an election gimmick by the Mahayuti government to win over minorities for their political gains. ""When the scheme was launched in July, I immediately questioned the government as to why not a single holy place for Muslims in Maharashtra was included in this scheme. I wrote a letter to CM Shinde demanding the inclusion of three popular holy places of the Muslim community in the scheme,"" Shaikh said.Shaikh stated that the last-minute additions of the holy places of minority communities expose the government's motive. ""Maharashtra is the land of saints. Sufi saints have many dargahs in the state, which are also visited by Hindus. Notable dargahs like Haji Malang and Haji Ali are in the state. Despite such a rich history, the government didn't include them in the first list, which shows their true nature,"" Shaikh said.In July, Mahayuti government had launched the scheme with 66 holy places of various religions, excluding Muslim community sites, from Maharashtra, along with 73 religious places outside Maharashtra.","The decision is being viewed as Mahayuti government's significant minority outreach programme to win them over during the elections.

""He has been working for the country,"" she said.The US accuses Yadav of directing another Indian citizen, Nikhil Gupta, who it alleges paid a hitman $15,000, to kill Pannun.But in Pranpura, Yadav's cousin pointed to the family's modest, single-storey house, saying, ""Where will so much money come from? Can you see any Audis and Mercedes lined up?"" Most of the village's nearly 500 families have traditionally sent young men to join the security forces, locals said.Yadav's father, who died in 2007, was an officer with India's border force till he died in 2007, and his brother works with the police in Haryana, said Avinash Yadav.Another cousin, Amit Yadav, 41, said Vikash Yadav had been a quiet boy interested in books and athletics and was a national-level marksman. ""Only the Indian government and Vikash know what has happened,"" he said. Avinash Yadav said: ""We want the government to support us, they should tell us what has happened.""","Vikash Yadav, 39, described the claims as false media reports when he spoke to his cousin. US Department of Justice charged Yadav with leading an unsuccessful plot to murder Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun last year. Yadav was an official of Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), according to the indictment unsealed on Thursday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114405001,imgsize-1037764,width-400,resizemode-4/114405001.jpg"
