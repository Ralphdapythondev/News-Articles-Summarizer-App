Gorakhpur is still struggling with waterlogging, unemployment and traffic jams. What have you done to resolve them as the MP?

Opposition calls you an ‘outsider’ here. What do you have to say about it? Also, it is alleged that since you come from the film industry you give more time to Mumbai than Gorakhpur?

How will BJP fare in Purvanchal this time? In the last polls, BJP failed to make a clean sweep despite ‘Modi wave’ in 2019 and could win 18 of the 27 seats. Will BJP win all 80 seats in UP?

You are among BJP’s star campaigners. Tell us how this election is different for you than 2019

Last time it was SP-BSP alliance and this time it’s INDIA bloc. Will it pose a challenge to you and the party?

What win margin are you aiming for? How many seats will BJP win in UP and the country?

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician and sitting MP Ravi Kishan , who is seeking re-election from Gorakhpur , felt that the dignity of polls has been lowered by the opposition’s personal attack on PM and says that BJP will secure a landslide victory banking on the works done by PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath. He adds that the INDIA bloc is nothing but ‘26 logon ka ek immature dal’ which will disintegrate as soon as the poll results are announced. In a chat with TOI’s Mohita Tewari, he spoke about his poll prospects and priorities. Excerpts:It’s my dream to set up a regional film city in Gorakhpur like the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune. I am a student of cinema and the one who set up a new film (Bhojpuri) industry in Mumbai. I had given employment to around one lakh people in Mumbai. I know how to generate employment with the help of cinema. I want to end the struggle of lakhs of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar children who want to make their career in this field. They will learn the art in their state and won’t have to struggle in Mumbai.We have invested over Rs 1,000 crore to solve the waterlogging issue. We have set up a water regulator in Tarkulani village which sucks up excess water and diverts it towards the river to prevent waterlogging. Now we are constructing Goddhaiya Nala with an investment of Rs 1,100 crore. Around 80% of its work is complete. This way we have resolved the waterlogging issue to a great extent and just a few places are left which will be made free from the problem. On employment front, we have made Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority where big companies are coming, and students will get a lot of job opportunities. Also, I have raised the issue in Parliament demaning opening of IIT and IIM in Gorakhpur. This would help students get quality education and technical skills too. For resolving traffic woes, we have got Rs 2,650 crore sanctioned from govt for the construction of the ring road. Its work is in progress.You are sitting in my house. I have shifted here with my wife and my children. If you just scroll down my social media wall of the last five years you will find my presence here, be it during the construction of the underpass, railway track or flyover, or inauguration of new facilities, you will find me wearing a mask and carrying a ration on a boat to help people during the pandemic. I am the only one who has raised 500 questions in Parliament in the interest of public and have become the No. 1 parliamentarian in Uttar Pradesh.Seats are won with ‘work’ and fulfilling ‘commitment’. My Prime Minister Modiji is a man of his words. ‘Unki kathani aur karni mai antar nahi hai’ the same is true with ‘Maharaj ji (CM Yogi). Be it Ram Mandir or Ayushman Yojana, all work committed by the party have been done. I am sure of a very big success in this region. We are winning maximum seats in UP including all in Purvanchal.“Maine itni ghatiya rajneeti ka starr nahi dekha, maine bahut saare election dekhey hain bachpan se par vipaksh ka starr bahut gir gaya hai iss election me. They don’t have facts or figures to counter PM Modi and hence are personally attacking PM and also Yogiji. ‘Rahul Gandhiji ki bhasha, Akhilesh Yadavji ki bhasha, inke pass jhoothe aropon ke alawa kuch nahi hai. The opposition doesn’t have anything to oppose, all they have is ‘26 logon ka immature dal’.These people are here just for elections. After elections you will see them flying off to foreign shores. Their flights are already booked for Italy and Australia. They don’t know India. It is a land of villages and they will get lost here if left alone. Modi govt has worked for all sections of society. Hence people from all communities, religions and castes have aligned to vote for him be it backward class, SC or Muslim women. Govt schemes like distribution of free ration, giving houses to poor and others have benefitted all. It was PM Modi who asked me to make a movie on organic farming and real India, hence my recently released film Lapata Ladies is getting so much love from people.Last time it was ‘Damru’ of our success and I am confident that this time it will be a deafening ‘Nagada’ of success.

"As poll campaign ends, SC readies to examine validity of freebies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-poll-campaign-ends-sc-readies-to-examine-validity-of-freebies/articleshow/110578073.cms,"NEW DELHI: As campaigning ends for the last phase of general elections marked by announcements of freebies and cash doles, the Supreme Court readies to hear a bunch of two-year-old PILs that demand political parties to compute the fiscal burden and fund mobilization for these freebies.From free education and meals for students in the 1950s, to free ration in the 1960s, free colour TVs, laptops and mixer-grinder by the turn of the century, it quickly escalated to free electricity, water and bus ride in the present day, political parties have scaled new heights with every general and assembly elections to pitch freebies as vote-catching tactics.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had heard detailed arguments on a bunch of PILs, led by one filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhya, consecutively on November 22-23 last year. But, thereafter, the cases remained part-heard. Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria on a couple of occasions requested the CJI, prior to voting, for completion of the hearing. However, the matter remained off the bench’s roster.SC registry sources said the matter is likely to be listed for hearing shortly after the court resumes normal work on July 8 after a month and half long summer vacation. The PILs were referred to a three-judge bench on Aug 26, 2022, by a bench headed by then CJI N V Ramana, as it realized that adjudicating the reliefs sought in these petitions would require reconsideration of a two-judge bench verdict in S Subramaniam Balaji judgment of 2013.In Balaji judgment, the SC while examining the petitioner’s plea that competitive announcement of freebies by DMK and AIADMK, amounted to bribing the voters to influence their voting and hence a corrupt practice under the Representation of People Act.The SC had disagreed and said, “It is well settled that the concept of livelihood is no longer confined to bare physical survival in terms of food, clothing and shelter but also now necessarily includes basic medicines, preliminary education, transport, etc. Hence, the State distrusting largesse in the form of distribution of colour TVs, laptops, etc. to eligible and deserving persons is directly related to the directive principles of the State policy.”In contrast, the SC while dealing with Upadhyay-led PILs on Aug 26, 2022, said, “Freebies may create a situation wherein the State Government cannot provide basic amenities due to lack of funds and the State is pushed towards imminent bankruptcy. In the same breath, we should remember that such freebies are extended utilizing taxpayers’ money only for increasing the popularity of the party and electoral prospects.”On the same breath, it had said, “all promises cannot be equated with freebies as they relate to welfare schemes or measures for the public good. Not only are these a part of the Directive Principles of state policy but are also a responsibility of the welfare state.”The EC, after initial reluctance to take a stand recently filed an affidavit in the SC proposing that parties can be asked to provide data on estimated number of beneficiaries, likely expenditure and total financial burden and the means to generate the amount required to fulfil the promises. But the political parties have suggested to the court not to venture into the arena of electoral politics and said the parties are responsible enough to understand the fiscal burden while announcing freebies.If the EC proposal finds workable in the eyes of the SC, then political parties would have to employ economists to answer queries about the impact of financing implementation of freebies on the fiscal sustainability of state/country, its effect on debt servicing, and whether the party, on coming to power, would resort to additional borrowings.",The Supreme Court readies to hear a bunch of two-year-old PILs that demand political parties to compute the fiscal burden and fund mobilization for these freebies.

"In Premchand’s birthplace Lamhi, change is on view, and in the air",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-premchands-birthplace-lamhi-change-is-on-view-and-in-the-air/articleshow/110578059.cms,"LAMHI: Poised roughly 10km from Varanasi, Lamhi could have been another faceless village of east Uttar Pradesh . But as the birthplace of Hindi-Urdu litterateur Munshi Premchand , it is both celebrated and privileged. Only, it is no longer a village, either by looks or designation.Over the years, especially in the last decade, north India’s premier temple town has swelled and swallowed nearby areas. Lamhi is now part of Varanasi’s Nagar Nigam (municipal corporation). “We wanted the ward to be named after Premchand. But it didn’t happen,” says former pradhan Santosh Singh.Little surprise, real estate prices have soared. “From roughly Rs 10-12 lakh about a decade ago, a biswa (1,360 sq ft) costs anywhere between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 80 lakh now, depending on the locality. You could rent a single room for as little as Rs 300 per month. Now it is Rs 2,500,” he says.Lamhi has a panchayat bhavan, a post office, a primary school and a primary health centre. Small entrepreneurs are active. Beauty parlours, dry-cleaners, hardware stores, cosmetics and jewellery shops have also sprung up. Fresh advertisements of cement, private hospitals and coaching classes garnish the village walls. Premchand’s realistic novels and stories captured the song and suffering of rural India like few before or after. One wonders how the writer would have reacted to the change.Nearly 90 years after his death, Premchand too is all over Lamhi. The gateway to the village bears his memory. A memorial with a marble bust, a dormant research and study centre affiliated to Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and a pond are named after the ex-village’s illustrious son.Lamhi is part of Chandauli Lok Sabha constituency. Patels (OBCs by caste) form roughly half the village’s population. The Patel percentage was higher but with other castes such as Brahmins building homes here in recent years, the larger caste demographic has altered. Kayasthas roughly form 10%. Premchand was a Kayastha; his real name being Dhanpat Rai Srivastav. Muslims, Dalits, Kumhars, Rajbhars and Thakurs make up the rest. The village has about 2,600 votes.Chandauli has been fickle in choosing political sides: Samajwadi Party (1999), Bahujan Samaj Party (2004), and SP again in (2009). But the last two terms (2014 and 2019) were claimed by BJP’s Mahendra Nath Pandey, the 62-year-old former Union minister who holds a doctorate in Hindi from BHU.By all accounts, Pandey was on an unsure wicket in the previous elections, till Pulwama happened. The Feb 2019 terror strike left 40 CRPF soldiers dead. One of them, Awadesh Kumar Yadav, was from Chandauli district. Some others were born in nearby east Uttar Pradesh areas of Deoria and Maharajganj. The dastardly attack changed the public mood. Several demonstrations were staged. Pandey prevailed by 14,000 votes; in 2014, he had romped home by 1.6 lakh votes.In the recent past, most Patels have preferred BJP, which is in alliance with Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal (S). Surendra Patel, who runs a hardware store, says a majority of Patels are still with BJP but, this time, quite a few will vote for others. “Not many like the BJP candidate. SP’s Birender Singh is more accessible and people-oriented,” he says. Birendra, a 65-year-old science graduate, is a former MLA.Ajay Gupta, who runs a small grocery store, says his family will vote for Modi. “Mehngai hai par vikas bhi hai (There’s price rise, but development too),” he reasons. Mohd Sabir, whose family has received free grains and benefited from a subsidy for toilet construction some time back, differs. The 23-year-old driver talks about mehngai (price rise) and how examination paper leaks are a major issue for students. “There are about 250 Muslim votes in the village. Most will vote for SP,” he says.Aiedhe village is contiguous to Lamhi. A group of Dalits sitting near Sant Shiromani Guru Ravidas Mandir are playing cards on a charpoy. They are annoyed with the Union govt. “Govt schools are no good and private ones are too expensive. How do we compete in this unequal world?” asks Rajesh Kumar. The Dalits are not happy with Mayawati either, especially the way she has handled the ‘political successor’ issue. “She should have discussed the subject with more seniors,” says Manish Kumar, an ITI student. The disappointments aside, most Dalits will vote for the 50-yearold BSP candidate Satendra Kumar Maurya. Like Akansha, a girl filling water from a hand pump.Suresh Chandra Dube, who looks after the Premchand memorial, says people want Modi to stay. “But unemployment and price rise worry them. Log mayoos hain (people are despondent),” he says.In a small room in the memorial, the writer’s books, photos and memorabilia are on display. The items include his personal hookah (smoking pipe). One black and white photo shows him with fellow Hindi litterateur Jaishankar Prasad; in another he is sitting in a chair with his wife. Premchand, who spent his last years in deprivation, is seen wearing torn shoes which later prompted a much-discussed essay by noted writer Harishankar Parsai.Godan and Nirmala are among Premchand’s finest novels. Shatranj Ke Khiladi, the subject of a 1978 Satyajit Ray film, Kafan and Idgah are among his greatest stories. “All copies of his book, Soz-e-Watan, were burnt by the British. Premchand was a patriot and a reformer,” says Dube. What saddens him is that the research institute is now defunct. “There are no books, teachers, research scholars or sanitation workers. Only the security guards come and go,” he says.","Lamhi is the birthplace of Hindi-Urdu litterateur Munshi Premchand.

Will Mirzapur roll out ‘kaleen’ thrice in a row for Anupriya?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-mirzapur-roll-out-kaleen-thrice-in-a-row-for-anupriya/articleshow/110577912.cms,"Water, a deciding factor

Caste matrix in poll play

The underdog

Urban voters

MIRZAPUR: Mirzapur , made famous by the OTT series, has never given an incumbent MP a third term. Anupriya Patel , 43, the sitting MP since 2014 and the candidate from Apna Dal (Sonelal), an NDA constituent, is aiming to break the jinx this time. Anupriya’s main contender is BJP turncoat and sitting MP from neighbouring Bhadohi seat, Ramesh Chand Bind, 50, who has entered the fray from SP after being denied the ticket in his constituency.Mirzapur comprises five assembly segments — Chhanbey, Mirzapur, Majhawan, Chunar and Marihaan. While gun-toting mafia dons like ‘ Kaleen Bhaiya ’ are limited to reel life, the real-life kaleen (carpet) traders are keen on an MP who can address their business concerns. Rajesh Kumar, vice-president of All India Carpet Manufacturers’ Association, says: “The one district, one product scheme has certainly created a brand value for Bhadohi-Mirzapur carpets, but the industry is not getting the support it needs. Incentives have been rolled back and additional compliances and regulations introduced in recent years have impacted the business.”SP candidate Bind has an uphill task to consolidate voters beyond Muslims, Yadavs and Binds. The three communities account for about five lakh votes. Although Bind has deep roots in politics — he was BSP MLA from Majhawan, dominated by Binds, Dalits and Brahmins, for three consecutive terms (2002, 2007 and 2012) — he has also been mired in controversies for making inappropriate remarks against upper castes.For Mirzapur, the driest region in Uttar Pradesh, the shortage of water — both potable and non-potable — is one of the main election issues. Farmers in Mirzapur — which sits by the Ganga — rely heavily on monsoon-fed dams and reservoirs for agriculture. Presence of red sandstone and rocky terrain make drilling of borewells difficult in this region.The sluice gates of the reservoir, which is the primary source of irrigation in more than three dozen villages of Marihaan sub-division of Mirzapur, were last raised during 2022 Rabi season. The starting point of the canal near the gates has now dried up and algae has covered its bed.Baba Yadav, a local resident and a worker of Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction, says: “For the past two years, we have been struggling in every cropping season as no water comes through the canal. In remote areas of Mirzapur, every family depends on agriculture for livelihood. Ahead of the paddy cultivation in Jan and Feb, power supply was also irregular because of which borewells could not be operated.” Yadav adds that he has been unable to convey these concerns to the party brass due to lack of access.Scheduled Caste voters, who account for 26% of the 19 lakh electors, can be the deciding factor for any party in Mirzapur. Half of them are Jatavs, old loyalists of BSP, which has fielded Manish Kumar Tripathi in the seat. Mirzapur also has a higher population of Kol voters compared to Pasis.OBCs, particularly Patels, constitute the largest chunk in the district and are expected to stand by Anupriya firmly for the third time. Rajesh Patel, a businessman in Rajgarh development block of Chunar, says, “I will support Anupriya because she is our community leader and a minister. Her margin may drop but she will sail through.” Patel, however, adds: “No steps were taken when we needed water and electricity for our crops in Jan and Feb. Water crisis is perennial and we hope Anupriya will find a permanent solution in her third term.”Backing SP’s Bind, Mithlesh Prajapati from Danti village of Majhawan says, “Bulldozers were used to bring down houses of 40 rural families in Danti in Jan last year. Nobody paid heed to our pleas, and it is time to teach a lesson to the local MLA and MP.” Local administration had identified the land in Danti for setting up a university and razed the houses to clear the land. However, the project was later shifted to Deori Kalan.Unlike Kaushambi, Fatehpur and some parts of Bundelkhand where Patels split up between Apna Dal (S) and its rival faction Apna Dal (Kamerawadi), the community stands united behind Anupriya in Mirzapur. However, Apna Dal (K) is also putting up a fight and has fielded 71-year-old Daulat Ram Patel — a retired maths professor, a former pradhan and a socialist associated with both SP and Congress — from Mirzapur.He has been instrumental in providing employment to youths in Chunar through his company which converts biomass into biofuels. Along with BSP’s Brahmin candidate Manish Tripathi, Daulat might shrink Anupriya’s vote bank.Urban voters in Mirzapur say work on the upcoming Vindhyavasini shrine corridor, proposed investment projects and improved connectivity through national highways might go in favour of the BJPApna Dal (S) alliance. Shyam Kumar Dubey, who runs a battery shop near Mirzapur railway station, says, “You should have seen the railway station earlier to realise what has changed. The only issue which I can recollect was frequent closure of the Lal Bahadur Shastri bridge (pucca pul) over the Ganga during the past three years for repair works.”","Mirzapur, the driest region in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the main election issues.

"In Diamond Harbour, Trinamool expects its ‘ratna’ to shine again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-diamond-harbour-trinamool-expects-its-ratna-to-shine-again/articleshow/110577859.cms,"The rise of Diamond Harbour in West Bengal ’s political map in the last decade has been intertwined with the phenomenal growth of its MP Abhishek Banerjee in Bengal politics.From a novice in 2014 to Trinamool Congress ’s general secretary and No.2 in 2024, the political strides of Banerjee have also seen Diamond Harbour, a former Left bastion, elect him with a 3.2 lakh margin in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The 2021 assembly polls gave Banerjee further cushion, with Trinamool winning all seven segments in the Lok Sabha constituency.“I’m contesting an election. I’m not an astrologer. I can’t predict the future, but I have left no stone unturned in serving people.... I’m hopeful and optimistic that the margin that Diamond Harbour gave me last time will increase further and people will continue to shower their love and blessings on us as we have worked hard in the last 10 years,” Banerjee said.Courtesy Banerjee, there is the ‘Diamond Harbour model’ — a mix of welfare schemes for the elderly and others, health facilities and educational initiatives. It had become the talking point in the state during Covid. In the last 10 years, projects worth Rs 5,580 crore were implemented in Diamond Harbour constituency, Banerjee claimed, saying it would be replicated statewide.Since his 2019 Lok Sabha poll win, Banerjee has emerged as the ‘general’ in Trinamool ranks. During the highly successful 2021 assembly poll campaign, he devised the party strategy and anchored the campaign with his aunt and Bengal CMMamata Banerjee . He also played a key role in the party’s success in the municipal and panchayat polls, in 2022 and 2023, respectively.While campaigning for Banerjee in Metiabruz on Wednesday, Mamata recollected: “I had promised Abhishek that I would visit his constituency once. Abhishek has been in politics since he was two years old when CPM attacked me. He saw me and would chant slogans seeking answers from CPM for attacking me. These CPM goons have become the leaders of the BJP.”A day before, women and men had gathered on both sides of Sarisha Cross- ing braving the scorching sun to get a glimpse of Banerjee during a roadshow. Nearly one-and-a-half hours later, he arrived sitting atop his MUV and was greeted with ululation and the blowing of conch shells. Banerjee, the politician, is also a youth icon here. “The younger ones have his hairstyle and wear white kurtapyjamas and spectacles like him,” said Ratanpur farmer Rehan Ali, who travelled 5km to watch Banerjee.On the other hand, the opposition campaign, beset with rumblings, has been a late starter in Diamond Harbour. Despite multiple claims by key partner Indian Secular Front’s Nawsad Siddiqui, the only MLA of the Left-Congress alliance in the 2021 assembly elections, that he would contest against Banerjee, the party finally nominated Majnu Laskar as its candidate. CPM had already nominated Pratikur Rahaman as its candidate. BJP took more than a month to name Abhijit Das.Diamond Harbour has around 55% Hindus and 35% Muslims voters. SCs comprise 20.6%, and STs 0.1% of the electorate. As much as 51% of its voters are staying in urban zones.Like any other Lok Sabha seat, Diamond Harbour too has issues plaguing it. Opposition alleges “a climate of threat and intimidation”.Residents complain of water scarcity issues, waterlogging and most importantly, of shut industries on the urban stretches at Satgachia, Maheshtala or Budge Budge.Perhaps it is nowhere more evident than at Budge Budge, an old settlement dotted with jute mills, oil companies, and small industrial units. A lot of high-rises have come up on old industrial premises on the Budge Budge Road from Dakghar to Budge Budge via Maheshtala.“TMC is propagating a model of coercion and undemocratic practices. The way voters are being intimidated is unacceptable in a democracy. It is not a model for development, but a laboratory of violence,” said BJP’s Das. The party had a sizable 34% vote share in the last elections.CPM state committee member Pratikur, 33, dismisses claims of being intimidated by Banerjee’s stature.“I am not fighting against any individual. My fight is against the policies of TMC and BJP,” he claimed. “They are trying to polarise elections on religious grounds. Our fight is not for caste or religion but for class. They cannot stop me with violence. I will fight back hard,” Rahaman said.","Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee has been in politics since he was two years old.

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area, claiming it to be the highest ever recorded in India. This extreme heatwave has sparked widespread concern and debates on its accuracy and implications, prompting a closer examination of the data and its effects on daily life in the city.While the IMD's automated weather station recorded the temperature, meteorologist Soma Sen Roy indicated that the accuracy of this reading is under review. This extreme temperature surpassed the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. As the national capital grapples with this intense heat, officials have issued red alerts, emphasizing the severe health risks and urging precautions.""The maximum temperature over Delhi NCR varied from 45.2° to 49.1°C in different parts of city, Mungeshpur reported 52.9°C as an outlier compared to other stations. It could be due to error in the sensor or the local factor. IMD is examining the data and sensors,"" the IMD said in a statement.In a post on X, Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju flagged the error, saying that the temperature of 52.3 degree Celsius in Delhi is ""very unlikely.""""It is not official yet. Temperature of 52.3°C in Delhi is very unlikely. Our senior officials in IMD have been asked to verify the news report. The official position will be stated soon,"" Kiren Rijiju said in the post.Yes, according to the IMD, Delhi's Mungeshpur area recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius on May 29, 2024.However, IMD meteorologist Soma Sen Roy mentioned that they are ""checking out"" the accuracy of the recording.The recorded 52.9 degrees Celsius surpasses the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. It also broke the 50C threshold for the first time in Delhi's history.The IMD has issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of ""severe heat-wave conditions"" and highlighting the ""very high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke in all ages"". They are also reviewing the accuracy of the recorded temperature.Residents are adopting various measures such as staying indoors, using traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice), taking multiple baths, and keeping hydrated. Amit Kumar from Najafgarh mentioned, ""We're taking traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice) and using wet towels to stay cool and prevent fainting.""High temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke and dehydration. Dr. Atul Mathur warned, ""If you have not been drinking water, you will be dehydrated. For those who have pre-existing heart issues, their BP becomes high.""The intense heat has strained daily activities and essential services. The electricity grid faced a record peak demand of 8,302 megawatts. Water shortages are a significant issue, with authorities ordering measures to prevent wastage. People are also facing severe challenges in commuting and outdoor work, as highlighted by residents like Jay Pandit, who said, ""The hot wind feels like burning the skin, and it's affecting my health.""Years of scientific research suggest that climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent, and more intense. This trend poses a growing threat to public health, infrastructure, and daily life in urban areas like Delhi.The Delhi government has issued red alerts and health advisories, urging people to stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours. They have also deployed teams to prevent water wastage and manage the city's strained resources.The IMD has warned of continuing severe heatwave conditions across several northern states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The trend indicates that extreme weather events will likely become more frequent due to climate change.","The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area.

PM Modi begins 2-day meditation at Kanniyakumari's Vivekananda Rock Memorial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-arrives-kanniyakumari-to-meditate-at-vivekananda-rock-till-june-1/articleshow/110567788.cms,"Key facts about

NEW DELHI: Following the conclusion of election campaign for Lok Sabha Elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and began his 2-day meditation till June 1. PM Modi is meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam, the same spot where Swami Vivekananda once meditated.The Prime Minister arrived at the Bhagavathi Amman temple from nearby Thiruvananthapuram by helicopter. He worshipped at the temple and then made his way to the rock memorial via a ferry service.Dressed in a dhoti and a white shawl, Modi offered prayers at the temple and walked all the way round the 'garbhagriha'. The priests performed a special 'arthi' and presented him with temple 'prasad', which included a shawl and a framed photograph of the temple's presiding deity.After the 'arthi' PM Modi reached the rock memorial using a ferry service provided by the state government-run shipping corporation. He commenced his meditation at the 'dhyan mandapam.' Prior to beginning his meditation, the prime minister briefly stood on the stairs leading to the mandapam, taking in the stunning views of the surrounding sea.Modi paid his respects to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, mother Sri Sarada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda by showering flowers on their portraits. A life-size statue of Swami Vivekananda on a high pedestal adorns the mandapam. Following this, Modi began his sadhana (spiritual practice) within the mandapam.At the end of the 2014 and 2019, PM Modi had made similar trips - first to Pratapgarh, the stronghold of Shivaji, and later to a cave in the vicinity of the Kedarnath temple.This visit will mark the Prime Minister's ninth trip to Tamil Nadu since January.Kanniyakumari holds a special place in the life of Swami Vivekananda, as it was here that he had a profound vision of Bharat Mata after wandering across the country. The rock upon which he meditated for three days is believed to have had a significant impact on his life, similar to how Sarnath is important in the life of Gautam Buddha.The location also has religious significance, as it is believed that Goddess Parvati meditated on one foot at the same spot while waiting for Lord Shiva.Kanniyakumari is not only the meeting point of India's eastern and western coastlines but also the confluence of the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and Arabian Sea.It is well-known that PM Modi undertakes spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns, having previously visited Kedarnath in 2019 and Shivaji's Pratapgarh in 2014.Swami Vivekananda took India’s spiritual fame to the world at the Parliament of World’s Religions held in Chicago in 1893. It was in honour of the great monk that the memorial was erected in 1970. The rock on which the memorial is built is said to be where Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Legends also say that it was on this rock that goddess Kanniyakumari prayed to lord Shiva, thus attaining an important place in India’s religious premises. There is a specially preserved portion in the rock which is believed to be the imprint of the goddess’s feet. The memorial showcases an elegant blend of different architectural genres. The Sripada Mandapam and Vivekananda Mandapam are two structures to be explored in the memorial. There is also a life-sized bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda in the premises.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Bhagavathi Amman temple from nearby Thiruvananthapuram by helicopter.

From 'Mangalsutra' to 'Mujra' attack

PM Modi surpasses his 2019 record

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's whirlwind Lok Sabha election campaign , which included a total of 206 public outreach programmes - some laced with a lot of acrimony and aggression, ended on Thursday with a rally in Punjab's Hoshiyarpur. The Prime Minister also gave a total of 80 media interviews, averaging more than one daily since the polls began.The 76-day campaign period saw a rare censure for the BJP by the Election Commission over opposition allegations of divisive speech against the Prime Minister. In fact, both BJP chief JP Nadda and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge were warned and told by the poll body to rein in their star campaigners which included PM Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi among others.The EC had then said in a statement: ""The Commission expects top leaders of political parties, especially of the major national parties, most of whom are star campaigners, to set good examples of campaign discourse expected of them in the current elections.""""It is primarily the leaders' responsibility to correct the course of their statements ""to avoid any permanent dent on the delicately balanced social fabric of the country,"" the poll body had told the party chiefs of BJP and Congress.As the campaign ended for the final phase of polls which is to be held on June 1, Kharge attacked Prime Minister Modi and claimed that he spoke about 'mandir-masjid' and divisive issues 421 times during poll campaigning despite the Election Commission's direction of no appeal for votes on caste and religion.Kharge also claimed that PM Modi in his speeches of the last 15 days took the Congress's name 232 times, his own name 758 times, but didn't talk about unemployment even once.PM Modi's predecessor Manmohan Singh on Thursday accused him of lowering the dignity of public discourse and the gravity of the office of the prime minister by giving ""hateful speeches"" during the poll campaign.However, undeterred by these attacks, the Prime Minister in his last rally for these elections asked the opposition to make no mistake in understanding him as he can disclose ""sins of their seven generations.""""I want to tell INDI Alliance leaders. I am silent but you should not make a mistake in understanding Modi... 'Modi jis din muh kholega to tumhari saat pidhi ke paap nikaal ke rakh dunga' (The day Modi opens his mouth, he will bring out the sins of your seven generations),"" he said.Prime Minister election speeches saw fierce attacks on the opposition, especially the Congress. From accusing the grand old party of planning to steal the Mangalsutras of women to charging the opposition of doing Mujra, one of the key themes of PM's attack was the policy of alleged appeasement by opposition parties.In his speeches, PM Modi also raised pitch against opposition's alleged plans to end reservations for OBCs and give those benefits to minorities (read Muslims).PM Modi started his Lok Sabha campaign with a strong pitch of Abki Baar 400 paar asserting that the NDA would win 400 seats and the BJP will cross the 370 mark. However, as the campaign progressed the discourse and narrative changed.Prime Minister Modi's 2024 election campaign of over 200 rallies and roadshows surpassed his nearly-145 public engagements during the 2019 polls during which the campaign period was 68 days. When the Election Commission announced the polls on March 16, PM Modi was already on a political tour of southern India - covering all five states in the three days between March 15 and March 17. We will have to wait till June 4, when the poll results will be out, to know how effective was PM Modi's high-pitched record campaign.(With inputs from agencies)",Prime Minister Narendra Modi's whirlwind Lok Sabha election campaign ended on Thursday.

""MEA has initiated action under provisions in the Passport Act 1967 for revocation of the diplomatic passport of Prajwal Revanna.

A day ago, Prajwal Revanna filed an anticipatory bail application in the sexual assault case at the Bengaluru sessions court.

Congress leader and Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge slammed the suspended JD-S leader Prajwal Revanna and said, ""I'm quite surprised that he remained silent when videos went viral, when a complaint was filed by the victims, and when the pen drives were being distributed. Suddenly, his consciousness wakes up and he says I was depressed and isolated. If you see the video closely, it doesn't look like a person in depression is speaking. He did not say a word about the victims. He could have said the same thing on Days 1, and 2. Why did it take him 30 days? If you look from a bird's eye view, you'll know that the BJP is directing everything.""

Verdict 2024: Has BJP Already Cruised To A Majority? Exit Poll Predictions I Lok Sabha Election

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday appealed to Punjab voters , two days ahead of their vote, to 'protect democracy and Constitution from repeated assaults' by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Calling the people of Punjab warriors, the Congress leader said that BJP has been targetting 'Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat' over the withdrawal of the three farm laws.Congress shared Singh's appeal to Punjab voters on X. ""My dear fellow citizens, India is standing at a crucial juncture. In the impending last phase of voting, we have one final chance to ensure that Democracy and our Constitution are protected from the repeated assaults of a despotic regime, trying to unleash dictatorship in India. Punjab and Punjabis are warriors. We are known for our spirit of sacrifice. Our indomitable courage and innate belief in the Democratic ethos of inclusiveness, harmony, amity, and brotherhood can protect our great nation,"" wrote Singh.""In the past ten years, the BJP government has left no stone unturned in castigating Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat. 750 farmers, mostly belonging to Punjab, were martyred while incessantly waiting at Delhi borders, for months together. As if the lathis and the rubber bullets were not enough, none less than the Prime Minister verbally assaulted our farmers by calling them ""Andolanjeevis"" and ""Parjeevi"" (Parasites) on the floor of the Parliament. Their only demand was the withdrawal of the three farm laws imposed on them without consulting them.Singh said that PM Modi had promised to double the income of farmers by 2022 but his policies in the last ten years have eroded the earnings of farmers. ""The national average monthly income of farmers is a meagre Rs. 27 rupees per day, while average debt per farmer is Rs. 27,000. High cost of input, including fuel and fertilizers, coupled with GST on at least 35 farm related equipment and a whimsical decision making in farm export and import, has destroyed the savings of our farm households and left them on the margins of our society. The Congress-UPA government had provided a loan waiver worth Rs 72,000 Cr to 3.73 Cr farmers, increased the MSP, widened its spectrum, increased production, while encouraging exports. All this resulted in double the growth in Agriculture in our period, as compared to the last ten years.""Explaining Congress party's 5 guarantees under 'Kisaan Nyay', the former PM said, ""These include-a legal guarantee of the MSP, a stable export-import policy for agriculture, a Permanent Commission on Agricultural Finance for loan waivers, direct transfer of insured compensation to the farmers in 30 days in case of crop losses and removal of GST on farm input products and equipment. In my opinion, these steps would create an environment for the second generation of agricultural reforms.""Speaking on GDP growth in India, Singh said, ""In the past 10 years, the nation's economy has witnessed unimaginable turmoil. The imposition of the demonetisation disaster, a flawed GST, and the painful mismanagement during the COVID pandemic has resulted in a miserable situation, where an expectation of a subpar 6-7 per cent GDP growth has become the new normal. Growth under BJP Government has plunged to under 6 per cent, while during Congress-UPA tenure, it was about 8 per cent (New Series). Unprecedented unemployment and unbridled inflation have greatly widened inequality, which is now at a 100-year high.""Comparing this with the Congress-UPA govt, Singh said that they managed to increase the purchasing power of people despite challenges. ""The misrule of the BJP Government has resulted in depletion of household savings to a historic 47-year low. Rural wages have witnessed a systematic fall, and wage disparity has led to widespread distress.""Criticising the Agniveer scheme of the armed forces, Singh said, ""Our youth is the most neglected section of society under the present dispensation. There are 30 lakh Government vacancies. Innumerable paper leaks have cast a dark shadow on their future, even as they are forced to wait for recruitment for years. The ""Yuva Nyay"" guarantees of Congress party is a course correction in this regard. The Right to Apprenticeship proposed by us will cross the barrier between learning, training, and employment. We have committed that 30 lakh vacancies would be systematically filled according to a job calendar, half of those jobs would be reserved for women, and we will. establish fast-track courts for paper leak cases.""""The BJP government imposed an ill-conceived Agniveer Scheme on our Armed Forces. The BJP thinks that the value of patriotism, bravery and service is only 4 years. This shows their fake nationalism. Those who trained for regular recruitment were woefully betrayed by the outgoing regime. The youth of Punjab, the son of the farmer, who dreams of serving the motherland through the Armed Forces, is now thinking twice about getting recruited only for a 4-year stint. Agniveer Scheme endangers National Security. Congress party has therefore promised to abolish the Agniveer Scheme,"" Singh added.""My dear fellow citizens, the Congress-UPA government made all possible efforts to help the people of Punjab. The Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor, which is now part of Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, and passes through Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Ludhiana was implemented during our tenure. A new oil refinery in Bhatinda was established in 2011, wherein GAIL's 2200 km cross-country pipeline was dedicated to the nation. We established an IIT at Ropar in 2008 and a National Law University in Patiala in 2006. In 2009, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh memorial was inaugurated at his native place at Khatkar Kalan. The UPA government released to the Government of Punjab for development of Talwandi Sabo and Anandpur Saheb as part of the tercentenary of Guruta-Gaddi of the Guru Granth Saheb.""""Even though there was an Akali-BJP government in the state for most part of my tenure, following true spirit of cooperative federalism, we left no stone unturned in providing the rightful share of resources to the people of Punjab. On the other hand, for five years, when the Congress party was in power, the BJP government at the Centre was consistent in denying funds to Punjab. Whether they were meant for debt restructuring, a legacy issue of the previous BJP-Akali government, or for farm loan waiver, or the pending wage liabilities for MGNREGA.""Heavily criticising PM Modi over his 'hateful, unparliamentary' speeches, Singh said that his speeches are 'purely divisive in nature.' Singh, who claimed to have been keenly following the political discourse during campaigning, said, ""Modi ji is the first Prime Minister to lower the dignity of public discourse, and thereby the gravity of the office of the Prime Minister. No Prime Minister in the past has uttered such hateful, unparliamentary and coarse terms, meant to target either a specific section of the society or the opposition. He has also attributed some false statements to me. I have never in my life singled out one community from the other. That is the sole copyright of the BJP.""""People of India are seeing through all of this. This narrative of dehumanization has now reachedits peak. It is now our duty to save our beloved nation from these forces of discord. With folded hands, I appeal to each one of you to give love, peace, fraternity, and harmony a chance in India. I appeal to each voter in Punjab to vote for development and inclusive progress. I appeal to all the young minds to exercise caution and vote for a brighter future Only Congress can ensure a growth-oriented progressive future, where Democracy and the Constitution shall be safeguarded.""Singh ended his appeal with a quote from Allama Iqbal,","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed to Punjab voters to 'protect democracy and Constitution from repeated assaults' by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Calling the people of Punjab warriors, the Congress leader said that BJP has been targetting 'Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat' over the withdrawal of three farm laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110564219,imgsize-1124894,width-400,resizemode-4/110564219.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a recent election rally in Dalpur, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath praised BJP’s Mandi candidate Kangana Ranaut saying that she ""embodies Meera Bai's devotion and Maharani Lakshmi Bai's bravery"".The UP CM also highlighted Ranaut's talent, artistry, and capability for hard work, noting her passion and ability to drive development. He mentioned her journey from the mountains to carving a niche for herself in the film industry through her strengths and struggles.Adityanath urged people to ensure Kangana Ranaut's victory and highlighted that all four seats of Himachal Pradesh, including Mandi, should contribute to BJP’s aim of '400 paar'.""Today, a single slogan resonates across India: 'Fir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar' and 'Abki Baar 400 Paar'. The nation is rallying for 'Jo Ram Ko Laye Hain, Hum Unko Layenge'. This election is a contest between Ram Bhakts and Ram Drohis. Ram Drohis are those who support terrorism and naxalism, question India's identity, obstruct development and rob the poor of their rights,"" he added.The UP chief minister described the current election as a contest between Ram Bhakts and Ram Drohis, with the latter being those who support terrorism and naxalism, question India's identity, obstruct development and rob the poor of their rights.He mentioned the completion of the grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Kashi and announced plans for Mathura, assuring that the BJP would take the necessary steps to uphold India's identity. He also highlighted India's increased global respect under Prime Minister Modi's leadership and contrasted India's development projects with Pakistan's struggles with hunger.Criticising the opposition coalition, Adityanath called the INDI alliance 'Bhanumati Ka Pitara' and alleged that the Congress manifesto mirrors Muslim League with aims to impose Taliban-like rule in the country through the implementation of inheritance tax and personal law.He likened the proposed inheritance tax to Aurangzeb's Jizya tax and said that India would be governed by Baba Saheb's constitution, not Sharia law.Kangana Ranaut is pitted against Congress' Vikramaditya Singh in Mandi, a constituency that holds symbolic significance for the Congress as a bastion of the Virbhadra family.

"Punjab sinking, youth eye flight with visa power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-sinking-youth-eye-flight-with-visa-power/articleshow/110577806.cms,"AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR/LUDHIANA: At Gurdwara Shaheedan Baba Nihal Singhji in Talhan village , about 13km from Jalandhar in Punjab, the dreams of those who want to go abroad and start a new life are pinned on a plastic wing and a prayer at ‘hawaijahaj wale gurdware’ (airplane gurdwara).In a state where the measure of one’s success depends on how many of your relatives are ‘NRIs’ (non-resident Indians), the gurdwara gets thousands of toy planes every day which are later distributed to children who visit the shrine.While the gurdwara has never claimed any such divine powers to issue visas, believers like Ravinder Kaur from Raya city in Amritsar district keep hoping for a miracle. Her nephew’s visa has been rejected thrice by Canadian authorities. He filed his fourth application for a tourist visa in the morning and Ravinder brought him to the gurdwara, an hour away from their home, for blessings. “He is a plumber. He has all the required documents and has even shown property in his name. But he has been unlucky so far. I thought coming to the gurdwara will help,” said Ravinder.She has reasons to be hopeful. Her son had applied for a visa to Australia and Canada in 2019 and visited the gurdwara. “He got acceptance letters from both. He settled for Canada and works as a cab driver there,” said Kaur. Now all her children, two sons and a daughter, are in Canada or Australia. She says the travel agency in her city sells 150-200 air tickets every month to these two countries.Talhan lies in the Doaba region known as Punjab’s NRI belt . Every street corner advertises English language exams like IELTS necessary for admission in foreign universities. Agencies pitch their “visa first, pay later” or “full family visa guaranteed” schemes through billboards, insta reels and YouTube videos. There are tall promises of converting tourist visas into a work permit, “full packages” that include admission in a college to getting a job that costs several lakhs.But the harsh truth is that not everyone is flying high. For every successful application, there are thousands that are rejected. So, how about those who are left behind?Punjab, once the poster boy of the country’s success in self-reliance, has crashed and burnt, and how. According to a study, the state’s agriculture grew by 5% from 1971 to 1986 even as Indian agriculture grew at 2.3%. Between 2006 and 2014-15, its output grew by only 1.6% while India averaged 3.5%. It has stagnated since then. The state’s GDP too has nosedived. It topped all states in 1981 and was ranked fourth in 2001. It is currently ranked 16 with a GDP of about Rs 8 lakh crore.With agricultural growth stagnating, few youngsters want to become farmers. Salvinder Singh, a farmer from Ajnala’s Jagdeep Khurd village, an hour away from Amritsar, admits there are no young men left in his village. “There is no work.Agniveer scheme has blocked their chances for an army job. Farming cannot sustain our families anymore. Whoever could afford it have sent their children abroad. In frustration, children are tempted to take chitta (drugs),” he said.Most young people feel ignored by po litical leaders and frustrated by the lack of employment opportunities in the country. Industry too has given Punjab the miss. Once famous for production of sports goods, Ludhiana’s industry has slowly withered away. Federation Of Punjab Small Industries Associations president Bandish Jindal says states like UP, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have beaten Punjab by providing cheap land, labour, and power. “The input costs in Punjab are so high that they make our products unviable,” he says. If competition from Chinese products was not enough, closure of trade with Pakistan has also hit businesses badly. Farm protests have created supply problems.In an example of how states have leaped forward in progress where Punjab has barely crawled, Jindal says GST collection in Haryana and Punjab in 2016 was Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 16,200 crore, respectively. “Now Haryana has a collection of Rs 80,000 crore whereas we are at Rs 20,000 crore,” he says.This is also reflected in govt data for 2022-23 that recorded an unemployment rate of 6.7% in the state as compared to the national average of 3.4%.Lack of employment opportunities is a major talking point in every poll rally, but whether it is BJP, Congress or AAP, there is a public perception that these are empty promises and little has changed on the ground.Twenty-four-year-old Ishika (uses one name) who is pursuing post graduation in Punjabi language in Amritsar, is already worried. “I still have a year to complete my studies but the thought of getting a job is so stressful. There appears to be no options for young people who have stayed back,” she says. Ishika’s brother and her cousin have moved to Russia and Canada, respectively, and are unlikely to come back.In Jalandhar’s Model Town, 22-year-old Neha (uses one name), who started as a sales staffer soon after finishing school, was lucky enough to find a job but without much of a future. As she folds clothes and hangs them back in their racks, she knows she will never be able to afford the international brand she works 12 hours for. She can see the gleaming SUVs zipping past her on the road outside. “My husband is also in a sales job and we both work long hours but there is hardly enough to meet expenses and there is no scope for growth,” she says.Neha tried her luck and filled forms for the police and railway recruitment exams but was not successful. Every year, lakhs appear for a few thousand govt posts which are quickly filled up.Punjab Travel Agents Association former president Kuldip Singh Hayer, who runs Universal Travels in Jalandhar city, says, “Degrees in India, whether public or private colleges, are easily available but they have no value. Unemployment is so high that despite challenges like large amounts of money required, people are desperate to go overseas.” The recent capping of visas by Canada for instance is likely to hit students who desire to go abroad. Attacks on students and stories of hostility towards Indians haven’t helped.Ishika says, “Politicians don’t talk about jobs and even when they make promises, they rarely ever come through. Can you blame anyone if the line at the IELTS coaching centre is longer than the one at school?” she asks.","Punjab, once the poster boy of the country’s success in self-reliance, has crashed and burnt.

Balasore pins hopes on polls to rocket it towards better days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/balasore-pins-hopes-on-polls-to-rocket-it-towards-better-days/articleshow/110577732.cms,"Apart from the defence ministry’s missile testing facility, Balasore , a constituency in Odisha bordering West Bengal, is known for its industries. However, with many factories and MSME units in the area tottering, the development of the industrial sector becomes a hot topic during every elections only to be forgotten after voting. BJP turncoat in BJD mantle is up against two former Union ministers, from Congress and the saffron party.BJP candidate Pratap Chandra Sarangi ’s simplicity, BJD nominee Lekhasri Samantsinghar ’s people connect, and Congress veteran Shrikanta Jena’s experience are drawing crowds to their campaign events.Interestingly, both Jena and Sarangi have represented this constituency and served in the UPA and the Modi ministries, respectively. Adding to the plot, three-time BJP MP Kharabela Swain is seeking mandate as an Independent.Balasore constituency comprises seven assembly segments: Balasore, Remuna, Jaleswar, Bhograi, Basta, and Nilgiri in Balasore district, and Badasahi in Mayurbhanj district. Congress has won the seat nine times and BJP on four occasions, including in 2019. BJD had the last laugh in 2014.Sitting MP Sarangi believes people want change and will bring BJP to power both in Odisha and at Centre. He highlights the need to address corruption, hooliganism, and the lack of development in sectors such as agriculture, education, health, and drinking water. Sarangi also emphasises the importance of reviving closed industries and MSMEs in the region.“Balasore is famous for ‘dhana (paddy), pana (betel leaf), and mina (fish)’. BJD govt could not add value to any of these sectors. People are compelled to leave the state to eke out a living. Democracy in the state is in danger. Irrigation facilities are in doldrums despite having rivers. Farmers need support,” Sarangi said.Former state BJP vice-president Lekhasri, who joined BJD recently, criticised the two former Union ministers for not delivering goods. She has prepared a manifesto for the economic transformation of Balasore, focusing on developing the region as an MSME hub, logistics centre, and an IT services hub. Lekhasri also stressed the need to treat agriculture as an industry to increase farmers’ income.“What BJD promises, it delivers in time. This time, we are getting a very good response from the people of Balasore. Development of this constituency is my priority. I am com mitted to work towards achieving all the sustainable development goals for my area. I am reaching out to all voters of Balasore with this approach,” the BJD nominee said.Jena, who has worked with former chief minister Biju Patnaik, said no new industry has been set up in Balasore while the existing ones were struggling. He highlighted the potential of the CIPET-Centre for Skilling and Technical Support (CSTS) and the software technology park in Balasore, which were set up during the UPA govt. Jena also criticised the state govt’s industrial policy which she said has failed to support small-scale industries and emphasised the need to utilise the region’s land, water, long coast, and tourism potential for growth.“There is no remarkable improvement in the irrigation facility in Balasore. An old canal, the coast canal of the British era, if revived, will help industries, transport of minerals, pisciculture, and agriculture in several districts including Balasore. A big asset has been left idle,” he said.Residents are seeking better irrigation facilities, employment opportunities, quality education, and healthcare services. Ramanath Panda, a 41-year-old farmer, expressed concerns about the lack of irrigation facilities in the constituency.“There is huge untapped potential for irrigation. If the irrigation issue is solved, farmers’ income will increase. People go outside the state in search of employment because we do not have any jobs here.Industries are winding up their operations. Politicians promise many things, but they do not fulfil them once they are elected,” he said. Social activist Pankaj Jena, 48, said the standard of govt school education has been falling. Large hospital buildings were constructed but there are no doctors there,” he said.The largest city in northern Odisha and a significant urban hub, Balasore also houses the Integrated Test Range (ITR) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). ITR boasts missile testing facilities at two locations: Chandipur in Balasore district and Abdul Kalam Island (Wheeler Island) in the adjacent Bhadrak district.The expansive Chandipur range is equipped with advanced technical facilities and features three distinct missile launch complexes, enabling DRDO to conduct comprehensive testing and evaluation of various missile systems.From a Congress-CPI bastion in its early days, Balasore has voted for Janata Dal, BJP and BJD in the past. Congress won the seat six times, the last being in 2009. BJP won the seat four times while CPI won twice and BJD only once in 2014.","Balasore, a constituency in Odisha bordering West Bengal, is known for its industries. With many factories and MSME units in the area tottering, the development of the industrial sector becomes a hot topic during every elections. Congress has won the seat nine times and BJP on four occasions, including in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110577752,imgsize-1607920,width-400,resizemode-4/110577752.jpg"

Thanks to its special focus on enrolling vulnerable sections like persons with disabilities, third gender, senior citizens and particularly vulnerable tribal groups, there was a 23% rise in total registered TG voters as compared to 2019 polls. A total 48,044 TG electors were in the roll as on March 16, 2024, up from 39,075 in 2019 and 28,527 in 2014.Many third gender voters prefer to register as male or female voters, often due to fear of coming out, since electoral roll is a public document, and lack of social acceptance. However, with the EC having sensitised its machinery on the ground and growing societal acceptance, TG voters are coming forward to not only register as a separate category but also to cast their vote.A look at the states/UTs that went to polls in a single phase — for which the gender-wise turnouts are available — shows the highest TG turnout in Goa at 75%, followed by Puducherry at 69.5%, Sikkim at 66.7%, Andaman and Nicobar at 50%, Andhra at 44.3%, Kerala at 40.9%, Tamil Nadu at 32%, Gujarat at 30.8%, Telangana at 30.2%, Uttarakhand at 29.5%, Delhi at 28% and Haryana at 18.2%.","EC’s efforts to make the 2024 general election more inclusive had started right from the voter registration stage.

A damdar govt is one that decimates the enemy. A damdar govt is one that goes right into the enemy’s home to strike. A damdar govt is one that makes Bharat atmanirbhar (self-dependent) in every way possible,” Modi said.The PM said BJP had drawn up a roadmap for the first 125 days of its prospective third term, reserving 25 of those for the welfare of the country’s youth.Accusing AAP of “destroying both agriculture and industry” in Punjab and Congress of fathering corruption in the country, Modi said he could take all the insults hurled at him by them, but not anyone making a mockery of the country and its people.He said there could be “no greater sin” than constituents of the INDIA bloc using the armed forces as a political weapon, alluding to Congress and its allies repeatedly talking about scrapping the Agnipath recruitment scheme if the alliance came to office.“You abuse Modi as much you want, but Modi will not tolerate this insult to my country’s armed forces. I am silent but you should not make any mistake in understanding Modi...Modi jis din muh kholega, tumhari saat pidhi ke paap nikaal ke rakh dega (The day Modi opens his mouth, he will bring out the sins of your seven generations),” the PM said.On AAP, which came to office in Punjab by ousting ally Congress, Modi said, “It took Congress 60 years to do a PhD in corruption but they (AAP) are born corrupt.” He added, “In Punjab, they are doing a drama of contesting separately, but in Delhi, they are together.”The PM, who campaigned for BJP candidates Anita Som Parkash and Subhash Sharma, said the drug mafia was operating with impunity in Punjab and gang wars were escalating alongside atrocities on women.“AAP is watching all this happen. Their chief (Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal ) makes fake slogans and fake policies, and has malicious intent,” he said.On Congress alleging that BJP would “change the Constitution” if it got a third term, Modi said the irony was that “these are the same people who strangulated the Constitution during Emergency”.“Where was the Constitution when burning tyres were put around Sikhs during the 1984 riots?” Modi said Kartarpur Sahib “would have been in India had Congress not left it to Pakistan”.He said the next BJP govt would name Adampur airport after Guru Ravidas . “When you come to see Guru Ravidas’s place (in Varanasi), you are my guest as I am the MP of that constituency.”","PM Modi wrapped up his marathon campaign in Punjab ’s Hoshiarpur Thursday.

Desi co launches world’s 1st rocket with one-piece 3D-printed engine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-co-launches-worlds-1st-rocket-with-one-piece-3d-printed-engine/articleshow/110575268.cms,"BENGALURU: In a big boost for India’s private space industry, Agnikul Cosmos , an IIT-Madras-incubated startup, successfully launched on Thursday the world’s first rocket with a single-piece 3D-printed engine.The single-stage rocket, called ‘Agnibaan - Sub-Orbital Technology Demonstrator ( SOrTeD )’, lifted off from India’s first private launchpad, Dhanush, at Sriharikota at 7.15am, marking the country’s first semi-cryogenic engine-powered rocket launch. It was powered by Agnikul’s Agnilet engine.In the past two months, the startup had to call off the mission minutes before the scheduled lift-off twice — on April 7 and May 28. Thursday’s historic mission, Agnikul’s inaugural flight, demonstrated indigenous technologies, gathered crucial flight data and ensured optimal functioning of systems for their orbital launch vehicle, ‘Agnibaan’, in the future.Agnikul co-founder and CEO Srinath Ravichandran called it the culmination of the team’s thousands of hours of reviews and hard work. Co-founder and COO Moin SPM said the project owes its success to the unwavering support of the firm’s advisors, investors, vendors, customers and well-wishers.Unlike traditional-sounding rockets that launch from guiderails, SOrTeD lifted off vertically and followed a predetermined trajectory while performing a precisely orchestrated set of manoeuvres during flight.Isro chairman S Somanath said: “The Department of Space and Isro congratulate Agnikul. The success involved many firsts, including a 3D-printed semi-cryogenic engine, flight-control systems demonstrating the prowess of indigenous design and innovation. It motivates Isro to support space startups and non-governmental entities for innovation to create a vibrant space ecosystem in the country.”The Agnikul team, consisting of more than 200 engineers, is guided by 45 former Isro scientists. Satyanarayanan R Chakravarthy of IIT-Madras (IITM), Agnikul’s founding advisor, said the firm was proud to present India’s first semi-cryo rocket engine, which is also the world’s most integrated single-shot 3D-printed piece. “It signals the ability to rapidly assemble rockets that is unparalleled.”IITM director V Kamakoti noted the sky was no longer the limit for startups. “Very innovative, first time in the world, deep-core technology demonstrated today by Agnikul – a great inspiration for all young students to boldly take the entrepreneurship route and become employers,” Kamakoti said.The success takes Agnikul a step closer to test-flying its flagship launch vehicle Agnibaan, a two-stage rocket designed to be highly customisable. “It is compatible with the mobile launchpad Dhanush, allowing for launch flexibility regardless of location and accommodating payloads ranging from 30kg to 300kg,” Agnikul said.The firm has plans for an orbital mission towards the end of the financial year 2024-25 and regular customer flights from 2025.Aside from showcasing the country’s first semi-cryogenic engine-powered rocket launch and utilising the first single-piece 3D-printed engine, SOrTeD had another first — Dhanush, established at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Isro’s spaceport in Sriharikota, on Nov 25, 2022.Conceived and built as a product that enables the process of launching to be reliable and repeatable with consistency, Dhanush has two sections: The Agnikul Launch Pad (ALP) and the Agnikul mission control centre (AMCC). Critical systems connecting these two sections, which are 4km from each other, are designed to ensure 100% operationality during countdown.IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka said: “The successful launch of SOrTeD is not just a milestone for Agnikul but marks a significant moment for private players contributing to growing India’s space sector… At IN-SPACe, we are committed to support all young pioneers as they help propel India to a leadership position in the global space arena.”","Agnikul Cosmos, an IIT-Madras-incubated startup, successfully launched on Thursday the world’s first rocket with a single-piece 3D-printed engine.
