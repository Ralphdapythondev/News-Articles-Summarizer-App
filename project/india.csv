Army helps ring in mobile connectivity in Ladakh’s border villages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-helps-ring-in-mobile-connectivity-in-ladakhs-border-villages/articleshow/112821523.cms,"NEW DELHI: We have seen the Indian Army stepping up to help civil authorities with relief and rescue operations during natural disasters or quell civic unrest. But in Ladakh , in addition to defending the border, it has also played a pivotal role in bringing mobile connectivity in forward villages.Since 2017, the Army has forged a unique collaboration with locals by providing optical fibre links for mobile service in three isolated villages in the Chushul constituency of LAHDC (Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council).The optical fibre link has been a dealbreaker for telecom operators as the thin population in the isolated villages makes laying optic-fibre lines through the mountainous terrain expensive and the service unremunerative for them.Under a civil-military partnership initiative piloted by Konchok Stanzin, who represents the constituency in LAHDC, mobile service was launched in the three villages with contribution from all stakeholders. Stanzin used his Constituency Development Fund to support construction of the power supply system, while the Army provided the optical fibre link and the telecom operator put up the mobile tower.Phobrang, a remote village 158 kms east of Leh, became the latest beneficiary of this initiative last week when Airtel launched 4G service in the area that serves as the gateway to the military hot spots of Gogra and Hot Springs in the northern bank of Pangong lake.“This achievement is a testament to the power of collective effort and the importance of connecting even the most remote parts of the country to the digital world,” Stanzin said after inaugurating the service last Wednesday to mark the first instance of such collaboration with a private operator.In this case, Stanzin funded a solar power plant from his Constituency Development Fund and the villagers built a battery bank to ensure 24X7 supply, while the Army laid a 5 km-long optical fibre cable to connect the mobile tower put up by Airtel.As reported by TOI on April 13, 2021, Stanzin had earlier successfully used the formula to bring state-run BSNL’s 2G service at Merak, a village facing the Finger areas of Pangong. In this case, the Army pitched in by allotting capacity for civilian traffic in a 25-Km fibre optic link to Chushul.In 2017, the same formula led to the launch of BSNL service in Kargyam area, which lies along the alternative road connecting Chushul with 114 Brigade headquarters at Tangtse.4G mobile connectivity in Phobrang will be especially helpful for graziers during the winter and also go a long way in boosting tourism in the area. In addition to these villages, Chushul, Demchok and Nyoma in forward areas of eastern Ladakh that are open for tourists now have 4G service from private operators set up with support from the USO (Universal Service Obligation) Fund.",The Army has forged a unique collaboration with locals by providing optical fibre links for mobile service in three isolated villages. The optical fibre link has been a dealbreaker for telecom operators as the thin population in the isolated villages makes laying optic-fibre lines expensive and the service unremunerative for them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112821566,imgsize-87648,width-400,resizemode-4/112821566.jpg"

Education ministry withholds SSA funds to TN for not accepting NEP provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/education-ministry-withholds-ssa-funds-to-tn-for-not-accepting-nep-provisions/articleshow/112818894.cms,"CHENNAI: The Union education ministry has withheld the first instalment of Rs 573 crore under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to Tamil Nadu for not accepting provisions of the National Education Policy ( NEP ), such as the three-language formula in the PM Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) scheme.The Project Approval Board has allocated a sum of Rs 3,586 crore under SSA to the state for 2024-2025.Of this amount, the Centre 's contribution is Rs 2,152 crore (60%), to be released in four instalments, while state govt's share is Rs1,434 crore (40%). The first instalment should have been received in June, but central govt is yet to respond to the letters and reminders from Tamil Nadu on releasing the amount.With no funds, 15,000-odd teachers including block resource teacher educators (BRTEs), part-time teachers and special teachers, may not get their salary next month.

Kolkata: New Details About August 9 Horror At RG Kar Hospital Out

Sexual assault of patients inside hospitals is far from uncommon as is clear from these newspaper reports of cases from across India. Yet, there have been no studies on sexual assault of patients. On the other hand, there is an abundance of studies and research on violence that health workers, especially doctors and nurses, suffer at the hands of patients and/or their relatives.In fact, there is hardly any research on violence of any kind against patients in India, whether verbal, physical or sexual, with the exception of a few studies on 'obstetric violence' defined as violence against women by health care providers during childbirth, and on violence against patients with psychiatric ailments.In the few studies that exist, even sexual assault or molestation of patients is described euphemistically as ""sexual boundary violations"". Similarly, there is some pushback against the use of the term obstetric violence with a preference for the term 'mistreatment'.In the context of obstetric violence, studies have recorded how patients and their relatives are verbally abused and humiliated by healthcare providers and how they are physically abused in the way pelvic examinations are done and the general 'rough treatment' meted out to the pregnant women. However, patients' advocates point out that such verbal and physical abuse is common even in non-obstetric settings in the hospital.TOI sought the help of several health researchers to look for studies on violence against patients. ""The literature is scarce. Why would perpetrators document their wrongs?"" asked one of the researchers. Most of the research on healthcare is done by health providers and they are unlikely to be researching their own wrongdoings, remarked another.""Medicine in India is paternalistic and the providers don't feel the need to involve patients as equals in the process of treatment. There are so many forms of violence against patients, both systemic and structural, and they need to be documented, just like in the studies on violence against health workers, and the reasons and the context need to be studied. The violence is an open secret that is all too familiar to patients, but somehow there is no appetite for research on this. Patients are powerless and their families are mostly scared to speak up as they fear retaliation against their loved ones who are in the care of the hospital and at the mercy of the doctors and nurses. There is no system for grievance redressal and hence no data on the violence they face,"" said Malini Aisola, of the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare.""Independently validated and objective reporting of patients' concerns does not exist; in the given climate, no organisation is prepared to report the data publicly, even if it collects data properly in the first instance,"" observed a rare study on patient safety in India.","There is hardly any research on violence of any kind against patients in India, whether verbal, physical or sexual.

"Unified Pension Scheme vs OPS vs NPS: How is UPS different from National Pension Scheme, Old Pension Scheme?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unified-pension-scheme-vs-ops-vs-nps-how-is-ups-different-from-national-pension-scheme-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/112796028.cms,"UPS vs OPS vs NPS

:

Unified Pension Scheme (UPS): Top Features

Under the UPS, employees with a minimum qualifying service of 25 years will receive an assured pension of 50% of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to superannuation.

For service periods between 10 and 25 years, the pension will be proportional.

In the event of an employee's demise, their family will receive an assured pension of 60% of the employee's pension immediately before their demise.

The scheme also includes an assured minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service.

The UPS will apply inflation indexation to the assured pension, assured family pension, and assured minimum pension.

Dearness Relief will be based on the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW), similar to service employees.

Additionally, employees will receive a lump sum payment at superannuation, calculated as 1/10th of monthly emoluments (pay + DA) for every completed six months of service. This lump sum payment is separate from gratuity and does not impact the assured pension amount.

Employees choosing the UPS will not incur any extra financial burden. Their contribution will stay at 10 percent, while the government's contribution will rise from 14 percent to 18.5 percent.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Top Features

Under NPS, central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government contributes 14%, according to an ET report.

The pension amount in NPS is not fixed as it is linked to market movements, whereas UPS provides an assured pension of 50% of the salary for those who joined the service after January 1, 2004.

Family pension under NPS depends on the accumulated corpus in the pension fund and the chosen annuity plan at retirement.

NPS has been implemented for all government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined the central government on or after January 1, 2004. It is also available for private-sector employees. Most state/Union Territory governments have also notified NPS for their new employees.

Old Pension Scheme (OPS): Top Features

The Old Pension Scheme (OPS) provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 percent of their last drawn salary. This amount was subject to increase in line with the hike in the Dearness Allowance (DA) rates. Upon retirement, employees were also entitled to receive a gratuity payment, with a maximum limit of Rs 20 lakh.

Under the OPS, if a retired employee passed away, their family would continue to receive pension benefits. Another notable aspect of the OPS was that no deductions were made from an employee's salary towards pension contributions, which is in contrast to the NPS.

The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees who joined the service after January 1, 2004. This scheme, which will be implemented from April 1, 2025, guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the basic salary. The decision to introduce UPS comes in response to several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.Employees have the option to choose between UPS and NPS.So how does UPS compare to NPS? And how does it compare to the OPS? We take a look:NPS and the newly proposed UPS differ in terms of government contributions, pension amounts, and family pension provisions.Recently, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Punjab, have made the decision to revert to the Old Pension Scheme, moving away from the NPS.","The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

KRISHNAGIRI: The fake NCC officer, Sivaraman, 35, arrested for raping school girls at unauthorised NCC camps at two private schools in Krishnagiri district, died early on Friday in a hospital where he was being treated for consuming rat poison.A few hours before that his father Ashok Kumar, 61, fell off his moped and died near Kaveripattinam. Police said he was drunk.AIADMK and BJP said they suspect the deaths were part of an attempt to protect influential people involved in the case.Krishnagiri district superintendent of police P Thangadurai warned of stringent action against people spreading false information about the deaths.State BJP president K Annamalai said Sivaraman might have been murdered to prevent him from disclosing the identities of key people involved in the case.""There are doubts whether all accused in the case have been arrested, and whether the deaths of the father-son duo were orchestrated to protect someone,"" Annamalai said and called on the special investigation team formed by the chief minister to uncover the truth.AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami asked whether police were attempting to protect influential people involved in the conduct of the unauthorised NCC camps. ""Chief minister M K Stalin should disclose the truth to the people of Tamil Nadu ,"" Palaniswami said.Thangadurai said Sivaraman had consumed rat poison on Aug 16 and on Aug 18 to end his life, fearing arrest in the rape case. ""He disclosed it to doctors on Monday, when he was admitted to the govt hospital in Krishnagiri with a fractured leg. We shifted him to the govt hospital in Salem on Wednesday for advanced treatment. However, his condition deteriorated and he died at 5.30am on Friday, despite doctors performing dialysis twice,"" the SP said. Sivaraman had attempted suicide by consuming rat poison on July 9 over a family dispute and was treated at a private hospital, he added.The SP said Sivaraman's father died around 10.15pm on Thursday after he fell off his moped while returning home after consuming alcohol. ""When he neared Therpatty near Kaveripattinam, he lost control of the moped and fell. He succumbed to head injuries on the spot. A CCTV camera at a nearby medical store captured the entire incident,"" Thangadurai said.The two bodies were handed over to the family after a postmortem on Friday evening. Padma, 55, Sivaraman's mother, said it was she who had reported her husband's death to the Kaveripattinam police on Thursday night.

Is UPS a Step Backward?

The government has recently introduced the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an alternative to the existing National Pension System (NPS) for its employees. With this new scheme set to roll out in April 2025, employees who joined after 2004 now face a crucial decision. Should they stick with NPS or switch to the new UPS? Here's a detailed comparison to help you make an informed choice.The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced in 2004 as a defined contribution scheme, replacing the Old Pension Scheme (OPS).Under NPS, employees contribute 10% of their salary, while the government contributes 14%. The corpus is invested in a mix of government securities, equities, and corporate bonds, similar to mutual funds. Upon retirement, 40% of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity.The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), on the other hand, offers a guaranteed pension of 50% of the average pay for the last 12 months for employees who have served for 25 years or more. The government’s contribution under UPS is set at 18.5%, with the employee's contribution remaining at 10%. Additionally, UPS includes a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000 for those who have worked for at least 10 years, along with a lump sum retirement benefit.The UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits. Here's a breakdown:Employees with at least 25 years of service will receive a guaranteed pension of 50% of their average basic pay.In case of an employee's death, their spouse will receive a family pension of 60% of the employee's pension.Employees with at least 10 years of service will receive a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month.Both the assured pension and family pension will be adjusted for inflation.Retirees under the UPS will receive Dearness Relief.Employees will receive a lump sum payment at retirement.One of the most significant advantages of UPS is the increased government contribution of 18.5%, compared to 14% under NPS. This boost in contribution is expected to result in a larger pension corpus, ensuring better financial security post-retirement.UPS guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the average salary over the last 12 months of service. This assurance makes UPS a safer option for risk-averse employees, particularly given the market volatility that can impact the returns on NPS investments.For employees with at least 10 years of service, UPS offers a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000, providing a safety net for lower-earning employees. Additionally, the scheme includes a lump sum payment at retirement, linked to the duration of service, offering further financial support.While UPS offers a guaranteed pension, it limits the potential for higher returns that NPS might offer through market-linked investments. Under NPS, employees can choose from various investment options, including up to 65% in government securities, 15% in equities, and the remainder in corporate bonds. However, these investments are subject to market risks, and the final pension amount may vary.In contrast, UPS protects employees from market fluctuations, providing a stable and predictable income stream in retirement. For many, especially those nearing retirement, this stability may outweigh the potential for higher returns under NPS.Some may argue that UPS represents a step back from the market-linked reforms introduced with NPS. However, UPS retains the core principle of a defined contribution scheme, with additional safeguards to ensure a minimum pension. It also addresses the growing demand for a guaranteed pension among government employees, without reverting to the unfunded liabilities of the Old Pension Scheme.","The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) is an alternative to the existing National Pension System (NPS) UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits.

Nabanna Abhijan Rally illegal, says West Bengal ADGP; BJP calls it 'spineless police force'

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress on Monday accused the Bhartiya Janta Party of planning to orchestrate ruckus during the ""apolitical"" Nabanna Abhiyan rally scheduled for August 27. The saffron party reacted to this saying that Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee would single-handedly be responsible for any violence at the rally.TMC also alleged the saffron party of playing ""vulture politics"" over the students' protest in a bid ""to plunge Bengal into chaos.""The rally has been organised by ‘ Chhatra Samaj or Student Society’ in the backdrop of rape and murder of doctor at RG Kar College and Hospital in Kolkata.TMC posted a video of a person who is heard saying that the rally is not meant to ""peaceful"". ""Gun shots will be fired; rubber bullets will be fired,"" the English subtitles suggest as the person is supposedly talking to a reporter. TOI could not verify the authenticity of the video.""'Dead bodies must fall' for 'political momentum.' - SHOCKING videos have emerged indicating a sinister conspiracy behind the Nabanna Abhiyan tomorrow! BJP has resorted to the politics of DEAD BODIES under the camouflage of JUSTICE! Instead of asking CBI to expedite the probe, this is what the BJP is busy doing,"" the post accompanying the video reads.Calling it a ""well choreographed"" video, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said, ""Mamata Banerjee thinks such juvenile antics are going to deter people from seeking justice for the RG Kar victim and her resignation? NO. It strengthens our resolve even more.""Now, the TMC official handle has put out a well choreographed, edited and subtitled video, indicating violence on 27th and trying to blame the BJP for it,"" he said.Asserting that the ""apolitical student protest will go on"", Malviya said, ""It has support of entire West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee alone will be responsible for ANY violence.""West Bengal ADG Police (Law & Order) Manoj Kumar Verma said that Nabanna Abhijan rally was illegal, adding that it was an attempt to incite widespread unrest in Kolkata. He said that Nabanna is a restricted area, and no organization has applied for permission to hold a protest near the state secretariat.Launching a sharp attack on the state police, Amit Malviya said that since the rally has been announced, it has given ""sleepless nights to Mamata Banerjee and her spineless police force"".""Then WB Police put out a note expressing apprehensions regarding the UGC-NET exam. It is their responsibility to ensure exams happen on schedule. But the BJP has announced a student helpline for assistance, since WB Police is incompetent and is freezing in their boots,"" he said.The Bengal ADGP said that while peaceful protests are permitted in specific designated areas of Kolkata, such as those related to incidents like the one at RG Kar Medical College, Nabanna remains off-limits for demonstrations. This is due to the enforcement of Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, which replaces the former Section 144 of the CrPC.","All India Trinamool Congress accused Bhartiya Janta Party of planning to orchestrate ruckus during the ""apolitical"" Nabanna Abhiyan rally scheduled for August 27.

"Release, withdraw, re-release: Protests over J&K candidates list force rare BJP flip-flop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/release-withdraw-re-release-protests-over-jk-candidates-list-force-rare-bjp-flip-flop/articleshow/112814592.cms,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday released the first list of 44 candidates for the upcoming J&K assembly elections, a day after the party's top brass led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting over the names. However, in a rare turn of events, the party was forced to withdraw the original list and release a new one with just 15 names for the first phase of elections.The party then released another list with just one name.The hasty retreat was triggered by protests at party's headquarters in Jammu - a rare public show of anger against the decision of the top leadership. There have not been many instances of such open dissent within the BJP in the last 10 years. In fact, the BJP has often taken digs at opposition parties, including the Congress, for failing to enforce discipline within its ranks.However, this is not the first time that the BJP has made a U-turn in the recent past. The third term of the party at the Centre has been marked by quite a few instances when the party has been forced to make a retreat.The BJP which pushed through its governance agenda with gusto in the first two terms, is coming to terms with the realities of coalition compulsion despite all the bravado of ""business as usual."" PM Modi is dependent on allies for the survival of his third government and hence can not afford to ignore their concerns.The first U-turn made by the BJP government was its decision to put on hold UPSC's ""lateral entry"" move to induct 45 officers. With the opposition parties accusing the government of using lateral entry to bypass reservations and some key allies echoing similar views - the Modi government was quick to request the UPSC to withdraw the advertisement.Then there was the Waqf Bill, which was introduced in Parliament to bring about transparency in the functioning of the Waqf boards at the state level, was sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for further discussions. Incidentally, in the first two terms of the government, when the BJP had majority on its own, not many bills were sent to the JPC despite several opposition demands. However, with BJP’s own allies favouring a detailed debate on the proposed changes, the government had little option.The Congress has claimed that government's decision to launch the Unified Pension Scheme - guaranteeing pension to govt employees - was another policy decision influenced by the allies. BJP's earlier position was that the National Pension System (NPS), introduced in 2004, was a ""revolutionary thing"" and was good for state finances.The UPS assures a lifelong pension of 50 per cent of the last drawn salary while under NPS pension was linked to the accumulated value of the contributions made by the employee and the government during the former's working life. The NPS, on the other hand, is based on defined contributions by employees and employers, which are invested in selected funds, with the pension amount depending on the returns on those investments.Modi 3.0 dependence on allies was reflected in the first Union Budget of the current term when two critical ally states - Andhra Pradesh and Bihar got special allowances and key projects. Both Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar had demanded special status for their states. While the Modi government did not announce that it ensured that the two leaders were kept in good humour.Clearly, the way ahead is not going to be easy and Modi 3.0 will have to continue to keep all the allies in good humour making this government more of NDA 3.0. And while coalition pressure will continue to be there, the BJP top leadership would not want any additional pressures from within that sends out ""weak"" signals.",BJP forced to withdraw the original list and release a new one with just 15 names for the first phase of elections. The hasty retreat was triggered by protests at party's headquarters in Jammu.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday reprimanded party MP Kangana Ranaut and distanced itself from her controversial remarks suggesting that farmers' protests could have led to a Bangladesh-like situation in the country if the BJP's top leadership was not strong enough.“The statement made by BJP MP Kangana Ranaut in the context of the farmers' movement is not the opinion of the party.The Bharatiya Janata Party expresses its disagreement with the statement made by Kangana Ranaut,” the BJP said in a statement. ""Kangana Ranaut is neither permitted nor authorised to make statements on party's policy. She has been directed not to make such statement in future,"" the party added.In a video shared on X, Mandi MP Kangana Ranaut had alleged that “bodies were hanging and rapes were taking place” during the farmers' protest against the now-repealed three farm laws. ""There was a long planning behind all this like in Bangladesh . The farmers had never thought that the three bills which were introduced by the government to help them would be withdrawn. But they are still sitting there,"" she said. The BJP MP also claimed that China, America, and other foreign powers were involved in this conspiracy to destroy the country with the help of insiders.The Congress reacted strongly to Kangana's remarks. Responding to her post, senior Congress leader Surjewala wrote on X, “After all, why do BJP people hate the country's food providers so much? The BJP has always lied, deceived, conspired and oppressed our farmers. And once again a BJP MP has made baseless allegations against our food providers.

"Pollution leading to rise in mortality risk across all age groups, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-new-study-flags-direct-link-of-air-pollution-with-rise-in-mortality-in-india-congress-slams-govt-for-being-in-denial/articleshow/112814975.cms,"Delhi, Mumbai among cities with pollution mortality risk

NEW DELHI: A new study conducted by the researchers of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences ( IIPS ) and other scientific institutions shows that the air pollution in India poses a significant threat to human health, leading to a substantial rise in mortality observed for all age‐groups in the districts with the critical pollutant PM2.5 levels exceeding the acceptable limit under the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).The study, using the govt mortality and socio-demographic data from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) 2019-2021, shows the highest over two fold increase (119%) in the odds of mortality (risk) among children in the age group of one to five years followed by 104% rise in infants up to one year, 86% increase in newborns less than 30 days old and 13% rise in adults in the districts where the PM2.5 levels crossed the acceptable annual average limit of 40 μg/m3. The statistical comparison was made from the districts where the PM2.5 levels remained within 10 μg/m3.If one looks at PM2.5 data of major cities, the finding means that such a mortality risk can be noticed in many big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Kolkata, Patna, Ranchi and Ahmedabad among others where the pollutant levels crossed the acceptable limits even during the Covid pandemic year.The study, published last week in the journal GeoHealth, took both the ambient and household air pollutant data from the Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model and correlated it with the NFHS data to arrive at its conclusion saying the ""interaction between elevated PM2.5 levels and household air pollution further amplifies mortality risks""..The scientific findings of IIPS study assume significance as the govt has invariably denied any direct link of air pollution with mortality. During the budget session in July, the environment ministry in written response to a question said, ""There is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution.""Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals apart from the environment.""The ministry's response came to a question on the study published in The Lancet Planetary Health Journal that claimed that 7.2% of all daily deaths in 10 of the largest and most polluted cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, in India were linked to PM2.5 levels. The ministry noted that the Lancet finding was ""based on study conducted using statistical models"" and cited its limitations, saying the study was unable to conduct analysis of cause-specific mortality.Underlining the findings of the IIPS study, Congress member in Rajya Sabha and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday criticised the Centre over its approach to deal with the ""rapidly deteriorating air quality"" in the country and said, ""This government's modus operandi is to deny that there is a real air pollution-linked mortality problem, underfund programmes targeted at mitigating pollution, fail to utilize the resources that it allocates, and misuse the funds that do get spent.""Ramesh also suggested eight-point measures to prevent such a crisis in India, saying the first step must be to acknowledge the public health crisis linked to air pollution across wide swathes of India. ""We must revisit and totally revamp both the Air Pollution (Control and Prevention) Act of 1981 and the NAAQS put into effect in November 2009,"" he said.His other suggestions include higher allocation of fund under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), adopting measurement of PM2.5 levels as the yardstick for performance, reorientation of NCAP to focus on all sources of emissions, adoption of airshed approach for air quality control, legal backing to NCAP and strict enforcement of air pollution norms for coal power plants.Though all air pollutants - nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxides (SO2), volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aro-matic hydrocarbons - are significantly associated with morbidity and mortality, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm, has been studied most intensively and used as a representative indicator of exposure to air pollution and its association with various morbidity conditions.Researchers involved in the study include Mihir Adhikary and Nandita Saikia of the department of public health and mortality at IISA, Mumbai; Pallav Purohit and Wolfgang Schopp of the Pollution Management Research Group, Energy, Climate and Environment (ECE) Programmes, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria; and Vladimir Canudas-Romo of the School of Demography, ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.Referring to their findings, they suggested the policymakers should focus on reducing the anthropogenic PM2.5 emission at least to reach the NAAQS, which can substantially reduce disease burden and, more precisely, mortality.",A new study shows that air pollution in India poses a significant threat to human health. The study shows the highest over two fold increase (119%) in the odds of mortality (risk) among children in the age group of one to five years.

SFF

men ‘arbitrary’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has directed the govt to extend sixth pay commission benefits, including pensionary benefits, to personnel engaged to manage savings scheme deposits (SSD) of Special Frontier Force.Six SSD personnel were recruited on a temporary basis in the 1970s. The UPA govt had denied service benefits and pension to these personnel when they retired, even though they had served for over 30 years.The Armed Forces Tribunal had upheld the govt's decision, following which the SSD personnel appealed in the SC.Six SSD personnel, who were recruited on temporary basis in 1970s, were receiving travel allowance, dearness allowance, house rent allowance, special security allowance, gratuity, bonus, winter allowance and high-altitude allowance along with salary as per fourth and fifth pay commissions.However, when the sixth pay commission was implemented for SFF personnel, these SSD personnel were not given any allowance and instead paid a consolidated Rs 3,000 per month. When they retired after serving SFF for more than 30 years, they demanded pension as per sixth pay commission. But their representation was rejected by the govt in 2012.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Sandeep Meha, in a 30-page analysis of the SSD employees’ case, found that the govt had consistently treated them as regular employees. “The mere classification of employees as ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’ is not merely a matter of nomenclature but carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of the service benefits and protections,” it said.Justice Mehta said, “In the present case, the totality of circumstances indicates that despite their formal classification as temporary employees , appellants’ employment bears substantial hallmarks of regular govt service. “Denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status, without due consideration of these factors, appears to be an oversimplification of their employment relation with govt. This approach runs the risk of creating a class of employees who, despite serving the govt for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular employees, are deprived of the benefits and protections typically accorded to govt servants.”Justices Kohli and Mehta said, “We are of the opinion that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants is not tenable or justifiable in the eyes of law as the same is arbitrary and violates the fundamental rights as guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.”","Six SSD personnel were recruited on a temporary basis in the 1970s.

"Indian, Chinese warships dock in Colombo, send out ripples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-chinese-warships-dock-in-colombo-send-out-ripples/articleshow/112817022.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 'Great Game' between India and China for strategic influence in the Indian Ocean Region ( IOR ) continues, while their troops remain locked in a military confrontation along the land borders.The docking of a frontline Indian warship, guided-missile destroyer INS Mumbai, at Colombo on Monday morning coincided with three Chinese warships doing the same, generating some waves in the neighbourhood.""Chinese warships, including those part of its anti-piracy escort forces, are now staying in the IOR for a much longer time than earlier,"" an Indian defence establishment official said.""The expanding Chinese naval presence in the IOR, along with Beijing's hunt for additional logistical turnaround facilities in the region, has become a major challenge for India,"" he added. To be sure, the 140-warship Indian Navy certainly needs adequate force-levels to ""take care"" of Pakistan and ""deter"" China in the IOR.The Indian Navy closely tracked the three Chinese warships, destroyer Hefei, and landing platform docks (amphibious ships) Wuzhishan and Qilianshan, with a combined crew of almost 1,500 personnel, right from the moment they entered the IOR till their docking at Colombo on Monday morning.Sri Lanka welcomed INS Mumbai, which is commanded by Captain Sandeep Kumar with a crew of 410 sailors, as well as the Chinese warships ""in compliance with naval traditions"". INS Mumbai and the Chinese warships are scheduled to separately hold ""passage exercises"" with Sri Lankan warships on their departure, again coinciding on August 29.Having already lost out to Beijing in the Maldives, with the Mohamed Muizzu govt signing a defence cooperation pact with China and forcing India to withdraw its military personnel operating a Dornier aircraft and two advanced light helicopters, the docking of Chinese warships at Colombo will obviously not go well down with New Delhi. India, in the past, had registered its strong protest with Colombo when it had permitted Chinese warships, spy vessels and submarines to dock at Lankan ports.Amid this strategic tussle, all eyes are now on the Sri Lankan Presidential elections slated for Sept 21. For India, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is still a better bet than Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People's Power, which is perceived to be pro-China.With the world's largest Navy with over 360 warships and submarines, China has been steadily bolstering its ""underwater domain awareness"" in the IOR through its almost permanent deployment of survey and research 'spy' vessels in the region to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations, as reported by TOI earlier.The fast expanding China-Pakistan collusiveness in the maritime domain is also a major concern. China is helping Pakistan build a strong Navy, having already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates, with eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines also in the pipeline. ""By 2028-29, Pakistan will have the same number of assets as India's Western Naval Command,"" an officer said.","The docking of a frontline Indian warship, guided-missile destroyer INS Mumbai, at Colombo on Monday morning coincided with three Chinese warships.

We took stock of progress in our bilateral relations and cooperation in the multilateral fora, including the Quad,” said Modi in a post on X.While neither side said that the leaders discussed the possibility of an early Quad summit , the talks took place in the middle of efforts to have the delayed summit on the margins of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York next month.With Modi set to represent India at the UNGA, India is keen to host the summit on the sidelines there. As the US will remain preoccupied with the upcoming presidential elections for the next few months, this may effectively be the last chance for India to host the summit this year.It was India’s turn to host the summit in 2024 but President Joe Biden’s inability to visit India in January coupled with India’s own elections in May put paid to the hopes of having the meeting in the first half of the year. India explored the possibility of hosting the meeting on the margins of the G7 summit in June in Italy but that didn’t materialise because Australia wasn’t invited for G7.Hopes of having the summit on the margins of UNGA were rekindled this month after Japan PM Fumio Kishida decided to travel to the US to address the Assembly for what will be his last overseas trip as PM. Kishida is not seeking reelection in the ruling LDP presidential poll on September 27 and will step down as PM after his return from the US. Interestingly, former Japan PM Yoshihide Suga too had travelled to the US in September, 2021, to participate in the first in-person Quad summit just before he stepped down.Amid Chinese assertiveness, Quad is being seen as playing an increasingly important role in ensuring a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is resilient and free from coercion.In a first, India joined other Quad nations last month in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes. Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone.",PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese Monday about bilateral ties and also cooperation under the Quad mechanism.

Days after his return from Ukraine , PM Narendra Modi briefed US President Joe Biden about his landmark visit to Kyiv, reiterating India’s “consistent” position in favour of dialogue and diplomacy and expressing full support for early return of peace and stability. During the conversation initiated by Biden, the leaders also shared concern over the situation in Bangladesh and emphasised restoration of law and order, along with the need to ensure safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus , according to an Indian readout.The conversation took place ahead of a possible bilateral meeting between the leaders, and a proposed Quad summit, next month in New York on the sidelines of the upcoming UNGA session. Modi and Biden also committed to strengthening Quad cooperation.The rare mention of security for Hindus in Bangladesh in a conversation with a foreign leader is in line with India’s stated priority of ensuring their safety in the crisis-ridden country. In his congratulatory message on X to Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Modi had called for protection of the Hindu community. However, Yunus later told him a phone conversation that reports of attacks on minorities are exaggerated.“We had a detailed exchange of views on various regional and global issues, including the situation in Ukraine. I reiterated India’s full support for early return of peace and stability. We also discussed the situation in Bangladesh and stressed on the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh,” said Modi in a post on X.The talks on the Ukraine issue are also significant as Modi’s visit to Kyiv followed an outrage in the Western world, led by the US, over the timing of the visit. The US was upset that it was timed with the NATO summit in Washington. That Modi chose Russia for his first bilateral visit in his third term, and a Russian attack on a children hospital the day Modi landed in Moscow, only exacerbated this sentiment. There was no dramatic shift in India’s position though as Modi expressed solidarity with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy but also told him he needed to talk to Russia for early return of peace. India maintains it’s important to involve Russia for enduring peace. White House has described Modi’s visit as “potentially helpful”.“PM conveyed his appreciation for President Biden’s deep commitment the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, which is based on shared values of democracy, rule of law and strong people-to-people ties,” said the Indian readout.The leaders , it added, reviewed the significant progress in bilateral relations and highlighted that India-US partnership is aimed at benefiting the people of both countries as well as the entire humanity.",PM Narendra Modi briefed US President Joe Biden about his landmark visit to Kyiv.

Despite the evolving workplace, women still face significant challenges when considering a change in their professional paths. However, there are success stories that highlight the possibility of overcoming these hurdles with determination and support.A recent study reveals that over 70% of women encounter significant challenges when contemplating a career switch .Many struggle with balancing family responsibilities and societal expectations. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, only 30% of women successfully switch careers, compared to more than 50% of men.While career switching remains challenging for women, some have excelled in making this transition. For instance, Mahika Shah, who transformed her career from a businesswoman and architect to a Vastu consultant, and now, an aspiring actress. Reflecting on her decision, she said, ""It wasn't easy, but following my passion has been incredibly rewarding.""Shah also noted, ""Career switching is a crucial and sensitive decision for women. They often have to rise above societal and familial pressures to make it. A strong mindset and proper guidance are essential for navigating this path successfully.""Though the trend of women switching careers is gradually increasing, there is still much work to be done. More opportunities and support systems are needed to empower women to make career decisions without fear or hesitation.","Only 30% of women successfully switch careers, compared to more than 50% of men.

Venkataramani stressed on the need for responsible tourism. He emphasized that India would continue to play a role in building a cohesive and peaceful world, wherein tourism would be a key factor.""India is beginning to build a world of togetherness. So, how do we therefore build a world of togetherness in which all of us have equal regard. Each country, each community, each faith have equal regard for each and every one of us. And from that equal regard what we get is equal reward for our relationships. It can be equal reward in terms of market, in terms of commerce, industry. So I think India stands for equal regard and equal reward principle and I think tourism is probably one umbrella where we can talk more and more about it. And to project India's position in it.""""I think it's important for us to spread this message of goodwill and togetherness. What else can be a better package than a tourism package? I think all of us can build into it, weave into it and be part of India's global journey towards a higher level of togetherness at the global level.""Speaking at the programme, Lalit Bhasin, Immediate Past National President of IACC outlined his association with the tourism and hospitality space. ""My association with tourism, hospitality was nearly 6 decades, when I started practicing law,"" he said.In a panel discussion on ""Outbound Tourism, India to USA"", Suman Billa, Additional Secretary, Union Ministry of Tourism highlighted the strong bilateral partnership and the growth in travel between the two countries, there is significant headroom for progress in this space.""So there's a lot that is happening based in India and I think it is a little bit surprising even though the numbers are good. If you look at from a tourism perspective, we really have not capitalized on the potential that we have. I think judging by the potential of what we have, there is probably much more headroom for us to capture,"" Billa said, adding that the growth in the Indian economy is unlikely to slow down adding all the more potential for growth in outbound tourism.""India has been the fastest growing of the lot. And nothing in the market seems to suggest that it is going to slow down. So I think our natural affinity to the US will draw us closer and will open more pathways for us to explore and I think tourism should be one of those pathways which will open the doors for the possibility, but to build more understanding between the people of India and the United States,"" he added.He noted that although a US visa is valid for 10 years, not requiring any frequent updates by a visa holder, the process of getting the visa for the world's largest economy is a cumbersome and tiresome process. He also stressed on the need for more direct flights between India and the US.Jonathan M Heimer, minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs, India US Commercial Service, however, noted that over the past one year, the pace of visa application processing has gained momentum leading to record visa issuances. ""On the backend for the application processing, we've been able to process something like 60% more visas with more or less the same resources. And also we have issued more than 1.1 million visas in the last year, which for us, is a record and that's just going to continue to go up that number,"" Heimer added.In his response to the issue of the visa application process, Rajesh Magow, Co-Founder & Group CEO, MakeMyTrip Limited suggested the introduction of short term visas for tourists.""There are many other countries which have done it, maybe short-term tourist visas can be quick, maybe that could be one potential innovation that can happen as well,"" he said. Speaking in favour of boosting international tourism he said that international travel is not growing at the cost of domestic travel.Talking on the revival of air travel from the Covid-induced slowdown, Harvinder Singh, Director India & Middle East, United Airlines noted that all the three key segments of air travel -- business, students and leisure -- have picked up and gained momentum.""What we see in terms of the segmentation is business, there is the student along with the leisure part and what we have really observed is all these segments are actually going,"" he said. Singh also stressed on the need for better customer experience with the help of newer technologies and other resources.",India and the US have a lot of unexploited potential in the tourism and hospitality space. More direct flights between the two countries and swifter visa application process is the need of the hour to boost the segment.
