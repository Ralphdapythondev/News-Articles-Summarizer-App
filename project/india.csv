Change Begins Here: 45 lakh and still counting- the Kudumbashree ambassadors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-begins-here-45-lakh-and-still-counting-the-kudumbashree-ambassadors/articleshow/113889901.cms,"NEVER-SAY-DIE: Bindu Pallichal with Kudumbashree members at their unit (top); Members participating in a food festival

When she was 15, Bindu Pallichal, from a remote village in the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, started giving tuitions to fund her impending college education and help her family that had limited financial resources. Little did she know then that one day, with govt support, she would set up her own business — applying her subject knowledge in Sanskrit and putting a family secret in making hair oil to entrepreneurial use.In 2007, when she joined Kudumbashree Mission, one of the world’s largest networks of women-run initiatives helmed by the govt of Kerala under its Local Self Govt Department (LSGD), Bindu’s only aim was to ensure her children didn’t grow up with a below-poverty-line tag.Seventeen years have passed since those baby steps. Today, Bindu is a proud entrepreneur, travelling to places, delivering motivational lectures, and training women on financial independence. She started off by selling herbal oil, going from door to door and earning around Rs 20,000 a month. Now, she manufactures a range of products — from herbal oils and jams to health drinks — and boasts of a monthly income of Rs 2 lakh. There are other women, all Kudumbashree members, who are helping her in her enterprise called Ayuraj Industries Pvt Ltd.Bindu’s isn’t the only success story, though. In the last 26 years, Kudumbashree, that celebrated its silver jubilee in 2023, has reached out to families in Kerala and empowered 45 lakh-plus women, including the poorest of the poor, by providing them with not just opportunities and finances, but also flexibility and proximity — allowing women to work at their convenient times, ensuring that their traditional role as the primary caregiver at home is never compromised.Explaining how Kudumbashree was born, noted economist MA Oommen , who did a seminal study on the role of the Kudumbashree movement in uplifting the social status of women in Kerala in 2007, said: “Under the central govt initiative of urban basic services, women formed self-help groups in Alappuzha. The idea of a microcredit enterprise grew out of this initiative. It was soon extended to Malappuram by the Kerala govt, and it indeed captured the potential for women empowerment. In the late 1990s, when Kudumbashree was launched as a women empowerment and poverty alleviation programme in Kerala, it was a great event with no parallel anywhere else in India.”Initiated by the State Poverty Eradication Mission (SPEM) of Kerala, Kudumbashree’s goal was to ensure community-based poverty eradication and women empowerment at the grassroots level by establishing micro-enterprises, principally led by women and ensuring they have adequate skill acquisition, financial autonomy and social mobility.Built around three vital components — microcredit, entrepreneurship, and empowerment — with the aim of improving the standard of living of poor women, ini tially Kudumbashree combined different kinds of activities such as generating savings, providing loans to members for the purchase of assets, providing education, helping with the construction of homes, and setting up of small scale industries.In later years, assistance was also provided with various income-generating activities such as chit funds, Onam fund, leasing arable land for paddy cultivation to the landless women members of Kudumbashree, roping them in for the ‘Clean Kerala business’, ensuring solid waste management, running ‘Janakeeya Hotels’ as part of the ‘Hunger-Free Kerala’ campaign. Along with organising self-employment programmes, members were also trained in farming, rearing goats, rabbits or quails.“The programme gives an opportunity to every woman to tap into their potential and earn a living out of it. This has saved many families from financial distress, pulling them out of poverty,” said Rathnavalli C from Malappuram district, who makes soft toys, stuffed dolls and artificial flowers and sells them at multiple Kudumbashree outlets, at airports in Kerala and also on online platforms.What made the programme different was that all these development initiatives were designed and implemented by women. Having ensured financial independence, members are now encouraged to actively participate in politics. Not only have Kudumbashree members voted in local self-govt elections, but many of them have even been candidates in these polls. “That nearly 17,000 Kudumbashree members fought elections and 7,071 have won is a great achievement in itself and an empowerment indicator compared to the rest of India,” Oommen said.“We’ve never stuck to any one initiative and have continuously evolved, even adopting artificial intelligence,” said Rajeena TM , the district mission coordinator from Ernakulam.With an eye on roping in the younger generation, several auxiliary groups have been formed. This was done after it came to light that members between 18 and 40 years of age constituted only 10% of the Kudumbashree workforce. Moreover, to ensure greater gender inclusivity, Kudumbashree has started special neighbourhood groups for transgenders to allow them an opportunity to earn a decent livelihood and lead a dignified life in society.“It is still at a nascent stage. We are now trying to attract qualified women who have taken a career break into the group,” said Jyothi S, who is pursuing her MBA and is herself an auxiliary group member.She said she was attracted to the group because of her mother who is an active Kudumbashree member in Ernakulam. For auxiliary group members, Kudumbashree has introduced spoken English classes, developed a website for job-seekers, especially those who have taken a career break.For women with an entrepreneurial zeal, there are also funding options, just like the one available for Kudumbashree members.Inspired by the way Kudumbashree is helping women, now several states in India and countries such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi , and Liberia are trying to emulate this model. Kudumbashree is providing training to interested parties by providing valuable inputs on best practices, case studies and in-depth discussions on issues identified by the partner countries, with an eye on customistion.","Kudumbashree Mission is one of the world’s largest networks of women-run initiatives helmed by the govt of Kerala. It has empowered 45 lakh-plus women, including the poorest of the poor, by providing them with not just opportunities and finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113889933,imgsize-1232100,width-400,resizemode-4/113889933.jpg"
"After a bumper harvest in iPhone production, Apple set to make AirPods in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-a-bumper-harvest-in-iphone-production-apple-set-to-make-airpods-in-india/articleshow/113886905.cms,"NEW DELHI: After shifting iPhone production worth billions of dollars to India, Apple is set to step up the game in the country, having finalised plans to start producing AirPods , with a massive focus on exports.The company will start making the casing for the product at the Pune factory of American contract manufacturer Jabil, and thereafter the AirPods will be manufactured at a new unit of Foxconn in Telangana, sources told TOI.“It will be a mega operation, on the lines of the work done for iPhones, and will be focused mainly on global exports, considering that the market for AirPods is much bigger abroad than in India,” the sources said.A questionnaire sent to Apple as well as Foxconn was not answered.The AirPods production comes to India even in the absence of a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for hearables, something which is there for those making smartphones.Apple, which began manufacturing iPhones in India in 2021, is estimated to have exported around $14 billion of its smartphone production in FY24. This constituted 14% of the iPhone’s global production.The company is ramping up the iPhone production rapidly and has also started manufacturing the coveted Pro series of models from this year through its list of contract manufacturers -- Taiwanese Foxconn and Pegatron, and the local Tata group (who had taken over the operations of Wistron).The AirPods will be manufactured from next year, and will also be sold in India, the sources said, adding that Apple plans to ramp up the production “to a few billion dollars very rapidly.”“The focus on exports means that Apple will create a second large manufacturing base outside China, which currently is one of the key production centres for most of its products. The plan was the same when the iPhone manufacturing had started,” one of the sources said.The govt is enthused about the plans of the company to deepen its manufacturing in the country, especially as its products are in the premium category and add a lot of weight to the country’s export basket when shipped abroad.For Apple, India is gradually developing as a trusted manufacturing base, especially as many of its key vendors set up base here with the production volumes getting bigger. While state governments have pitched in with incentives for bagging the factories being set for the company’s products, the central govt has also been playing the role of a facilitator by showing leniency towards the entry of many of its Chinese parts vendors (notwithstanding the otherwise stiff positioning around investments from the neighbouring country due to border and diplomatic tensions).And as Apple prepares to add the AirPods to its India manufacturing, the company does not have any immediate plans to make the MacBooks in the country. This is despite the fact that the govt has been pushing laptop makers to Make in India, with an attractive production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.“The MacBooks will take time when it comes to local manufacturing in India . First, the volumes for Apple’s premium notebooks are still limited here, and so the business case is also restricted. Also, with more than sufficient global production levels, creating new factories in India can lead to oversupply. Thus, MacBook production will take time as of now,” one of the sources said.","The company will start making the casing for the product at the Pune factory of American contract manufacturer Jabil.

MEERUT: Malkhan Singh , an IAF soldier, was 23 when an Antonov-12 aircraft, carrying 102 people, including him, went missing on Feb 7, 1968. It was later found crashed over Himachal 's Rohtang Pass On Tuesday, when two Army officials came to Malkhan's old house in Fatehpur village in UP's Saharanpur district, informing the family about the recovery of his mortal remains - his wife died waiting for him for 32 years - there was silence at first.And then joy. And tears. It was overwhelming for everyone. The family was told to make arrangements for the last rites.He was too young for us to believe he was indeed dead. His wife spent her life thinking he was alive somewhere and would return one day. She had a newly born son when he went missing. She died sometime around 2000, carrying a lifelong hope and wait,” said Malkhan’s youngest brother, Isham Pal, now 65.“If the body had been found even 25 years ago, his wife would have rested in peace,” added cousin Vishwas Singh. The family said that ever since Malkhan disappeared, they never heard anything about him.“We lost all hope after running pillar to post searching for him,” Vishwas said. “When he couldn’t be traced for years, there was a ‘family adjustment’. Malkhan’s wife was married off to his brother Chandrapal Singh. Malkhan’s only son, Ram Prasad, had two sons, Gautam Kumar (22) and Manish Singh (16), and three daughters. Ram Prasad died in 2010. Malkhan’s parents, wife and only son passed away desperately waiting for closure.”Malkhan’s grandchildren, who grew up listening to stories about him, took part in his last journey on Wednesday as hundreds, perhaps more, joined in. “We are full of emotions,” said Gautam. The mortal remains reached Fatehpur in the afternoon, amid the huge crowd of mourners, and he was cremated later in the evening. Malkhan Singh had finally come home.","Malkhan Singh, an IAF soldier, was 23 when an Antonov-12 aircraft, carrying 102 people, including him, went missing on Feb 7, 1968.

Hathras stampede: No mention of Bhole Baba in chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hathras-stampede-no-mention-of-bhole-baba-in-chargesheet/articleshow/113886518.cms,"SIT report also didn’t question Baba’s role in Hathras tragedy

AGRA: Police have submitted a 3,200-page chargesheet on the Hathras stampede which claimed 121 lives on July 2 and took place during a congregation organised by self-styled 'godman' Surajpal Singh alias Bhole Baba. The chargesheet names 11 accused, including two women, but does not mention Bhole Baba as an accused in the case.Defence lawyer AP Singh, representing the accused, said, ""The trial will commence once the court takes cognisance of the chargesheet.The next hearing is scheduled for Oct 4.""On Tuesday, 10 accused, including the main organiser and fundraiser of the event, Dev Prakash Madhukar, were brought from Aligarh district jail to Hathras district court as part of the legal process .An FIR was lodged in the matter on July 2 under BNS sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 110 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 126(2) (wrongful restraint), 223 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by the public servant) and 238 (causing disappearance of evidence).Allahabad high court had in Sept granted conditional interim bail to the two accused women - Manju Devi and Manju Yadav - while the remaining nine accused continued to be in custody.Earlier, a special investigation team (SIT) had submitted a report on the deaths, leading to the suspension of six officials, including deputy superintendent of police (circle officer) of Sikandra Rao, Anand Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate Ravindra Kumar, tehsildar Sushil Kumar and two sub-inspectors - Manveer Singh and Brijesh Pandey - for ""negligence and dereliction of duty"". Interestingly, the SIT report did not raise any questions about the role of Bhole Baba.Govt agencies, including police, have attributed the tragedy to ""mismanagement"" by the organisers, highlighting that the crowd numbers exceeded 2.5 lakh, surpassing the permitted 80,000. Bhole Baba's lawyer also claimed that the stampede was triggered by ""some poisonous substance"" sprayed by ""some unidentified men"".On July 3, UP govt had formed a three-member judicial commission, headed by retired Allahabad high court judge Brijesh Kumar Srivastav, to investigate the case and explore the possibility of a ""conspiracy"" behind the stampede. The commission is yet to conclude its probe.","Police have submitted a 3,200-page chargesheet on the Hathras stampede which claimed 121 lives on July 2.

Bombay High Court: Bombay High Court Seeks Attorney General's Response on Sachin Waze's Bail Plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-issues-notice-to-attorney-general-of-india-on-sachin-wazes-release/articleshow/113886331.cms,"Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Attorney General on a petition filed by dismissed police officer Sachin Waze , who has filed a plea for his release on bail from jail and questioned the validity of certain legal provisions preventing it.""Since the constitutional validity of Section 306 (4)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code is challenged, we issue notice to the Attorney General,"" said the HC division bench of Justices MS Sonak and Kamal Khata.The section provides that an accused granted pardon as an approver in a criminal case shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in custody until the termination of the trial.Waze had filed a hand-written petition from Taloja Prison, where he is lodged as an undertrial accused in the planting of explosives near Antilia and for the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiran. He is also accused of extorting money from hotel and bar establishments in Mumbai. His lawyer, Rounaik Naik, arguing before the bench on Oct 1, said he is challenging the very validity of the law on the grounds that it violates a citizen's fundamental right to liberty and equality. Naik said Waze is an approver in the restaurant and bars' extortion case.The HC posted the matter on Oct 11 when it will consider Waze's plea for interim bail . The HC also directed the State public prosecutor to submit a synopsis of arguments and a compilation of judgments that he may seek to rely on.Waze, dismissed from service, is facing terror charges under the stringent anti-terror law—Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. On February 25, 2021, an explosives-laden SUV was found near ‘Antilia' in south Mumbai. Hiran, who said he was in possession of the SUV before it was allegedly stolen, was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on March 5, 2021.Waze is the main accused in the case along with a few more police officials and others, including a bookie, Naresh Gaur, accused of allegedly getting SIM cards illegally. Waze's case was that there is no material to even remotely indicate how, from whom, and where he had procured gelatine sticks or had placed the gelatine sticks sans detonators in the four-wheeler outside. He said the Bombay High Court has observed that there is a shoddy investigation in this regard.","Waze had filed a hand-written petition from Taloja Prison, where he is lodged as an undertrial accused in the planting of explosives near Antilia and for the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiran.

Iran Launches Missile Attack On Israel, Causing Panic In Jerusalem | Watch

NEW DELHI: With Iran launching missile attacks on Israel late Tuesday night (India time) and the conflict set to worsen, airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety. Lufthansa ’s Tuesday flights from Frankfurt to Hyderabad and Mumbai returned to Germany as the airline decided not to venture in the war zone for safety reasons. Lufthansa’s Frankfurt-Hyderabad LH 752 and Frankfurt-Mumbai LH 756 were over Turkey when Iran launched missile attack on Israel.The aircraft turned back to Frankfurt. Consequently the return flights on these two sectors (India-Germany that these planes would have operated) early Wednesday have been cancelled.SWISS is avoiding the airspace over Iran, Iraq and Jordan. “This will increase flight times by up to 15 minutes on our Dubai, India and Southeast Asia services. Regardless of this short-term adjustment, Israeli and Lebanese airspace will be bypassed up to and including Oct 31,” SWISS said in a statement. Tuesday’s Zurich-Dubai flight diverted to Antalya in Turkey due to the longer route required to be taken. The aircraft will refuel in Antalya and continue its journey to Dubai outside the affected airspace.A Lufthansa spokesperson said, “Due to the current security situation, we are no longer flying through the airspace’s of Iraq, Iran and Jordan.” Tuesday’s Munich-Mumbai was able to operate.An Air India official said: “All our flights are assessed daily for any potential security or safety risks whether it is in the Middle East or any other part of our route network. Adjustments are made, if required, to avoid areas of risk with minimal impact on our non-stop operations.”Opsgroup — a global membership organisation for people in flight operations like pilots, flight dispatchers, schedulers, and air traffic controllers — had on Aug 1 released a “special briefing” on due to the increasing tension in the region. It said in the event of an “aerial attack” in the region, short notice closures of airspaces in Iran, Iraq and Jordan “are very likely.” It had advised members that “ongoing GPS spoofing, which can impact a multitude of aircraft systems, is predominant in two areas: Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.”This April also when the region as very tense, “GPS jamming and spoofing levels surged in the Middle East, with major blackout/interference spots apparent in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, as well as Israel. Traffic routing via Egypt and Saudi on a Middle East transit (Southern Route) should expect spoofing and be alert for early signs of that,” Opsgroup had said.Several pilots operating to the west say GPS spoofing and jamming is worsening by the day. “The moment we cross Iran-Pakistan border, jamming and spoofing start. This continues right till we clear Turkey in the west. The Russian airspace also has this issue, especially closer to the troubled regions,” say pilots.“We inform enroute ATCs about this and ask them to monitor aircraft position on radar. We are using the alternate DME-DME update that uses the plane’s last location to keep track of its location,” say multiple senior pilots. Airline crew are trained to deal with GPS jamming and spoofing. With multiple war zones and security theatres, this is becoming a real issue especially while crossing international borders and conflict zones as a bid to confuse crew. Airlines exchange notes on this issue in a real time basis.","Airlines that used to overfly the region are scurrying for safety.

Earth gets a ‘mini moon’ for 2 months and it has a Mahabharata connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/earth-gets-a-mini-moon-for-2-months-and-it-has-a-mahabharata-connection/articleshow/113791435.cms,"An illustration for visual representation of asteroid trajectory

This ‘mini-moon’ is actually an asteroid — named ‘2024 PT5’ — which is about the size of a school bus. When it whizzed past Earth on Sunday (Sept 29), it would be temporarily pulled by our planet’s gravity. However, the Earth’s double delight of possessing two ‘Moons’ will be short-lived as the asteroid will revolve around the Earth only for 57 days.The asteroid will jettison the Earth’s gravity and disappear into deep space by late November.The ‘2024 PT 5’ was discovered on August 7, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), an automated system funded by the US space agency Nasa and run from Hawaii. The system is used to monitor near-Earth asteroids.In a report published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS), astronomers say the orbital properties of 2024 PT5 resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt, ‘a sparsely resonant population of small Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).’Dr Anil Kumar, head of Isro's Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA), which is also keeping a close watch on the asteroid, has also confirmed that the ‘ mini moon ’ is part of the Arjuna Asteroid grouping. The grouping was named in honour of Arjuna, a central character in epic Mahabharata, who was known for his archery skills and bravery. Like the swift arrows of Arjuna, the name reflects both the asteroid’s swift movement through the solar system and its unpredictable nature.The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km, making it too small to detect without specialised equipment.Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos, two scientists who reported it, said, “NEOs that follow horseshoe paths, and approach our planet at close range and low relative velocity, may undergo mini-moon events in which their geocentric energy becomes negative for hours, days or months, but without completing one revolution around Earth"".Marcos said this is not the first time mini Moons appear around the Earth. It happened in 1997, 2013 and 2018, a report said.On Nov 25, asteroid ‘2024 PT5’ will part ways with the Earth and continue its solo trajectory in cosmos. It's expected to pass by Earth again in 2055.","The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km.

Strengthened relations with neighbors

(With inputs from agencies)

External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday strongly defended India’s right to respond to US political leaders’ comments about Indian democracy during an address at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. In a pointed message, he said the US should not ""feel bad"" if India comments on their internal affairs in response.In a candid response to questions regarding US political figures' remarks on India's democracy, Jaishankar explained that the globalised nature of the world has blurred the lines between domestic and international politics.He emphasised that while democracies can discuss global issues, mutual respect must be maintained.""It cannot be that one democracy has a right to comment on another and that’s part of promoting democracy globally, but when others do that, then it becomes foreign interference,"" Jaishankar asserted. He clarified that foreign interference is unacceptable, regardless of the country behind it, remarking, ""Foreign interference is foreign interference, irrespective of who does it and where it is done.""Jaishankar’s remarks came in the context of increasing US commentary on democratic developments in India. He acknowledged that the US has long shaped international politics through its foreign policy and that in today’s interconnected world, political narratives are shaped globally, not just domestically.""The United States makes a special effort to ensure [its politics] doesn’t stay within its national boundaries. That is a part of how the US has conducted its foreign policy over the years,"" he observed. He also stressed that India reserves the right to comment on these matters, noting, ""You have every right to comment, but I have every right to comment on your comment. So don't feel bad when I do.""Jaishankar also addressed India’s evolving relationships with its neighboring countries, highlighting that these ties have grown significantly stronger since independence. He pointed to increased cooperation in infrastructure, trade, and energy, noting that ""our relationship with our neighbors would be much stronger than it has been since independence.""The EAM underscored India's efforts to foster regional integration, citing improvements in power grids, fuel flows, rail lines, and airways. He said that the flow of people and goods across borders had drastically increased, further enhancing India’s regional influence. ""Every year, we issue about 1.5-1.6 million visas to Bangladesh alone, and we have much more trade and economic activity than ever before,"" Jaishankar said.However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by political changes in the region, especially in countries like Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Recent political shifts, including Mohamed Muizzu's rise to power in the Maldives and leadership changes in Nepal and Sri Lanka, have presented new diplomatic challenges for India.","S Jaishankar said the US should not ""feel bad"" if India comments on their internal affairs in response.

Will Prashant Kishor's pitch against liquor ban in Bihar be a gamechanger for his Jan Suraaj Party?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-prashant-kishors-pitch-against-liquor-ban-in-bihar-be-a-gamechanger-for-his-jan-suraaj-party/articleshow/113882194.cms,"NEW DELHI: Political strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor has dared to tread an uncharted territory in Bihar politics in recent times with his promise of scrapping liquor ban in the state, within an hour, if voted to power by the people in assembly elections due next year.Interestingly, liquor ban is considered to be one of the important factors behind the continued electoral success of Nitish Kumar, who is now the longest serving chief minister of Bihar.Many analysts believe liquor ban helped increase Nitish Kumar 's popularity among women, espcecially in the rural areas. Little wonder, none of the mainstream parties have spoken openly against it, perhaps for the fear of losing women voters. There have been some individual voices against the law, but none of the parties has opposed it openly.Liquor ban was implemented in Bihar in 2016 to deal with the problem of alcoholism and problems related to it in the state. It was also Nitish Kumar’s election promise to the women of the state who suffered due to excessive drinking of their male members and as such it helped consolidate women voters in favour of ruling JD(U).However, implementing the liquor prohibition law has been a huge challenge for the Nitish government. Despite the ban, Bihar has reported several official deaths caused by consuming of illicit alcohol and also hooch tragedies. The conviction rate has also been very poor. Moreover, the stringent provisions of the law has led to widespread resentment in the state among a large population, which perhaps Prashant Kishor hopes to capitalise.Prashant Kishor claims prohibition law is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore to Bihar. He plans to plug this loss after scrapping the law and use the money to provide world-class education system to the children and youth of the state.""We will need more than Rs 4 lakh crore to improve education in the state. We will raise the money by scrapping the prohibition law which is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore. I reiterate that once Jan Suraaj comes to power, the ban on liquor will be scrapped within one hour,"" said the 47-year-old leader during the launch of hisJan Suraaj Party .""When the liquor ban will be removed, that money won't go into the budget and will not be used for the security of leaders, nor it will be used for roads, water and electricity. That will be used only for building a new education system in Bihar,"" he added.""Jan Suraaj's top priority will be on quality education for children,"" he said and urged people to think about their children's future. ""How many times have you voted for the education and employment of your children? Education quality and employment were never prioritised in Bihar because you never voted for these things,"" Kishor said.But the big question is - Will Prashant Kishor's emphasis on improving education have takers in a state where caste and religion have played a big role in politics? Are people in Bihar ready to say yes to liquor? Will it be a gamechanger for his Jan Suraaj Party? We do not know the answers to all these questions now. But what we do know is that Prashant Kishor's ""scrap liquor ban"" agenda will surely trigger a much-needed debate on the effectiveness of the prohibition law.The mainstream parties have played down Prashant Kishor's entry into politics with the RJD calling Jan Suraaj Party a B-team of the BJP and the saffron party taking potshots at him and claiming at least two parties get registered in Bihar before polls every time. However, it is the people of Bihar who would next year decide the fate of Jan Suraaj Party and its scrap liquor ban agenda.","Prashant Kishor claims prohibition law is annually causing losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore to Bihar.

"This winter may be harsh in North India due to La Nina conditions, indicates IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-winter-may-be-harsh-in-north-india-due-to-la-nina-conditions-predicts-imd/articleshow/113863095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Summer monsoon, which ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall, is likely to fully withdraw from the country by mid-October and the winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula, the IMD said on Tuesday. It also hinted at the possibility of a harsh winter in north India, specially northwest India, including Delhi-NCR and adjoining central region, as La Nina conditions are expected to form during Oct-Nov.La Nina is a climate phenomena associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Though it is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent, it remained absent during the southwest (summer) monsoon months despite forecasts by different global models.""There is a 71% chance that La Nina conditions will develop during Oct-Nov... The years when you have La Nina, temperatures in the northern part of the country, specially northwest India and adjoining central region, are below normal (colder than normal)... So, you can have cold wave conditions during winter months,"" said IMD chief, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.He, however, underlined that its severity would be known only later as the La Nina condition is still weak and the Met department will have to monitor how much it will be strengthened in January or February. The IMD will follow it up and will be able to come out with a more precise forecast only in November.Good rainfall this year, however, was mainly due to other factors including six depressions, 14 'low pressure systems' in Bay of Bengal and one cyclonic storm 'Asna' in the Arabian Sea.Overall the ‘above normal’ rainfall during the season not only helped increase the acreage of the kharif (summer sown) crops beyond ‘normal’ (average of last five years) sown area, bringing hope of good crop output, but also filled reservoirs that take care of irrigation needs of rabi (winter sown) crops and hydro-power generation.Region-wise performance of the summer monsoon that technically ended on Monday showed a very unique feature of regional variation in rainfall this year with arid west Rajasthan receiving excess rainfall to the extent of 71% more showers than what it normally gets. Similarly, west Gujarat too received 75% more than its normal rainfall during the season.Mohapatra attributed ‘large excess’ rainfall in west Rajasthan and west Gujarat to formation of more numbers of ‘low pressure systems’ and ‘depressions’ that this year extended as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. He also noted how the monsoon trough remained south of its normal position, bringing ‘large excess’ rains in both these meteorological subdivisions, covering 9% of the total area of the country.Out of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country, two subdivisions received large excess rainfall, 10 subdivisions constituting 26% of the total area received excess, 21 subdivisions received normal rainfall (54% of the total area) and three subdivisions (Arunachal Pradesh, Punjab, J & K and Ladak) constituting 11% of the total area received deficient season rainfall.Data shows that Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh each received 28% less than normal rainfall whereas J&K and Ladakh got 26% deficit rainfall.",Summer monsoon ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall. The winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula.

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , a former political strategist turned activist, officially launched his political party, Jan Suraaj Party , on Wednesday at an event held at Veterinary College Ground in Bihar 's Patna.The launch was attended by several prominent figures, including former Union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav, diplomat-turned-politician Pavan Varma, and ex-MP Monazir Hassan.""Jan Suraaj campaign is going on for 2-3 years. People are asking when we will be forming the party. We all must thank God, today, the Election Commission has officially accepted Jan Suraaj as Jan Suraaj Party,"" Kishor said during the event.During his speech, Kishor emphasised the need for a world-class education system in Bihar, saying that Rs 5 lakh crore would be required over the next decade to achieve this goal.He also criticised the state's liquor ban , claiming that it results in an annual loss of Rs 20,000 crore, which could be utilised for improving education, infrastructure, and other essential services.""If Bihar has to have a world-class education system, Rs 5 lakh crore is needed in the next 10 years. When the liquor ban will be removed, that money won't go into the budget and will not be used for the security of leaders, nor it will be used for roads, water and electricity. That will be used only for building a new education system in Bihar. Every year, Bihar is facing a loss of Rs 20,000 crore due to the liquor ban,"" he added.The launch of Jan Suraaj Party comes two years after Kishor's 3,000-km-long 'padayatra' across Bihar, which aimed to mobilise people for a new political alternative to address the state's chronic backwardness.Later, Kishor also named Manoj Bharti the working president of the Jan Suraaj Party. Bharti, who hails from Madhubani, pursued his education at Netarhat in Jharkhand before enrolling at IIT Kanpur. He later completed his M Tech degree from IIT Delhi. Bharti has had a distinguished career in the foreign service, representing India as an ambassador to several countries.During his diplomatic tenure, he served as India's ambassador to Ukraine, Belarus, Timor-Leste, and Indonesia.Prior to the party's launch, Kishor called upon the people to raise the 'Jai Bihar' slogan loudly enough to be heard in Delhi, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu, where children from Bihar have been subjected to abuse and violence. He emphasised the need for Biharis to assert their identity and demand respect from the rest of the country.""You all need to say 'Jai Bihar' so loud that no one calls you and your children 'Bihari' and it feels like abuse. Your voice must reach Delhi. It must reach Bengal, where students from Bihar were beaten. It must reach Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Bombay wherever Bihari children were abused and beaten,"" Prashant Kishor had said.","Former political strategist Prashant Kishor officially launched his political party, Jan Suraaj Party, on Wednesday.

Iran-Israel war: How big is Iran’s missile power and what is Israel’s defence system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-israel-war-how-big-is-irans-missile-power-and-what-is-israels-defence-system/articleshow/113881116.cms,"Photo/Agencies

How dangerous is Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal

Israel's defence mechanism: Beyond the Iron Dome

The Middle East edged nearer to a wider regional conflict following Iran 's launch of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, sending almost 10 million people into bomb shelters as projectiles and interceptors exploded in the skies above.Israel said it has initiated restricted ground operations in Lebanon, focusing on the Iran-supported Hezbollah militia.According to Israeli sources, many of the missiles were intercepted, and US officials said that American destroyers contributed to Israel's defense.Iran claimed that the majority of its missiles reached their intended targets. No immediate reports of casualties were available.The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel. Ballistic missiles are an important part of the arsenal at Tehran's disposal.To better understand the situation, it is crucial to examine Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and the defensive capabilities of Israeli forces:Iran possesses a significantly larger arsenal of artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) compared to Israel. However, these weapon systems would need to be deployed near Israel's borders to be effective, as traditional artillery and MLRS with a range of 70-80 km cannot reach Israel from their current positions.Iran is also known to have a substantial number of short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel. According to a 2021 report by the Missile Threat Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Tehran has thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles with a variety of ranges.Ballistic missiles follow a trajectory that takes them outside or near the limits of Earth's atmosphere before the warhead separates from the rocket and descends onto its target. An analysis of Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal, considering guidance systems and range, reveals a significant threat to Israel, as Iran is believed to possess at least five different long-range ballistic missiles that can reach Israel from Iranian territory.Iran's Ballistic missile system includes primarily short-range and medium-range missiles, such as the Fateh, Sajjil, Shahab, Qiam, and Khorramshar. The short-range Shahab-2, with a range of up to 500 km, has been part of Iran's arsenal since 1998, while the Fateh-313, another short-range missile with a similar range, was incorporated into Iran's defense system in 2015.Medium-range missiles, capable of traveling 1,000 to 2,000 km, were introduced into Iran's defense program in 2003 with the Shahab-3. These missiles use liquid propellant, carry warheads weighing 760 to 1,200 kg, and can be launched from mobile launchers and silos. According to Iran Watch, the latest variants of the Shahab-3, the Ghadr and Emad missiles, have accuracies within 300 meters (almost 1,000 feet) of their intended targets.Iranian media reported that Tehran used a new missile, the Fateh-1, in Tuesday's attacks on Israel. This 'hypersonic' missile travels at Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound (6,100 km per hour).Israel's nuclear capabilities have been a topic of speculation for decades, as the nation maintains a policy of ambiguity regarding its nuclear arsenal. While the country has not officially confirmed or denied possessing nuclear weapons, it is widely assumed that Israel has a substantial nuclear stockpile.According to estimates from the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, Israel's nuclear arsenal likely consists of approximately 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads. Furthermore, the country is believed to have produced sufficient plutonium to potentially manufacture between 100 and 200 nuclear weapons.Israel has a multi-layered missile defense system designed to intercept various types of threats, from ballistic missiles that reach high altitudes to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.The Iron Dome, which has garnered significant attention for its effectiveness, is the lowest tier of Israel's missile defense and is primarily used to counter incoming rockets and artillery weapons. However, the Iron Dome was not the system employed to combat the ballistic missiles launched on Tuesday night, CNN reported.The next level of defense is David's Sling, a collaborative effort between Israel's RAFAEL Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon. This system protects against short- and medium-range threats, utilizing Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to neutralize targets up to 186 miles away, as reported by the Missile Threat Project at the CSIS.Above David's Sling, Israel has the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, both developed in partnership with the United States. The Arrow 2 employs fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, as they descend towards their targets in the upper atmosphere.According to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, representing an upgrade from the US Patriot missile defenses Israel previously used in this role.The Arrow 3, on the other hand, utilizes hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.",Iran claims that the majority of its missiles reached their intended targets. The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel. Iran has a significantly larger arsenal of artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) compared to Israel.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113882984,imgsize-923977,width-400,resizemode-4/113882984.jpg"

'Workers holding employers' cash as fiduciaries are not benamidars',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/workers-holding-employers-cash-as-fiduciaries-are-not-benamidars/articleshow/113885884.cms,"MUMBAI: The appellate tribunal which adjudicates benami matters has held that employees can hold cash in a fiduciary capacity for their employers, without it being classified as a benami transaction. This order can support both employers and employees who face a similar situation.""Fiduciary relationships involve trust and confidence, often between employer and employee, where the employee is acting in the interest of the employer.In several business setups employees do hold cash in a fiduciary capacity,"" explained Ashwani Taneja, one of the advocates who represented the employees.Cash held by employees in a fiduciary capacity, falls under the exception to the definition of a 'benami' transaction under Section 2(9)(A)(ii) of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act , 1988. However, it is essential that the relationship of trust and safekeeping is well established, and there is no conflict of interest or intention of personal gain. Taneja said that while this tribunal order is not binding, it will have a persuasive impact and can be referenced in similar cases.In this case of Jiten Pujari and others, following a search conducted under the Income-tax (I-T) Act, a sum of nearly Rs 10 crore was found in several bank lockers of the employees. The employees did not claim ownership of the cash and stated that it belonged to their employers. In turn, the employers also did not disown the ownership of the cash. In addition, the sum was added to the income of the employers and taxed in their hands.Based on the facts, the tribunal noted that the employees were holding the cash for safekeeping, which falls under fiduciary duty, rather than being part of a benami transaction. On the other hand, if a transaction is treated as a benami transaction, the assets are confiscated by govt, the parties involved face imprisonment for up to 7 years and stiff penalties.","Employees can hold cash in a fiduciary capacity for their employers, without it being classified as a benami transaction.

TOI had reported on Tuesday that Jaishankar will visit Sri Lanka on October 4.Jaishankar’s visit for a meeting with the new president, barely a couple of weeks into Dissanayake’s presidency, is meant to build on the Indian outreach to the relatively unfamiliar leader ahead of the presidential poll that saw him visiting India earlier this year. The Indian government is also banking on the goodwill generated by its $ 4 billion-worth assistance to the strategically crucial Indian Ocean nation - in the middle of an acute financial crisis - to ride out any negative fallout from the winds of political change blowing in the country.Jha also met the new Lankan PM, Harini Amarasuriya, on Wednesday. According to Dissanayake, the high commissioner reflected on the long-standing friendship and closeness between the two nations, highlighting the importance of maintaining a continuous and stable partnership as neighbouring states.Furthermore, the president added, Jha pointed out the significance of digitizing government systems to effectively combat corruption. ``He appreciated the anti-corruption program outlined in our policy statement, and he expressed India’s willingness to assist Sri Lanka in implementing these digitization initiatives,’’ said Dissanayake.Dissanayake’s anti-corruption focus in the election campaign found a lot of traction among young voters, who were upset with the mishandling of Sri Lanka’s financial crisis and also with discredited political dynasties who for long held the reins of power. India believes Dissanayake’s emphasis on rooting out corruption in the handling of infrastructure projects will work in its favour as it believes in transparent infrastructure development backed by responsible debt financing practices.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met Indian high commissioner Santosh Jha.

Veteran Tollywood actor and Chaitanya's father, Akkineni Nagarjuna, too condemned the minister's comments which he said were all false.""As a woman in a responsible position, your comments and accusations against our family are completely irrelevant and false,"" Nagarjuna wrote on his official 'X' handle, urging the minister to withdraw her comments immediately.""I strongly condemn the comments of the minister...Don't use the lives of movie stars who stay away from politics to criticise your opponents. Please respect other people's privacy...I am condemning the statement in the strongest possible terms,"" Nagarjuna wrote. His wife, Amala Akkineni, also lashed out at Konda Surekha for ""conjuring evil fiction allegations, preying on decent citizens as fuel for a political war"".""This is really shameful. If leaders lower themselves into the gutter and behave like criminals, what will happen to our country?"" she added.",Konda Surekha blamed BRS working president KT Rama Rao for the divorce of Tollywood actors Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Prabhu. Her comments drew sharp reactions from the film industry and turned into a full-blown political row within hours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113885789,imgsize-1032537,width-400,resizemode-4/113885789.jpg"
"Intern not hospital employee, says consumer commission, junks medical negligence claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intern-not-hospital-employee-says-consumer-commission-junks-medical-negligence-claim/articleshow/113885754.cms,"MUMBAI: Observing that a medical intern is not a hospital's employee, the national consumer commission rejected a Mira Road father's claim of Rs one crore, alleging that his 24-year-old doctor son died at his Amravati medical college and hospital due to medical negligence . ""An intern cannot be equated with the regular employee. As per Black's Law Dictionary, an intern is an advanced student or recent graduate who is apprenticing to gain practical experience before entering a specific profession."" As the complaint has failed to prove that any consideration was paid to the opposite parties, the complaint cannot be treated as a 'consumer',"" the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said last month.Amarjeet B Mishra had moved the national consumer commission in 2022 after the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dismissed his plea and also imposed costs of Rs 50,000.The father submitted that his son, Vijay Mishra , completed his MBBS from Dr Panjabrao Alias Bhausaheb Deshmukh Memorial Medical College in 2015. After completing the MBBS course, he started serving in the medical college as an intern. On March 24, 2015, following a call, Amarjeet rushed to Amravati where he was informed that his son had died earlier in the day. The father further submitted that more than 400 doctors, including the interns, were sitting on dharna in front of the hospital due to the death, which he said was caused by medical negligence. He said that he came to know that there were no life-saving and other medical equipment in the hospital, which resulted in the sudden death of his son.Following the Bombay high court's directions, the CID conducted investigations in the case. Referring to chats allegedly recovered, the father claimed that in addition to the lack of required facilities, there was foul play and his son was killed by some students over his proximity with one of the female students. He alleged that something was mixed in his drinks.The hospital denied the allegations. It was submitted that the father was intimated about the ill-health of his son on March 24, 2015, at 4.00am. It is denied that the intern and doctors were sitting on dharna due to deficiency in service on their part and non-availability of necessary equipment in the hospital. ""Dharna was a natural reaction of doctors and interns to the sudden death of their colleague.... The son of the complainant died due to a heart attack and the allegation of the complainant that his son died in mysterious circumstances is false. It is denied that the complainant... asked the doctors for a post-mortem of the deceased....,"" the hospital submitted.","Amarjeet B Mishra had moved the national consumer commission in 2022.

However, it was lower than the approximately 65.4% polling recorded in the 2014 assembly polls, excluding the four assembly seats that were then part of Ladakh, which is now a separate Union territory.The final turnout for Phase 3, based on EVM votes, was nearly 69.7%, showing only a slight rise over the figure put out by the Election Commission at 11.45 pm on Tuesday.Sources said this is due to a conscious effort by the EC to have district election officers update the voting turnout figures in its app, by the end of the polling day.
