Army chief

Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi:

Born on July 1, 1964, Sanjeev Kumar Dwivedi is a alumnus of Sainik School, Rewa. He began his military career on December 15, 1984, when he was commissioned into the 18 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles of the Indian Army.

During his long and distinguished service spanning nearly 40 years, he has served in a variety of command, staff, instructional and foreign appointments. The command appointments of Lt Gen Dwivedi include command of regiment (18 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles), Brigade (26 Sector Assam Rifles), Inspector General, Assam Rifles (East) and 9 Corps.

Lt Gen Dwivedi shares his alma mater with the newly appointed Navy chief, Admiral Dinesh Tripathi. Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, a graduate of the National Defence College and the US Army War College, has also completed training at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington and the Army War College in Mhow. In addition to his military education, the general holds an MPhil in defence and management studies. He has also earned two Masters' Degrees, one in Strategic Studies and another in Military Science.

With his extensive experience, particularly during his two-year stint as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GoC-in-C) of the Northern Command, Lt Gen Dwivedi possesses a deep understanding of the challenges posed by both China and Pakistan. Lt Gen Dwivedi, as the head of the Northern Command, was responsible for offering ""strategic guidance and operational oversight"" in the planning and execution of continuous operations along the northern and western borders shared with China and Pakistan. Furthermore, he supervised counter-terrorism efforts in the J&K region.

He has been decorated with the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal and three GOC-in-C Commendation Cards.

NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday announced that Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi will be the next chief of the Army Staff succeeding incumbent Gen Manoj Pande . Dwivedi is presently serving as the Vice Chief of the Army Staff. The tenure of the present Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj C Pande, ends on June 30.The government has followed the seniority principle in appointing Lt Gen Dwivedi, who was commissioned into the 18 Jammu & Kashmir Rifles in December 1984.Earlier on May 26, the government had made a surprising decision by extending Gen Pande's tenure by a month, a mere six days before his scheduled retirement. This unconventional action fueled rumors that a potential supersession within the military ranks was imminent. The move deviated from the typical protocol, where such decisions are usually made well in advance of an officer's retirement date.(With PTI inputs)",Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi will be the next chief of the Army Staff succeeding incumbent Gen Manoj Pande.

This comes after Sunday’s deadly ambush on a bus carrying pilgrims in Reasi district, where nine people were killed and 41 wounded.

Officials are silent on the civilians getting injured in Kathua, which is close to the Pakistan border. The attack occurred after locals sounded the alarm over “suspicious movement” in the area.

“One terrorist neutralised so far,” Singh posted.

The attack on Seda Sohal occurred after locals sounded the alarm over “suspicious movement” in the area, prompting the gunmen to attack and escape to nearby forests. “A manhunt was launched, resulting in the death of one terrorist,” an official said.

Panic spread through the area following the attack as it happened just two days after the pilgrim bus ambush in Reasi, which is close to LoC.

Earlier, on May 18 and 19, a search was prompted by reports of suspicious movement of three men in the area. Before that, villagers in Jathana of Kathua district had reported spotting six suspicious men, leading to a similar search operation on May 14, but no arrests were made.",Security forces killed a terrorist in a shootout late Tuesday evening after a group of three gunmen threw a grenade and fired gunshots at a house.

It however, turned down the plea to stay the counselling process.As the bench was convinced that the issue raised by 10 medical aspirants in their petition needed to be examined, it passed the order and decided to bring NEET 2024 under its scanner after a very brief hearing where their lawyer Mathews J Nedumpara did not have to make an effort to convince the court. The court directed NTA to respond to the allegations and posted the hearing for July 8, the first day after summer recess. It asked the agency to file a response and hinted that it may stay counselling in case of a delay in filing its reply.As Nedumpara pressed for stay on the counselling process for admission in medical colleges, the bench declined the plea.Around 24 lakh students took the examination conducted by NTA on May 5. The entrance test was conducted across 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 cities abroad. But reports of paper leak surfaced after the test and few arrests were also made. Controversy also cropped up on the way in which grace marks were ""arbitrarily"" given to a few students.Seeking quashing of exams due to paper leak, the petitioners said that four individuals, including two MBBS students, had been arrested for allegedly running a paper solver gang for NEET exam but the NTA was refuting the allegation of paper leak.""NTA has published its own circular/notification giving a clean chit to the alleged offenders in the paper leak case before the ongoing investigations of various agencies concerned is concluded in the backdrop of FIR registered by Shastri Nagar Police Station in Patna and investigation being further carried out by EOU Bihar Police,"" the petition said, pleading the court to intervene.Raising the issue of grant of grace marks, advocate J Sai Deepak told the court that a fresh petition has been filed and the court should also examine the controversy along with allegation of paper leak but the bench said that it was for SC registry to take a call on listing of the case.The petitioners alleged arbitrariness in the grant of grace marks and contended that high marks of 718 & 719 out of 720 secured by several students were ""statistically impossible"".It said that the grant of grace marks due to delay during the exam, was a mala fide exercise to give ""backdoor entry"" to certain students and questioned how 67 students from one particular centre got full 720 marks.",Supreme Court on Tuesday sought explanation from National Testing Agency ( NTA ) on alleged irregularities in conducting the test.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan faces a critical juncture in the T20 World Cup , reeling from losses against the USA and India. Their upcoming clash with Canada holds immense significance, as a win is imperative for their Super Eight qualification hopes.With a Super Over defeat against the USA and a six-run loss to India, Pakistan's campaign has been marred by inconsistency and a lack of cohesion. Their chances now rest on securing comprehensive victories against Canada and Ireland, while also relying on other results to favour them.Pakistan's struggles extend beyond the field, with uncertainties surrounding Babar Azam 's leadership and internal team dynamics adding to their woes. The team's batting lineup, in particular, has faltered, with players like Fakhar Zaman and Imad Wasim failing to capitalize on opportunities.Despite notable performances from bowlers like Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir, Pakistan's bowling attack needs to step up, especially premier fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi, who has yet to make a significant impact.In contrast, Canada has shown resilience, bouncing back from a defeat against the USA to secure a crucial win against Ireland. Led by veteran batter Navneet Dhaliwal, Canada poses a formidable challenge, especially after posting a formidable total of 194 against the USA.As Pakistan looks to salvage their campaign, they face a formidable opponent in Canada, who are determined to maintain their momentum in the tournament.Canada (CAN) and Pakistan (PAK) are gearing up for the 22nd T20 International of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. Scheduled to be held at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, the match is set for Tuesday, June 11th, 2024, at 8:00 PM IST.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has proven to be challenging for batsmen, with the pitch offering assistance to bowlers throughout the match. Bowlers who can maintain a consistent line and length are likely to find success, particularly fast bowlers who can exploit any uneven bounce and lateral movement.In the five matches played at this venue, the surface has favoured pacers over spinners. Batsmen have found it difficult to read the ball, leading to lower scores. Only Canada and India have managed to win batting first, indicating the advantage of setting a target.With an average first innings score of 106 and an average second innings score of 104, teams winning the toss may opt to field first and chase, considering the trend of successful chases at this ground.After an impressive performance against India, Naseem Shah has emerged as a key player for Pakistan. With three wickets and 10 runs in the last match, he poses a significant threat to opponents, especially if Pakistan bowls first. Consider him as a strong candidate for captain/vice-captain selection in your Dream11 team.Nicholas Kirton showcased his batting prowess with a brilliant 49-run knock in the previous game. With a total of 100 runs in two matches and a striking strike rate of 151.52, he stands out as a valuable asset for Canada. His consistency with the bat makes him an excellent choice for captain/vice-captain in your fantasy team.Known for his consistency, Pakistani wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan is a reliable run-scorer. Despite a quiet start against the USA, he bounced back with a crucial 31-run innings against India. With his ability to anchor the innings, Rizwan is a dependable pick for your fantasy team.Saad Bin Zafar (captain), Aaron Johnson, Ravinderpal Singh, Navneet Dhaliwal, Kaleem Sana, Dilon Heyliger, Jeremy Gordon, Nikhil Dutta, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Rayyankhan Pathan, Junaid Siddiqui, Dilpreet Bajwa, Shreyas Movva and Rishiv Joshi.Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman KhanWicketkeepers: Mohammad Rizwan(c), Shreyas MovvaBatters: Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Nicholas KirtonAll-Rounders: Imad Wasim, Dillon HeyligerBowlers: Jeremy Gordon, Shaheen Afridi(vc), Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir","Pakistan face Canada in the 22nd T20 International of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

NEW DELHI: In the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024 , Pakistan 's cricket team has faced disappointment, notably with their recent loss to India by a margin of six runs. This defeat adds to their woes following an unexpected loss to the United States in their first group stage match.Despite a commendable effort by bowlers Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf , who both took three wickets each to restrict India to 119 runs, Pakistan couldn't capitalize due to India's disciplined bowling, particularly from Jasprit Bumrah .The defeat not only dims Pakistan's chances of advancing to the Super 8 stage but also highlights the challenges they face in the tournament.Pakistan will face Canada on Tuesday as their third opponent of the ongoing tournament and they need a big win, not only for the valuable two points but to improve their net run rate substantially.The Pakistan cricket team has faced a challenging start in the T20 World Cup 2024 , with two consecutive losses in the group stage.

In this scenario, the qualification will be determined by Net Run Rate, requiring Pakistan to achieve significant margins in their victories to improve their NRR.Given these conditions, Pakistan's path to the Super 8 stage is fraught with challenges, relying not just on their own performance but also on the outcomes of other matches in the group.","Pakistan cricket team has faced a challenging start in the T20 World Cup 2024, with two consecutive losses in the group stage.

(With inputs from the Diplomat)

NEW DELHI: India is planning to rename over two dozen places in China's Tibet Autonomous Region in a tit-for-tat move against China renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh , according to a report in the Diplomat.The list of places to be renamed has been finalised by the Army's information warfare division and will be released soon, said the report by the Diplomat. The new names are backed by extensive historical research and widely held opinions of the local residents, many of whom fiercely oppose the Chinese names.The unit has also been debunking the Chinese names with support from top research institutes like the British-era Asiatic Society based in Kolkata.The renaming campaign aims to push through an Indian counter-narrative on the border through regional and global media, anchored on both solid historical research and local residents' voices.The move comes after Beijing on several instances changed names of places in Arunachal Pradesh.In March, China renamed 30 places along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the state, including 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a piece of land.It was the fourth time that China unilaterally renamed places in the state. Beijing released the first list of the so-called standardised names of six places in Arunachal Pradesh in 2017, the second list of 15 places in 2021, and a third list with names for 11 places in 2023.New Delhi suspects that China's renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh is aimed at strengthening Beijing's territorial claim on the largest province in northeastern India, which China calls Zangnan or ""southern Tibet"".India has repeatedly rejected China's move to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh, asserting that the state is an integral part of the country and that assigning ""invented"" names does not alter this reality.The latest round of efforts by China to reassert its claims over the state started with Beijing lodging a diplomatic protest with India over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's March 2024 visit to Arunachal Pradesh, where he dedicated the Sela Tunnel built at an altitude of 13,000 feet.External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on March 23 dismissed China's repeated claims on Arunachal Pradesh as ""ludicrous"" and stressed that the frontier state was a ""natural part of India"".With Prime Minister Narendra Modi retaining Rajnath Singh as defence minister, it is expected that the list of names will be released soon.Experts said that when India reveals the new names, it will be akin to New Delhi reopening the Tibetan question, which is bound to illicit a sharp reaction from China.",India is planning to rename over two dozen places in China's Tibet Autonomous Region in a tit-for-tat move against China renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh.

Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

First session

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained four of his high-profile ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar of Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths this time, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The NDA's tally is 293 seats -- well above the majority mark of 272 -- and opposition INDIA bloc 234.As per media reports citing sources, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin from June 18 with President Droupadi Murmu expected to address a joint sitting of both Houses on June 21.The MPs in the Lower House are expected to take oaths on June 18-19, following which the Speaker will be elected on June 20.","Narendra Modi takes oath of office for third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India on Monday.

Of this, TDP secured 135, Janasena 21 and BJP 8.After taking charge as the home minister on Tuesday, Amit Shah is scheduled to travel to Andhra where he might meet CM-designate Chandrababu Naidu. According to the sources, Shah will hold a meeting with Naidu on Wednesday ahead of his oath-taking ceremony.The chief ministerial candidate met Andhra governor Abdul Nazeer and staked a claim to form the NDA government in the state.""There was an NDA meeting today in which Chandrababu Naidu was elected as the leader of the NDA Legislative Assembly.

NEW DELHI: Janasena founder and actor Pawan Kalyan is expected to be offered the position of deputy chief minister in the upcoming N Chandrababu Naidu-led government in Andhra Pradesh. TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is set to be sworn in as chief minister on Wednesday.According to PTI, sources within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) said the new government is anticipated to allocate five to six ministerial positions to its allies, Janasena and the BJP . Alongside Pawan Kalyan, Nadendla Manohar, the chairman of Janasena's political affairs committee, is also likely to be included in the cabinet.Pawan Kalyan, who secured a win from the Pithapuram assembly constituency, began his political journey with his elder brother Chiranjeevi, who founded the Praja Rajyam party in 2008. Although Kalyan remained relatively inactive politically after his brother's party merged with Congress, he later established the Janasena party in 2014. While he did not contest the 2014 elections, Kalyan extended his support to the NDA alliance of TDP and BJP, which contributed to their victory.In the 2019 elections, Kalyan faced a significant defeat, losing all seats except one, the Razole assembly seat. However, in the 2024 polls, the 55-year-old actor-politician played a crucial role in forming the NDA alliance of TDP, BJP, and Janasena, leading to a resounding victory.During a recent NDA meeting in the national capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to Kalyan as ""Aandhi (storm),"" highlighting his influence and importance within the alliance.Additionally, TDP leader and Chandrababu Naidu's son, Nara Lokesh, and TDP Andhra Pradesh President K Atchannaidu are also expected to be sworn in alongside the chief minister designate. Nara Lokesh, 41, a former minister who previously managed the Information Technology Ministry of Andhra Pradesh from 2014 to 2019, is a Stanford MBA graduate and has experience working with the World Bank.Despite an initial setback in electoral politics in 2014, when he lost to YSRCP's A Ramakrishna Reddy in the Mangalagiri assembly constituency, Lokesh has gained favor with the electorate over the past five years. His statewide 'Yuva Galam' padayatra was instrumental in securing one of the largest victories in the 2024 polls, winning the Mangalagiri seat by a margin of over 90,000 votes.The BJP is slated to receive two positions in the Andhra Pradesh cabinet.The NDA alliance, consisting of TDP, BJP, and Janasena, achieved a landslide victory in the recent simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the state, securing a commanding majority of 164 assembly and 21 Lok Sabha seats.","Pawan Kalyan is expected to be offered the position of deputy chief minister. TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is set to be sworn in as chief minister on Wednesday. The new government is anticipated to allocate five to six ministerial positions to its allies, Janasena and the BJP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110915925,imgsize-31230,width-400,resizemode-4/110915925.jpg"

Advani, Union Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, and former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh. The NSG also secures former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) President Ghulam Nabi Azad, National Conference (NC) President Farooq Abdullah, and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Chief N. Chandrababu Naidu.The ITBP currently protects senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, NC leader Omar Abdullah, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, among others.The plan to relieve the NSG from VIP security roles has been under consideration since 2012, prompted by concerns that simultaneous terrorist attacks in multiple locations could overextend the NSG's capabilities, necessitating the rapid deployment of their commandos in different directions.Currently, the CRPF and CISF VIP security wings protect more than 200 individuals. The CRPF is responsible for safeguarding Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the Gandhi family, among others, while the CISF protects National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, and additional protectees.",The Union government is likely to undertake a significant overhaul in the VIP security setup with the induction of new ministers.

NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: Heatwave conditions have returned to parts of North India, bringing a surge in temperatures that surpassed 45°C in many regions on Monday, after a brief respite in recent days.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for northwest and east India, predicting a further rise in temperatures by two to three degrees over the next five days.This year, India has already endured multiple intense and prolonged heatwaves in April and May, pushing human endurance and the country's disaster preparedness to their limits. Several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha, reported fatalities due to the extreme heat.Experts attribute the severe heat to the El Nino phenomenon—a warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean—and the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Rapid urbanization has exacerbated warming in cities, disproportionately affecting outdoor workers and low-income households.Climate change has significantly increased the frequency of such heatwaves, making them about 45 times more likely, according to the 'World Weather Attribution' group of leading climate scientists.The central water commission reported that water storage in 150 major reservoirs in India has dropped to just 22 per cent of their live storage capacity, exacerbating water shortages and impacting hydropower generation.The intense heat has driven India's power demand to a record 246 gigawatts, as air conditioners and coolers in homes and offices run at full capacity.From March to May, India recorded nearly 25,000 suspected heat stroke cases and 56 heat-related deaths, according to health ministry data. Of these, 46 deaths occurred in May alone, with 19,189 suspected heat stroke cases reported that month.The data, however, does not include figures from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi, suggesting the actual toll may be higher.Severe heatwaves have plagued India for three consecutive years, significantly impacting health, water availability, agriculture, power generation, and other economic sectors.A World Bank report predicts that by 2030, India could account for 34 million of the projected 80 million global job losses due to heat stress-associated productivity decline. Additionally, studies indicate that India faces food losses worth USD 13 billion annually, with only four percent of fresh produce covered by cold chain facilities.","Severe heatwave conditions reported in parts of Gangetic West Bengal, while areas in Uttar Pradesh, south Bihar, Delhi, and Jharkhand also faced intense heat.

NEW DELHI: Newly appointed Union minister of communications , Jyotiraditya Scindia , stressed the pivotal role of the telecom division and India Post on both global and local stages as he assumed office on Tuesday.The 53-year-old son of the late Congress leader Madhavrao Scindia has a significant history in Indian politics, having served as the civil aviation minister in the previous Modi cabinet since 2021.His new role marks a return to a familiar department, as Scindia previously served as the minister of state for communications under the UPA government from 2007 to 2009.""It is a little bit like coming full circle for me because I worked as a junior minister in this department in 2007-2009, and therefore for me, this is also a department with which I've had tremendous emotional ties,"" Scindia said, reflecting on his past experiences.Expressing his gratitude for the opportunity, Scindia highlighted the advancements made under the current administration and pledged to uphold the expectations of the Prime Minister and the people of India.""It is my honour that the Prime Minister has given me the responsibility of the communications ministry. Under his leadership, there has been a revolution in this department. I vow to persevere and put in my best to ensure that we deliver according to the aspirations of the Prime Minister as well as 140 crore people of India,"" Scindia said during his inaugural speech.Scindia chose not to outline immediate priorities, opting instead to first assess the department's current state. However, he faces significant challenges, including overseeing India's 5G spectrum auction set to commence on June 25. This auction is a critical event in the telecom sector, drawing considerable attention.Besides the spectrum auction, where over Rs 96,000 crore worth of airwaves will be on the block, Scindia will also have to prioritise issues like satellite broadband services, security clearance for Elon Musk-led Startlink and formulate rules for the new Telecommunications Act.Another major responsibility for Scindia will be maintaining the structure of India's three-private player telecom market and ensuring the survival of the financially troubled Vodafone Idea, where the government holds the largest stake.Scinida will have to set the ball rolling on a 100-day agenda that would outline clear priority areas, key deliverables, roadmaps and targets for the telecom sector.Scindia, who takes over the baton from Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, inherits a sector with improved financial metrics, lower litigations, and lesser uncertainty following the disposal of several cases in courts.Scindia's ministerial journey started as Minister of State for telecom, Post and IT under then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led UPA-1 regime. He was instrumental in driving post office modernisation with the Project Arrow scheme.As a minister in the Modi 3.0 government, Scindia will have the challenge of reviving state-run telecom firm BSNL and settling the debt issues of MTNL.The new minister also has the challenge of resolving the threat posed by fraudulent calls and the persistent issue of pesky calls.Scindia, who was the aviation minister in the previous Modi government, won from Guna in Madhya Pradesh by more than 5.40 lakh votes.","Jyotiraditya Scindia assumed office as Union minister of communications on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Congress and other opposition parties on Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi should pay heed to the ‘advice’ of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and visit Manipur which has seen violence for over a year now, a day after Bhagwat said the situation in the strife-torn state must be considered a priority.While Congress general secretarysaid Bhagwat can perhaps prevail upon the “former RSS officebearer” to go to the northeastern state, independent MP Kapil Sibal said it is “not in DNA” of the PM to listen to advice of opposition but he should pay attention to the words of the RSS chief.RJD functionary Tejashwi Yadav said Bhagwat has aired his concerns a bit too late and claimed that the Prime Minister has maintained “silence” on every crisis including Manipur.“The PM, on his part, has merely kept silent on every crisis, be it violence in that state, or protests by farmers and female wrestlers in Delhi,” he said.Manipur plunged into violence between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May last year. Since then some 200 people have been killed, while thousands have been displaced following large-scale arson that has gutted homes and govt buildings.

NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda took charge of the health ministry on Tuesday. He also held a meeting with senior officials of the ministry who briefed him about ongoing projects. This includes the rolling out of the U-WIN platform to digitise all routine immunisation records .

The U-WIN portal, which is a replication of the Co-WIN platform that was used for Covid-19 vaccination and issuing certificates, is being used currently in multiple states on a trial basis to digitise records of routine immunisations.

Sources said the functioning of Ayushman Bharat Yojana and its potential extension to include senior citizens (70 years and above) was also mentioned in the meeting.

BJP had, in its election manifesto, promised to extend the beneficiary base of Ayushman Bharat, one of the largest health insurance schemes in the world that offers Rs 5 lakh health coverage on an annual basis to the poor and vulnerable families, to include elderly persons who are aged 70 years and above regardless of their economic background.

This is a significant promise since many elderly people, especially those who retired from private jobs or did their own business, find it difficult to get health insurance and even if they manage to get one, the premium is prohibitively expensive. Nadda didn't make any statement about his agenda for the ministry but, in a post on X, he wrote: ""The ministry of health and family welfare plays a crucial role in the nation's progress and the well-being of its people.

Importantly, the outgoing chief’s remark where he said BJP had grown powerful enough to do without RSS’s support is said to have annoyed the Sangh leadership.His shift to govt notwithstanding, Nadda, whose three-year tenure got over in Jan and was extended by six months because of Lok Sabha polls, will continue as party president until the process to elect his successor is completed. Although there is no bar on a person simultaneously serving in the organisation and govt, adherence to one person-one post policy has been the convention. As per the party’s constitution, the national chief is elected by an electoral college consisting of members of national and state councils. Any 20 members of the electoral college of a state can propose any person who has been an active member for four terms and has 15 years of membership. The joint proposal, however, should come from not less than five states where elections have been completed for the national council. There is speculation that a woman could be elevated as the chief in view of the emphasis BJP has laid on women in the recent past with PM Narendra Modi acknowledging women voters’ decisive role in his three consecutive wins. No woman has headed the party so far.BJP is planning an extensive outreach campaign to increase the number of women members in the organisation — one of the main reasons why many see the next party chief being a woman a reasonable prospect. As per the women’s quota Act, 33% of seats in Lok Sabha and state assemblies will be reserved for women, which is likely by the next Lok Sabha polls in 2029. By then, the party will need strong bench strength to select potential candidates.",The process to elect his successor is likely in the next few days. A decision on nominating a working president pending election of a full-time chief will be taken by the party brass. There is speculation that a woman could be elevated as the chief in view of the emphasis BJP has laid on women.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110922150,imgsize-53648,width-400,resizemode-4/110922150.jpg"

It is very much part of govt's agenda."" On UCC, the minister was not very forthcoming but made it clear that it was part of BJP's poll manifesto.In keeping with directives from PM Narendra Modi, Meghwal signed off on the National Litigation Policy (NLP), which aims at bringing down pendency, on his first day in office. It will now be sent to the cabinet for approval. Meghwal said NLP will facilitate ease of living for citizens and involve all stakeholders - lawyers, litigants and govt. ""We have to develop a culture of ease of living, as envisaged by PM,"" he added.The policy has been in the works for at least a decade-and-a-half. UPA govt had first floated the proposal to bring down long pendency of cases in courts.The idea was taken forward by NDA govt when it framed broad guidelines to reduce pendency. As part of the policy, it was made compulsory for all govts, both at the Centre and states, to encourage incorporating arbitration and mediation clauses in contracts. Govt being the largest litigant in the country, a target was proposed for all departments to reduce cases and make it part of their results framework.It also provided for meeting of secretaries of respective departments, both at central and state levels, to review implementation of the policy. Law departments were to periodically convene meetings of nodal officers and weed out infructuous cases with fixed timelines. If cases could be addressed through grievance redressal mechanism, such cases should be withdrawn.Meghwal said providing ease of living and bringing down pendency of cases from all courts were among the top priorities of government.","Arjun Ram Meghwal signed off on National Litigation Policy (NLP) on his first day in office.

RSS journal says poll results ‘reality check’ for ‘overconfident’ BJP netas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-journal-says-poll-results-reality-check-for-overconfident-bjp-netas/articleshow/110920378.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha poll results have come as a reality check for “overconfident” BJP workers and many of its leaders as they were happy in their “bubble” and enjoying the glow of PM Modi’s aura but did not have their ear to the ground, RSS organ ‘Organiser’ said in an article in its latest edition.The write-up by RSS member Ratan Sharda, titled ‘Modi 3.0: Conversation for course correction’, came amid intense discussion on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech on Monday in which he said a “true sevak has no ego (ahankar)”. Modi has consistently styled himself as the “pradhan sevak”. Sharda’s article said though RSS was not a “field force” of BJP, party leaders and workers failed to reach out to its ‘swayamsevaks’ (volunteers) for their cooperation in electoral work.Bhagwat had said: “He who is a real servant has no limitations. Everyone does the work. But it is important to follow the limits while working. We work with limits. The worker adheres to that limit. That limit is our religion and culture. One who follows limits does not engage in karma. He has no ego (ahankar). He is the true servant.”During the campaign, BJP chief J P Nadda had said in a media interview that the party had grown and could handle its own affairs and did not need RSS the way it did earlier.In his article, Sharda said, “Results of 2024 general elections have come as a reality check for overconfident BJP karyakartas and many leaders. They did not realise that PM Narendra Modi ji’s call of 400-plus (seats) was a target for them and a dare to the opposition.”Sharda, who has authored many books on RSS, noted that targets were achieved by hard work in the field, not by sharing posters and selfies on social media. “Since they were happy in their bubble, enjoying the glow reflected from Modi ji’s aura, they were not listening to voices on the streets,” he said.The idea that Modi was fighting on all 543 Lok Sabha seats had “limited value”, Sharda wrote. “This idea became self-defeating when candidates were changed, imposed at the cost of local leaders and defectors were given more importance. Sacrificing even well performing parliamentarians to accommodate latecomers hurt. It is estimated that around 25% of candidates were seasonal migrants,” he added.Sharda also flagged “unnecessary politicking” as a reason behind BJP’s underperformance. “Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split Shiv Sena had a comfortable majority. BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value,” he said.On whether RSS worked for BJP in this election, Sharda said, “Let me say bluntly, RSS is not a field force of BJP. BJP has its own karyakartas. If BJP volunteers don’t reach out to RSS, they have to answer why they thought it was not required.”","The write-up by RSS member Ratan Sharda, titled ‘Modi 3.0: Conversation for course correction’, came amid intense discussion on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech on Monday in which he said a “true sevak has no ego (ahankar)”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110920413,imgsize-25028,width-400,resizemode-4/110920413.jpg"
