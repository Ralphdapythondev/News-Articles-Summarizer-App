Clear increase in deaths

Stray dog menace

On March 26, 1993, The New York Times published a photograph of an emaciated Sudanese child stalked by a vulture. The child survived, the photograph won a Pulitzer in 1994, and the photographer, Kevin Carter, committed suicide the same year.Something else happened in ’93 that went unnoticed. The patent on a 20-year-old drug expired. This drug was the common painkiller diclofenac, found in products like Volini, Voveran, etc.Until 1993, its supply was controlled by the Swiss pharma firm Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis ), but with the patent over, generic production took off. Prices crashed everywhere. In Sri Lanka, for example, generic diclofenac cost Re 1, as against Rs 8 for the branded product in August 1995.It happened in India, too. After all, Indian generic manufacturers were driving down diclofenac’s price. The result was that in 1994, veterinary use of diclofenac became common. Farmers started using it to treat “injuries, inflammations and fevers in wounded or sick animals”. It made sense because diclofenac was cheap, easily available, and worked in 15 minutes.But then, something else that nobody had imagined happened. Indian vultures started dying in large numbers. By the time the link between vulture deaths and diclofenac in animal carcasses was discovered, it was too late. India’s vulture population was practically annihilated. From almost 40 million in the early 1990s, vultures became rare in the early 2000s.But that’s an old story. Now, a new report byresearchers Eyal Frank and Anant Sudarshan claims the loss of vultures indirectly led to hundreds of thousands of human deaths.In their paper titled ‘The Social Costs of Keystone Species Collapse: Evidence From The Decline of Vultures in India’, Frank and Sudarshan say: “The functional extinction of vultures…increased human mortality by over 4%.”It might not sound like a huge change, but we are talking about human lives here, not car mileage. If 100,000 people die every year in a country, a 4% change means 4,000 additional deaths. The researchers claim “an average of 104,386 additional deaths a year” between 2000 and 2005. They have also estimated the economic loss to the country from these additional deaths: almost $70 billion per year.Humans drove cheetahs to extinction and brought tigers to its verge without suffering serious consequences. So, why did the near-extinction of vultures prove so harmful? The answer to that question lies in the word ‘keystone’ in the title of Frank and Sudarshan’s paper. They describe vultures as a keystone species because “if they are removed, the effects on the ecosystem are potentially large”.That’s not an exaggeration. For a moment, go back to Carter’s photograph of the Sudanese child. Why was the vulture waiting for it to die? The answer is: vultures have evolved as scavengers, not predators, although occasionally you hear rumours of them killing livestock.When it comes to scavenging, they are unmatched. Frank and Sudarshan say a flock of vultures – the precise word is ‘committee’ – can reduce a 385kg cow carcass to bones in 40 minutes. Dogs and rats also scavenge but they aren’t so efficient. They leave behind a lot of flesh on the bones to rot, and dogs spread rabies themselves.So, for thousands of years, vultures shouldered the municipal task of scavenging in India’s towns and villages. Farmers reared animals, and when the animals died vultures promptly took care of the carcasses. India has always had very large livestock populations – 500 million, per the 2019 livestock census – and the report estimates the 40-odd million vultures in India till 1993 could have consumed meat equivalent to the weight of 27 million cows in a year. That’s 10.4 billion kilos of meat.By removing millions of tonnes of flesh from the environment, vultures not only contained the spread of pathogens but also curbed the numbers of other scavengers like rats and feral dogs, which spread the deadly rabies virus.As the vulture population melted away, Frank and Sudarshan say ‘animal landfills’ emerged outside towns and villages. Burying carcasses deep in the ground or incinerating them was expensive, so they were dumped “on the outskirts of population centres across India”. Sometimes, the carcasses were dumped in water, or fluids leaching from their rotting bodies flowed into water bodies.Frank and Sudarshan carefully examined death rates before and after the decline of vulture populations. For their analysis, they separately studied areas that originally had large vulture populations, and those that didn’t. The data showed areas that were unsuitable for vultures used to have marginally higher death rates (1.2 extra deaths per 1,000 people) between 1988 and 1993.The researchers suggest this might have been because the areas with fewer vultures – cooler and drier places – had a problem of rotting carcasses leading to disease and death.But when vulture numbers fell dramatically in 1996, the death rate in areas that had always had bigger vulture populations became higher by “0.65 deaths per 1,000 people”. By 2005, the gap had increased to 1.4 additional deaths per 1,000 people.And this “sanitation shock” due to the disappearance of vultures was felt more strongly in urban areas that didn’t have vast open spaces to dispose of carcasses. Also, their “significantly higher population density, and network infrastructure such as drains allowing pathogens and waste to spread rapidly” made the situation worse. Frank and Sudarshan say, “We find that urban areas experienced a larger increase in death rates relative to the combined sample.”Dog bites and rabies are big problems in India. On July 30, the government informed Parliament that there were 3 million dog bite cases in 2023, and 4.7 million rabies shots were given. Still, 286 people died.The study suggests India’s dog population multiplied when vulture populations declined. The same dead animals that vultures removed meticulously were now available to dogs to devour. And dogs, unlike vultures, breed rapidly.Frank and Sudarshan cite the spurt in demand for rabies shots after 1996 as evidence of a sharp increase in dog numbers, following the decimation of vulture populations.","Vultures have evolved as scavengers, not predators. For thousands of years, vultures shouldered the municipal task of scavenging in India. But in 1993, the patent on a 20-year-old drug expired.

"India, UK discuss Bangladesh but suspense remains over Hasina",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-asylum-suspense-uk-counterpart-calls-up-eam/articleshow/112387774.cms,"NEW DELHI: UK foreign secretary David Lammy dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar Thursday amid the suspense over where deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , who fled to India from Dhaka on Monday, might be headed. Jaishankar said in a post on X that the leaders discussed the situation in Bangladesh and West Asia.The UK government said after the call that it remains in touch with India and other partners in the region to monitor and respond to the ""latest events"" in Bangladesh.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), however, didn’t confirm if India had discussed the issue of asylum for Hasina with the UK or any other country, saying it did not have an update on her travel plans and it was up to her to take things forward.""She was allowed to come here at very short notice. The situation is still evolving. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on her travel plans,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.In the current circumstances, it’s unlikely though that she will be able to leave Delhi in the next few days, if not longer. As Jaishankar had said in Parliament, Hasina had sought approval to come ""for the moment"" to India. While she is yet to officially apply for asylum, it’s believed that she would prefer going to the US or UK. However, it’s not possible to apply for asylum from outside the UK under their immigration rules. According to the UK, the fastest route to safety for anyone is to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach. In Hasina’s case, the first country she reached is India.It's not easy for India though to take a decision, given it can’t possibly expel Hasina, with whom successive Indian governments have had cordial ties, and allowing her an extended stay may rile the new government, something India can ill afford to do now. The media in Dhaka Wednesday reported a call by the local Supreme Court Bar Association for India to arrest Hasina and deport her back.The UK’s position on Hasina in the past was also vastly different from the way India handled her, and that has reflected in the way London has reacted to her dramatic fall. While seeking a peaceful and democratic future for Bangladesh, Lammy said after Hasina’s exit that the people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks. Any such probe is certain to delve into Hasina’s role, including her role to deploy troops on the streets, in the violence that left more than 400 dead in the past 2 months. The UK joined the US in declaring that the elections in January this year, in which Hasina secured her 4th term in office, were not free, fair and credible, even though India went out on a limb to defend her, mainly because of her efforts to tackle Islamic extremism.","UK foreign secretary David Lammy dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar Thursday amid the suspense over where deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina might be headed.

Hasina ’s excessive use of force against the protesters was said to have hastened her departure.While discussing the threat to Indian citizens, government sources also said Thursday that the Indian high commission in Dhaka in coordination with the Bangladesh army was facilitating ""safe passage"" for Indian nationals to the border.In its first remarks on the situation in Dhaka after Hasina’s exit, the ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) underscored the primacy of the people’s interests.""The situation is evolving, and it’s been reported that this evening the interim government will be sworn in. Once those things are in place, we’d like to emphasise that as far as the Indian government and the people of India are concerned, the interest of the people of Bangladesh is foremost in our minds,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Widely seen as the principal backer of Hasina, and with the former PM still here in the absence of any asylum offer from the West, India has been treading cautiously on developments in Bangladesh. Unlike the US, India has so far not called for respecting the need to uphold democratic principles or the rule of law.However, the government has remained in touch with authorities in Dhaka, including the military, to ensure the safe of Indian citizens and the minority Hindu community. While recalling the deep concern that Jaishankar expressed for minorities in his statement in Parliament, the Indian officials also said, ""we want to make it very clear that it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the well-being of its citizens, and we hope for early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh"".According to Indian officials, the mission in Dhaka has facilitated movement of Indian nationals including project personnel across the land borders. ""Some of these situations were life threatening,"" said a source, adding movement of the members of IRCON Khulna, L&T, RITES, Tata Projects, Afcons and Transrail sirajganj was facilitated through the land border.""Mission has also facilitated consular cases including immigration. Emergency Certificates have been issued to Indian nationals to facilitate their travel in emergency cases. It hasensured that airlines continue to operate and not discontinue the services, which serves as a big enabler to ensure that people are not left stranded,"" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.","India has so far, unlike the US, not welcomed the formation of an interim government in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday asked the new regime in Bangladesh to ensure safety of beleaguered Hindus and other minority communities who have been under attack from violent mobs rampaging through the country since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as PM.Modi extended his best wishes to the Nobel Prize-winning economist who took over as head of an interim govt in Bangladesh.“My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,” the PM said on X, his first remarks since the chaotic resignation of Hasina on Monday.Modi also conveyed his desire to work with the new regime in Bangladesh which under Hasina remained sensitive to India’s security concerns.India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.The PM’s message to Yunus to protect Hindus and other minority communities came amid violence which has seen them being targeted and their properties and temples destroyed by violent mobs.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his ministry had raised the campaign against minority communities but Modi went far beyond in making a reference to “Hindus”, who have borne the brunt of a systematic campaign of violence that appears to have been organised by radicals and known anti-India forces.Also, unlike in the case of Jaishankar who briefed Parliament in the immediate wake of Sheikh Hasina’s resignation and when no govt was in place in Dhaka, Modi’s message was aimed at Yunus as the head of the interim govt.Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi too congratulated Yunus for his new assignment, while emphasising the importance of fast restoration of peace and normalcy. “Congratulations to Professor Muhammad Yunus on being sworn in as head of Bangladesh’s interim govt.

NEW DELHI: In a move that could help expedite the launch of cutting-edge therapies in India, the Centre has decided to waive local trials for drugs and vaccines that are more advanced than current standards and have been approved in US, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada and EU. These can be launched in Indian market directly, subject to approval from CDSCO, India’s top drug regulatory body, according to an executive order issued by govt.USA, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada and EU have strong regulatory mechanisms in place for drug approval .Local trials were required in most cases until now, among other reasons, to rule out any potential difference in the safety and efficacy of drugs on Indian population. A top health ministry official said such differences can affect 0.1 to 0.2% of the population.“For that, we did not want to deprive the rest of the patients/population who may be needing those medicines, hence this decision,” the official said. “There have been multiple instances in the past when reputed firms postponed or faced delays in launch of a new drug that had been already approved in major markets such as the EU because they couldn’t undertake or complete local trials. Govt order will do away with this need,” he added.One of the examples of drug categories that may benefit from govt decision is Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that are already approved in the US for treating leukaemia. They might get speedy approval for use in India as well. Sacituzumab govitecan, used to treat breast cancer that has spread in the body, isn’t available in India currently. With this new govt policy, this drug may soon find a way into the Indian market, Dr P Raghu Ram, founding director of Hyderabad-based KIMS — Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Cancer Diseases, said.Dr Pooja Sharma, project lead, patient advocates for Clinical Research (PACER), said local clinical trials were earlier considered an important part of the drug regulatory process in India to ensure that genetic, metabolic and other local differences may be factored in while giving approval.Dr Sharma said this will not mean any increased risk because the regulator will ensure post marketing monitoring through surveillance and post marketing clinical trials.","The Centre has decided to waive local trials for drugs and vaccines that are more advanced than current standards.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday directed setting up of a high-powered committee of the Cabinet secretary, secretaries of ministries of jal shakti, power and environment & forests along with chief secretary of Uttrakhand to reconsider the expert panel ’s report recommending approval for 28 hydro power projects.It questioned Centre’s decision not to accept the report, and to allow only seven of the projects without giving any reason.“You have to show the decision-making process is rational,” it said.A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan said the expert panel comprised members from various fields and govt did not give any reason for not accepting the report. The bench said it cannot question the decision but can certainly examine the decision-making process.“You have to satisfy that the report was duly considered and reasons were given to accept or reject the report. What compelled you to only allow seven projects? When an expert committee was appointed on the direction of the court then you have to show reasons for not accepting it,” the bench told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who was appearing for the Centre.Bhati told the bench there were differences of opinion among different ministries — power and environment & forests on one side and jal shakti on the other — and there was consensus on only seven projects due to which they were approved. Besides, she added, these projects were at an advanced stage of construction.The hydro power projects in the state came under judicial scrutiny after the 2013 floods. Taking suo motu cognisance, SC had banned further construction of all such projects. Taking into account the huge investments made by companies in seven projects, SC had asked the Centre to appoint an expert committee to study the environmental and ecological impact of the projects. The seven projects were Tehri Stage II (on Bhagirathi river), Tapovan Vishnugad (Dhauligangan river), Vishnugad Pipalkoti (Alaknanda), Singoli Bhatwari and Phata Buyong (Mandakini), Madhyamaheswar (Madhmaheshwar Ganga) and Kaliganga II (Kaliganga).Opposing the findings of the report, it was submitted by advocate Prashant Bhushan that members of the expert committee which approved the projects were also involved in clearing the projects before the flood disaster . He said that another panel headed by veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra had blamed dams for exacerbating the 2013 disaster and the court should not give credence to expert panel recommendations for approving the projects, which would further damage the environment.The court asked the panel of secretaries to consider all aspects and give a hearing to all stakeholders and take a decision within six months. It directed the committee to file minutes of its meeting before the court.","The hydro power projects in the state came under judicial scrutiny after the 2013 floods.

'Vinesh Phogat to be felicitated like a medallist'

NEW DELHI: A disappointed and heartbroken Indian wrestler, Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday following her disqualification from the Paris Olympics. Vinesh shared an emotional message on social media.She was disqualified after being found 100 grams overweight during the weigh-in ahead of her gold medal match.“Maa, kushti mere se jeet gayi, main haar gayi.Maaf karna, aapka sapna, meri himmat sab toot chuke. Isse zyada taqat nahi rahi ab” (Mom, Wrestling has defeated me, I have lost. I lost…my courage is all broken, I don't have any more strength now),” Vinesh wrote on her social media account.""Alvida, kushti (Goodbye Wrestling 2001-2024),” she concluded.Vinesh made history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category on Tuesday. She was assured of at least a silver medal before the disqualification.Vinesh's disqualification from the final match against Sarah Ann Hildebrandt of the United States due to being 100gm overweight during the morning weigh-in was the most devastating setback of the day. The 29-year-old wrestler was utterly shattered by the turn of events.In response to her disqualification, Vinesh filed an appeal, requesting that she be awarded a joint silver medal. She was replaced in the final by Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Vinesh had defeated in the semifinals. Lopez ultimately lost to Hildebrandt in the championship match.As per international regulations, any wrestler found to be overweight during the weigh-in process will automatically be placed at the bottom of the final standings, regardless of their performance in the tournament.Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha voiced her shock and disappointment over Vinesh's disqualification.""After hearing the news that Vinesh Phogat is disqualified, I am shocked and disappointed. I had come here to meet Vinesh; she is physically and medically okay. Mentally, she is disappointed. Our support staff is with her, trying their best to help her reduce weight,"" PT Usha said.Previously, Dinshaw Pardiwala, Chief Medical Officer of the Indian Olympic contingent, disclosed that Phogat was 2.7 kg over the weight limit following her semi-final bout. He mentioned that efforts were made to help her reduce weight by restricting her food and water intake.Following her disqualification on Wednesday, Vinesh also appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).According to an IOA source, Vinesh requested the CAS to award her the silver medal.""Vinesh Phogat has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against her disqualification, asking for the silver medal. CAS will give its verdict tomorrow morning,"" the source had told ANI.Vinesh is a three-time Olympian and has won gold medals in both the Asian and Commonwealth Games.For the last 12 months, she has been at the forefront of intense demonstrations against the previous Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from female wrestlers.Vinesh, a consistent competitor in the 53kg weight class, had to make the difficult transition to 50kg just a few months prior to the Games, as Antim Panghal had already secured the Paris quota spot in that category.Panghal suffered a defeat in the first round and now confronts potential deportation after attempting to grant her sister Nisha access to the Games Village using her own accreditation card.The Chief Minister of Haryana, Nayab Singh Saini, announced on Thursday that the state government will honor wrestler Vinesh in the same manner as they would an Olympic medalist.Despite not winning a medal, Vinesh will receive a reward equivalent to that of an Olympic silver medalist.Saini said in a post on X, ""Our brave daughter of Haryana, Vinesh Phogat, performed brilliantly and entered the final of the Olympics. She might not have been able to compete in the final due to some reason but she is a champion for all of us.""""Our government has decided that Vinesh Phogat will be welcomed and felicitated like a medallist.

Will be tough to cooperate with India if it helps our enemy Hasina: BNP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-be-tough-to-cooperate-with-india-if-it-helps-our-enemy-hasina-bnp/articleshow/112385419.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main rival of Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League party, is clearly unhappy with India hosting the ousted Prime Minister after she fled Dhaka and arrived here on Monday.Veteran BNP functionary Gayeshwar Roy, who was a minister in the BNP-led govt in 1991, and is a member of the party’s standing committee, its highest decision-making forum, told TOI from Dhaka, “BNP believes Bangladesh and India must have mutual cooperation...Indian govt will have to understand and behave in a manner which follows that spirit. But if you help our enemy then it becomes difficult for that mutual cooperation to be honoured. Our former foreign minister (in the Hasina govt) said here before the last elections that India will help Sheikh Hasina’s return to office. Sheikh Hasina’s liability is being borne by India... Indian and Bangladesh people don’t have issues with each other. But should India promote one party and not the entire country?” Roy was replying to questions that BNP is perceived to have anti-India bias.Asked about reports of alleged attacks on Hindus and the perception about BNP being anti-minority, Roy said, “A perception has been created that BNP is anti-Hindu. BNP is made up of people from different communities in Bangladesh and stands for all religions. I have been a minister in this party’s regime and am ranked high enough in the BNP’s highest decision-making forum. BNP is a nationalist party but we believe in the individual rights of all communities.”“When I was a minister in 1991, I started the system of donations for Durga Pujas and no govt after that has stopped the policy, it is still on. It is our party’s govt that did it,” he added. On the concern about terrorist elements targeting India using Bangladesh, Roy said, “It is a perception again. Not the truth. India has helped in getting our Independence... we cannot be against India.”“We are a smaller country, we need India for many things including medical facilities, many other goods for our people, but the revenue that India earns from Bangladeshis on these accounts are also not a small amount,” he said.Asked about BNP’s equation with Jamaat-e-Islami , Roy made it clear “it’s not an ideological relationship. It is tactical support, which has to do with electoral politics.”“Awami League was in an official alliance with the Jamaat. From 2018 to 2024 we (BNP) had no relations with the Jamaat. There was Left, there was right, but there was no Jamaat with us. Sheikh Hasina took the Jamaat on board. Later she created Hefazat-e-Islam group to counter Jamaat. Today the same Hefazat is on the streets against Awami League. Jamaat believes in elections,” he said.On the new interim govt formation process, Roy said “since the students wanted Dr Mohammad Yunus as the leader and a non-political govt as an interim arrangement, BNP did not suggest any names from the party”.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is the main rival of Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League party.

Dhankhar, however, disallowed it. He then told O’Brien, who was up on his feet, that his conduct was unbecoming. “You (O’Brien) are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door,” he said.The opposition parties then staged a walkout. “We have seen the dark days... the ugliest phase of democracy during the Emergency... It starts with a challenge to Parliamentary institutions,” Dhankhar said.“They (opposition) think they are the only ones whose hearts are bleeding. The entire nation, from the President to the PM to myself and others, is feeling the pain because of our girl (Phogat),” he said, adding the opposition’s bid to “politicise” and “monetise” the matter was the “greatest disrespect” to the wrestler herself.Leader of the House J P Nadda also condemned the opposition’s disrespect for the Chair and democratic traditions, saying it simply did not have “solid” issues to discuss. The entire country is behind Phogat he said.Expressing anguish that he was not getting the desired support from the opposition to run the House despite him making all efforts, Dhankhar said, “They are not challenging me they think that the person who is sitting on this Chair is not capable.”“I am not running away from the oath. But what I have seen today, the way a member has behaved, the way the opposition bench has behaved, I am not finding myself in a position to sit here for some time,” Dhankar said, adding he was leaving the House “with a heavy heart”.Deputy Chairperson Harivansh then chaired the zero hour proceedings. Returning to the Chair around mid-way into the question hour, Dhankhar said, “I left my seat to introspect. Having witnessed (the scene)... which I found was unprecedented, and indigestible.” He announced he has called a meeting of floor leaders at 1.30 PM to discuss the matter.","Rajya Sabha Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar left the House for some time after an uproar and walkout by MPs not allowed to raise wrestler Vinesh Phogat ’s disqualification from the Olympics.

NEW DELHI: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which aims to drastically change the Waqf Act and has attracted resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies , was referred to a joint parliamentary committee on Thursday for scrutiny after govt cleared its first stress test in Lok Sabha by getting the support of ‘secular’ constituents of NDA — TDP and JD(U).Soon after tabling the bill in Lok Sabha, it was Kiren Rijiju, minority affairs minister, who proposed to send the bill for further parliamentary scrutiny despite the majority arrayed in favour of the legislation , which seeks to introduce oversight on the powers of Waqf Boards, which in the current scheme of things can declare any property to be a Waqf asset.Govt offering to get the legislation examined by a parliamentary panel , which would comprise members of the two Houses belonging to major political parties, is seen as reflecting the recognition of the sensitive nature of the Bill, which has been dubbed “communal” by Muslim bodies and politicians, and appears to be aimed at warding off controversies sparked by contentious legislations; for instance, the one brought for farm sector reforms.Rijiju’s announcement also came as a surprise because the support for the legislation from BJP’s ‘secular’ allies TDP and JD(U), which are wary of appearing to be insensitive to Muslim causes, guaranteed passage of the law which has done away with the provision requiring CEOs and members of Waqf Boards to be Muslims. Instead, it has brought in district magistrates as an oversight on the crucial decision on whether a particular property is to be declared a Waqf asset.The bill also makes cases related to Waqf properties subject to the ‘statute of limitations’, thus addressing the complaint that the boards could arbitrarily declare any property, no matter how old, as belonging to waqf.Defending govt amid protests from opposition, TDP’s G M Harish Balyogi said his party believes that registration of property as proposed in this Bill would help poor Muslims & women by bringing transparency. “Purpose of donors needs to be protected. But when the purpose and power get misused, it becomes responsibility of govt to bring in reforms and introduce transparency,” he said.JD-U’s Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’, animal husbandry and panchayati raj minister, dismissed opposition’s charges as an attempt to mislead people and said the legislation aimed to bring transparency in the functioning of Waqf Boards. Referring to a comparison drawn by Congress with the Ayodhya and Guruvayur temple boards, the JD(U) functionary said the analogy was incorrect as the Waqf Bill sought to regulate the functioning of an organisation and not interfere with the administration of a mosque. Singh also questioned Congress’s secular credentials by reminding it about its role in the Sikh riots.The stand of the two allies, TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12), which together add 28 MPs to BJP’s 240 along with seven of Shiv Sena and five of LJP, among others, should guarantee passage of the Bill in LS once it has been examined by the joint parliamentary committee. Govt is comfortably placed in RS, too. While Shrikant Shinde of Shiv Sena spoke strongly in favour of the Bill, the Uddhav Thackeray faction was conspicuous by its silence.","Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which aims to drastically change the Waqf Act, has attracted resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies.

But look at the persons from district judiciary who after being appointed as HC judges have a tenure of less than four to five years. They get a pension of Rs 15-25,000. Their tenure in the district judiciary is not counted. We have a slew of petitions by such retired HC judges.”“To get a pension of Rs 15-25,000 after spending the entire life in the judiciary is no social security for them. Look at the profile of such retired HC judges. They, except a few who can be counted on fingertips, do not return to practice nor do arbitration work after retirement. My earnest appeal to both of you (AG and SG) to sit down with the concerned officials (of the ministry) and examine the issue to arrive at a reasonable solution,” the CJI said.Though the AG reiterated that the issue involves multiple aspects, the SG said he and the AG would surely examine the issues involved regarding the pension. The CJI said, “We do understand the financial implications. But as the Supreme Court, we must also discharge our duties as the guardian of the judiciary,” he said and posted the matter for hearing on Aug 27.","The Supreme Court expressed grave concern over the pittance of pension received by retired HC judges, who were appointed as HC judges after spending their entire life in the district judiciary.

NEW DELHI: Govt may not face difficulty in getting the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha when it comes up for consideration in the next Parliament session in Nov-Dec as NDA is expected to have adequate numbers in the Upper House by then.In addition to the alliance ’s wins in elections to 12 Rajya Sabha seats on Sept 3, govt will also have the advantage of nominated members if it gets the four vacant seats filled before the next session.The four nominated member seats fell vacant last month.Four more nominated members on board means govt may not need the support of BJP-friendly parties such as AIADMK (four members) to reach the majority mark in the Upper House.The NDA tally, along with six existing nominated members and two independents, is expected to reach 117 after the upcoming polls — just two short of the majority mark of 119 in the House of 237, factoring in eight vacancies including four each from Jammu & Kashmir and the nominated category.If govt fills the four nominated seats, the House strength will be 241 and the majority mark will be 121. Since nominated members invariably go with govt, NDA’s strength will increase from 117 to 121 — the exact majority mark. BJP has 87 members in the Upper House. This number will increase to 94 with party candidates expected to win in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tripura, Assam, Maharashtra and Bihar. Its allies may win in Bihar and Maharashtra.The Sept 3 polls will also work for Congress as the party will get one seat in Telangana, taking its tally to 27 — two more than what it needs to retain the leader of opposition post in Rajya Sabha. With 26 members now, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s fate hangs by a thread.Ten of the 12 seats going to polls on Sept 3 fell vacant as sitting BJP, Congress and RJD members from seven states were elected to Lok Sabha while one member each from Telangana and Odisha resigned and switched over to other parties.In Telangana, Bharat Rashtra Samithi member K Keshava Rao resigned and joined Congress while BJD member from Odisha Mamata Mohanta quit and joined BJP.Prominent Muslim organisations have demanded that govt withdraw the proposed amendments to the waqf bill and engage in a detailed consultation with all stakeholders, including religious leaders and waqf management bodies.The presidents of both factions of Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind put out strong statements opposing the amendments. Maulana Mahmood Madani, president of one of the JUH factions expressed his fears saying that the amendments are “detrimental to the protection of waqf properties”.Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) president Syed Sadatullah Husaini too registered his opposition to the proposed amendments alleging that they are “aimed at diminishing the autonomy and integrity of waqf properties and the communities they serve.”",Govt may not face difficulty in getting the Waqf (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha when it comes up for consideration in the next Parliament session in Nov-Dec.

NEW DELHI: ""Not running away from discussion or scrutiny"" were the words of minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday as he referred the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, to a joint Parliamentary committee for further discussion.The Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha with the aim to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, to address the 2013 amendment.In 2013, the definition of ""permanent dedication"" was revised, changing from ""permanent dedication by a person professing Islam"" to ""permanent dedication by any person."" This amendment is thought to have significantly broadened the scope, allowing anyone to dedicate property to Waqf boards.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has criticized the bill as an intrusion into personal laws. BJP , in a post on X highlighted the key issues with the Waqf Act.""Allowing land to be dedicated as waqf based on usage poses risks of misuse and unauthorized claims on public land,"" it said.Once a property is designated as Waqf, it remains so indefinitely, leading to numerous disputes and claims.Other issues highlighted by the saffron party include ""enhanced powers of the Waqf Board could lead to potential overreach and disputes.""The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to modernize the management of Waqf properties by enhancing women's rights, ensuring equitable representation on the Central Waqf Council and Waqf boards, and reducing litigation.The bill proposes renaming the Act to ""Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Development Act, 1995.""It aims to ensure representation for Muslim women and non-Muslims on Waqf boards and to include ""Aghakhani waqf"" and ""Bohra waqf"" alongside the existing Sunni and Shia Waqf boards.It includes a clause related to the ""welfare, maintenance of widow, divorced woman and orphan in such manner, as may be prescribed by the Central Government.""It addresses the controversial provision concerning ""waqf-alal-aulad,"" clarifying that it will not infringe upon the inheritance rights of the Waqif's heirs, including female heirs.The Bill proposes to repeal Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995 as it gives Waqf boards power to decide if a property falls under Waqf property.It specifies that only lawful owners with the capacity to transfer or dedicate property can create a Waqf.Waqf pertains to properties set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law. Once a property is designated as Waqf, ownership is transferred from the individual making the Waqf (waqif) to Allah, rendering it irrevocable.The irrevocability has led to various disputes including Bengaluru Eidgah ground, claimed as Waqf property since the 1850s, and the Surat Municipal Corporation building, which is claimed due to its historical use as a 'sarai' during the Mughal era.",Waqf pertains to properties set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.

MUMBAI: A cryptic announcement by Pune-based industrialist Yohan Poonawalla and his wife Michelle about a property acquisition in south Mumbai has set tongues wagging in the city’s real estate market. A spokesperson representing the couple said they purchased a mansion in the most coveted and exclusive area of Cuffe Parade in south Mumbai.

Sources said the ground-plus-three-storey property was on sale for several years but added its price could be in the range of Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore only.“MYP Design Studio, under Michelle Poonawalla’s creative helm, will orchestrate the transformation of this architectural gem into the opulent Poonawalla Mansion , the couple’s secondary residence, their primary home being Poonawalla House in Pune.

ASI says Vidisha temple is a mosque,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/asi-statement-sparks-mandir-masjid-row/articleshow/112385063.cms,"Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque.' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups.

BHOPAL: After Bhojshala , a new controversy has emerged in Madhya Pradesh , this time around the ancient Vijay Surya Mandir in MP’s Vidisha that is managed by Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Pictures of this temple had gone viral some time ago for its uncanny resemblance to the new Parliament building. For decades, Hindu devotees have observed religious rituals outside the site on Nag Panchami .This year, however, Hindu groups sought permission to enter the premises and hold puja on Aug 9. District collector Buddesh Vaishya forwarded their request to ASI, which responded by citing a 1951 gazette notification categorizing the site as ‘ Bijamandal Mosque ’. The collector then denied permission for worship, sparking outrage among Hindu groups.They oppose ASI’s classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972. The Vijay Surya Mandir / Bijamandal mosque site — around 60km from Bhopal and barely 10km from Sanchi Stupa — has had a tumultuous history. The ASI-Bhopal circle website says the mosque was constructed on ruins of a Hindu Temple. It is believed to have been built in the 11th-12th Century to honour the Sun God. The temple suffered significant damage during Mughal rule, particularly under the reign of Aurangzeb, after which it was repurposed as a mosque in the 17th Century. However, under Maratha rule, the mosque was relocated, and the site fell into disrepair, say locals.","Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups. They oppose ASI’s classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112385075,imgsize-24278,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112385075.jpg"

Is PMLA review plea ‘appeal in disguise’? SC to examine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-pmla-review-plea-appeal-in-disguise-sc-to-examine/articleshow/112385487.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court , while fixing a batch of petitions seeking review of its 2022 order on validity of various provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act , 2002, has observed whether review petition is an appeal in disguise .A bench of Justices Surya Kant, C T Ravikumar and Ujjal Bhuyan asked whether review proceedings would partake the character of an appeal even if a judgment was “gravely erred”.“Can this partake character of appeal? It is to be seen,” the bench said.The issue is of significance because of limited jurisdiction of review hearing which can be entertained only in case of error in verdict.The petitioners are seeking re-examination of the apex court’s July 27, 2022, order which upheld the stringent regime prescribed for money laundering offences and vast powers enjoyed by the Enforcement Directorate, allowing the agency to arrest people and conduct search and seizure even when no complaint has been filed, making statements made before the agency admissible in court while also putting the burden on the accused to prove his innocence.Interestingly, within a month of the order, the court decided to re-examine the verdict and issued notice to the central government in Aug 2022. It said “at least two of the issues raised in the instant petition require consideration”.In a shot in the arm for the anti-money laundering agency, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar had validated the twin bail conditions as per which the accused could be granted bail only if there were reasonable grounds for the court to believe that he was not guilty and was unlikely to commit an offence while on bail.The provisions, which set the bar for bail very high in PMLA cases, was declared invalid by a two-judge SC bench in 2017 on the ground of being discriminatory but was reintroduced in the law a year later. In the 2022 order, however, a 3-judge bench court justified the twin conditions by saying they were also part of other laws which had stood the test of time and constitutional validity.The court had also said that it was not mandatory for ED to provide a copy of Enforcement Case Information Report, the equivalent of FIR in PMLA cases, to the accused, and it was enough if ED disclosed the grounds of arrest at the time of arrest.","The petitioners are seeking re-examination of the apex court’s July 27, 2022, order.

While Bandyopadhyay reminded the chair that land being a state subject, the bill was “unconstitutional, divisive and against federalism”, Kanimozhi said the bill was against Muslims and minorities.Premachandran said the Waqf (Amendment) Bill was intended to disempower Waqf Boards as it would be for the collector or the govt to certify whether a property was a Waqf property or not. “They are removing Section 104. Then, removing Section 40 means that there is no need for Waqf Boards. Waqf Boards become totally powerless.

This is a rise of 7.3 lakh voters since the last revision of the electoral roll before the Lok Sabha polls in April.Significantly, the rise in women voters is higher than men during these four months. The number of women voters has risen by 3.9 lakh while the number of male voters has increased by 3.4 lakh between April and August, the data shows.Still, the total number of male voters outnumbers female voters in the state. The number of male voters is 4.9 crores compared to 4.5 crore women voters.The rise in women voters reflects the national trend and explains why the Mahayuti government is focusing on women ahead of the state assembly polls slated for October 2023.The government’s Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana will provide a stipend of Rs 1,500 per month to underprivileged women. The Mukhya Mantri Annapurna Yojana will provide three free cylinders annually to women from underprivileged homes. The state is also funding the higher education of girls from the OBC and EWS section. All these schemes were announced in June, in the Mahayuti government’s last budget before the polls.The number of women voters outnumber male voters in four districts , the data shows. In the Konkan near Mumbai, the district of Ratnagiri has as many as 42,247 more women voters while adjoining Sindhudurg has 1,654 more women voters than male voters.The tribal district of Nandurbar in North Maharashtra has 2,754 more women voters than male voters. The tribal district of Gondia in Vidarbha has 10,880 more women voters.The district of Bhandara which adjoins Gondia in Vidarbha could soon join this tally. It has only 1,583 more male voters than female voters. In Vidarbha’s Gadchiroli too, there are only 6,937 male voters compared to women.“Given the lack of job opportunities in the Konkan, male members of the family have traditionally migrated to Mumbai for work and they tend to register their vote in the city. The wives remain behind and retain their vote in their native district,” said a senior official from the state’s chief electoral office.Large numbers of men from the tribal belt Bhandara-Gondia also tend to migrate to the border district of Chhatisgarh. The tribal belt of Nandurbar also sees work-related migration.Officials say that the rise in the registration of women voters is the result of special drives. In 2019, the gender ratio in the state electoral roll was 911 women per 1000 men. It has now risen to 923 after the state’s electoral office focused on increasing the registration of women voters.","M Maharashtra has almost 9.4 crore voters according to the latest draft electoral roll.

The loan along with interest was repaid without any development of the 4.3 hectare land parcel, the federal auditor said in a report tabled in the Parliament on Thursday.CAG’s compliance audit report mentioned that the railway ministry in March 2018 gave “in principle” for an MoU between Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and IRCON and get lease premium upfront by transferring the development of land lease rights to the PSUs for generation of no-fare revenue for 2017-18.Subsequently, a tripartite MoU was signed by the railway ministry, IRCON and RLDA on March 26, 2018 for transfer of leasehold rights of the land parcel. IRCON agreed to provide the upfront lease premium of Rs 2,700 crore to Rs 3,200 crore in lieu of being provided the transfer of leasehold rights for the project site and rights to undertake commercial development of the property by appointing a developer. The repayment of principal and interest was to be borne by the ministry.As per the report, RLDA and IRCON signed the 99 years’ lease agreement on March 28, 2018. However, the agreement was repudiated through a supplementary agreement on the same day stating that in view of the ongoing mutual discussion and that since the parties were examining the issue, “the grant of lease site is presently not required to be undertaken”.IRCON went ahead and borrowed Rs 3,200 crore from Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) at 8.77% interest rate and paid Rs 2,580.6 crore to RLDA on March 31, 2018. As per the terms of the MoU, railways paid the entire principal amount of Rs 3,200 crore along with interest of Rs 835 crore.The CAG in its audit found that the IRCON borrowed from IRFC despite the lease agreement being terminated. “Thus the Ministry of Railways received a lease premium for a parcel of land which was not on lease. While this was credited as non-fare revenue in FY 2017-18, it created a huge liability for repayment and finally MoR paid interest of Rs 834.72 crore.”The CAG has recommended fixing responsibility for the huge loss.","Railway ministry has suffered Rs 835 crore loss on interest paid on a loan of Rs 3,200 crore taken by its PSU, IRCON, for development of a land parcel at Bandra East in Mumbai.

'Opposition misleading Muslims ...': Govt defends proposed changes in Waqf Act; Congress links it to assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-misleading-muslims-govt-defends-proposed-changes-in-waqf-act-congress-links-it-to-assembly-elections/articleshow/112382525.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday witnessed sharp exchanges between the government and the opposition as Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to ""correct the wrongs done by the Congress in the past."" The government justified the proposed amendments and said it aimed to empower the marginalised groups within the Muslim community , but the opposition called the Bill ""discriminatory and arbitrary"" and linked it to the year-end assembly elections in some states.The Bill, which amends the Waqf Act, 1995, seeks to ""effectively address"" issues related to the powers of the State Waqf Boards, registration and survey of waqf properties and removal of encroachments. Rijiju also introduced a Bill to repeal the Mussalman Wakf Act, 1923. Its statement of objects and reasons stated that the colonial-era legislation has become outdated and inadequate for effective management of Waqf property in modern India.Introducing the Bill, Rijiju said ""It is my good fortune that being non-Muslim, I am getting opportunity to bring a Bill for welfare of Muslims."" The Bill was later referred to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) for wider consultations.The Union minister accused the opposition of misleading the Muslims and claimed that there were many within the opposition ranks who support the Bill but are silent due to their party's stand on the issue.""They (Opposition) are misleading Muslims. Till last night, Muslim delegations came to me. Many MPs have told me that the mafia has taken over Waqf boards. Some MPs have said that they support the bill but can't say it due to their political parties. I will not take anyone's name so that their political career is not ruined,"" Rijiju said.The Union minister asserted that the government had held multi-layered country-wide consultations before introducing the Bill.""We have held multi-layered country-wide consultations on this bill. All the backward Muslims and the chairman of the Waqf Boards of 19 states and UTs started the discussion. A discussion was held with common Muslims in 2023. At that time a meeting was held in Mumbai and suggestions were made as to what should be done to improve the State Waqf Board. In the Lucknow meeting, discussions were held with the top-level people of the UP State Waqf Board, and the views of the common people were also heard. They all said that this amendment is needed,"" Rijiju said.The Union minister asserted that no provision of the proposed Bill interfered with the freedom of any religion, nor did it violate any article of the Constitution.However, the opposition was not convinced as it called it a draconian law and a fundamental attack on the Constitution.Congress MP K C Venugopal accused the government of violating the right to freedom of religion and claimed the legislation was being brought with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls. He said people had taught the BJP a lesson -- in Lok Sabha polls -- for its divisive politics but the saffron party is continuing with the same, keeping in mind the upcoming assembly elections in states such as Maharashtra. ""It is a direct attack on freedom of religion ... Next you will go for Christians, then Jains,"" he said.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the Bill was being introduced to appease the BJP's hardcore supporters. ""What is the point of including non-Muslims in Waqf boards when this is not done in other religious bodies?"" Yadav asked.""The truth is that the BJP has brought this Bill to appease its hardcore supporters,"" the Kannauj MP said, adding that it was brought with an eye on the polls.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-Sharadchandra Pawar MP Supriya Sule said her party opposed the Bill as it was against a particular minority community. ""Look at what is happening in Bangladesh, there is so much pain. It is the moral duty of a country to protect minorities,"" she said.""The government should clarify the intent and the timing of the Bill. We object, withdraw this Bill. Let's discuss it and then bring a Bill that is fair and just,"" she demanded.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chairperson Asaduddin Owaisi claimed that the House did not have the competence to make the amendments. ""It is a grave attack on the basic structure of the Constitution as it violates the principle of judicial independence and separation of powers,"" he said. ""You are enemies of Muslims and this Bill is evidence of that,"" Owaisi said.However, Rijiju strongly refuted all opposition objections and justified the proposed amendments.The Union minister said in the earlier law, there was no provision to challenge or review the order or judgement of the tribunal. Now, provision was being made for verdicts to be challenged at higher courts, the minister said.""In our country, no law can be a super law and that can't be above the Constitution. However, in the 1995 Wakf Act, there are provisions that are above the provisions in the Constitution. Shouldn't that be changed?"" he asked.""The wrongs which you have done, now, we are correcting those,"" Rijiju said, hitting out at the Congress.To justify the need for reforms in old law, the Union minister cited cases when an entire village in Tamil Nadu was declared Waqf land . Similarly, the Surat municipal corporation headquarters was declared Waqf property, he said and asked how is this possible.(With inputs from agencies)","The government justified the proposed amendments and said it aimed to empower the marginalised groups within the Muslim community.

The move to ban water inside the Taj has come in for criticism from some quarters.Deepak Dan, president of the Tourist Guides Welfare Association, said: “Tourists cannot remain in the Taj Mahal without water during hot and humid weather. Instead of being vigilant, authorities are imposing restrictions on water bottles. The association opposes this move.” He added, “Multiple cases of tourists passing out due to adverse weather conditions have surfaced in the last three months. Without water, visitors, especially children and the elderly, will suffer. The decision will also present a bad image among foreign tourists.”ASI superintending archaeologist Rajkumar Patel assured that visitors would not face inconvenience. He said, “Staff stationed at the main mausoleum have been provided with small water bottles.”","Two members of a right-wing group were arrested for pouring Ganga water at the Taj Mahal, believing it to be a Shiva temple.
