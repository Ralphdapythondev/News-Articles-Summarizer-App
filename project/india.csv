The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will go for weekly movement of the stock from Punjab to other rice consuming states.In a recent meeting with Union food minister Parhlad Joshi, Punjab CM Bhagwant Singh Mann flagged how scarcity of rice storage capacity in the state was affecting the paddy procurement from mandis and leading to farmers’ resentment. Joshi had promised to evacuate the stocks and also procure the 120 lakh tonnes of paddy from the state.Joshi on Wednesday said, “We are committed to create space and evacuating surplus rice stocks from Punjab and Haryana is our highest priority. We have submitted a plan for evacuation of foodgrain from Punjab.” Officials said options are also being explored to store some of the surplus rice in the godowns meant for wheat storage in the state.So far 23 lakh tonne of paddy has been procured from Punjab during the current marketing season, which is nearly 38% less than the 37 lakh tonnes bought last year during the same period. Punjab is the biggest contributor to the central pool of food grains stock.Sources said the Centre has given the go ahead for creating 20 lakh tonnes of additional storage capacity under the Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee Scheme . They added that the state govt will soon float tenders for this purpose.Till Tuesday, the FCI and state govt agencies have purchased 63 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers mostly in Punjab, Haryana and Tamil Nadu.

NEW DELHI: Between 2015 and 2024, India allocated approximately 4.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent of its GDP to education, aligning with international benchmarks set by ' Education 2030 Framework for Action', which recommends that countries allocate 4-6 per cent of their GDP to education.A new series of reports from the Unesco Institute for Statistics on world education statistics revealed that India's government expenditure on education has fluctuated between 13.5 per cent and 17.2 per cent during the same period.This range aligns with the Education 2030 target, that encourages government s to allocate 15-20 per cent of their public expenditure to education.These reports provide a detailed analysis of global education investment trends, particularly in relation to achieving sustainable development goals (SDG), especially SDG 4, which focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education.India's investment in education has remained stable, consistent with international benchmarks and has been investing more than some of its neighbours in terms of both GDP percentage and government expenditure. In comparison with other Central and Southern Asian countries, India has invested more in terms of both GDP percentage and government expenditure, contrasting with the global trend of declining average investment in education.The report notes that while South Asian countries, including Nepal and Bhutan, allocate around 4-6 per cent of their GDP to education, nations like Afghanistan and Pakistan are falling behind in terms of both expenditure and resource allocation.The report highlighted that ""as a percentage of total expenditure, the world average is in decline. Central and Southern Asia countries invest more in comparison with investment in 2010s. A decline is noted in other regions"".In 2022, India's expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP among Central and Southern Asia is lower only to Bhutan (7.5 per cent ), Kazakhstan (7.2 per cent ), Maldives (4.7 per cent ), Tajikistan (5.7 per cent ) and Uzbekistan (5.2 per cent ). Compared to the whole of Asia, India's expenditure is higher than countries like China and Japan.Globally, the world average of public expenditure on education has seen a decline, from 13.2 per cent in 2010 to 12.5 per cent in 2020, with a notable decrease following Covid-19 pandemic.","India's government expenditure on education has fluctuated between 13.5 per cent and 17.2 per cent.

Protesters in Bangladesh have seiged the presidential palace, Banga Bhaban , demanding the resignation of President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The anti-discrimination Student Movement , which led the campaign to remove Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , held a rally at the central Shaheed Minar in Dhaka earlier on Tuesday, where they announced their 5-point demands, including the President's resignation.As the protesters marched towards Banga Bhaban at night, they were met with barricades set up by the army.The protesters gathered outside the palace, chanting slogans calling for the President's resignation. ""The President is a crony of Hasina's authoritarian government. He must resign immediately"", a protester said.Mohammed Shahabuddin, also known as Chuppu, is the 16th President of Bangladesh. He was elected unopposed in the 2023 presidential election, nominated by the Awami League. The Anti-discrimination Student Movement has called for the abolition of the 1972 constitution and the drafting of a new one that reflects the context of 2024.The students have also demanded the banning of the Awami League's student organisation, Bangladesh Chatra League , and the resignation of President Mohammed Shahabuddin . They have called for the elections held in 2014, 2018, and 2024 under Sheikh Hasina to be declared illegal and for the disqualification of the Members of Parliament who won these elections.Additionally, they have called for the announcement of a Proclamation of the Republic in line with the spirit of the July-August uprising.The protests, which began in July with students demanding an end to the quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations. As the protests intensified, Sheikh Hasina, 76, resigned as Bangladesh's Prime Minister on August 5 and fled to India. An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established, and on August 8, Yunus was sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government.","Protesters in Bangladesh have seiged the presidential palace, Banga Bhaban.

"Murder-for-hire: Friend or foe, no compromise on criminal activity, says US Ambassador Eric Garcetti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/well-be-satisfied-only-if-guilty-held-accountable-us-envoy-on-pannun-case/articleshow/114519339.cms,"Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. (Reuters)

In an exclusive interview to TOI, the US ambassador Garcetti says there’s too much at stake for both countries to not get this issue right. He also says that while the US is satisfied with the progress in the Indian probe so far, Washington will be satisfied ultimately only if accountability is ensured.

Days after US authorities announced charges against a former Indian government official, Vikash Yadav , for his alleged involvement in a murder-for-hire plot, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti told TOI in an exclusive interaction while American authorities are satisfied with progress in India’s probe into the case, Washington will be satisfied ultimately only if accountability is achieved.He said the US wants the guilty to be held accountable and not just an assurance that the crime won’t be repeated in the future.Garcetti said there’s no way the US can compromise on criminal activity, whether it comes from an enemy or a close friend. He didn’t comment on whether the US would pursue Yadav’s extradition, as he said extradition can take place only after he is arrested. The ambassador also said there’s too much at stake for India and the US to not get this case right. Asked about the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists in Canada, and the threats issued by them from the US soil, Garcetti said the US takes real threats seriously and cited strong counterterrorism cooperation with India, giving the example of the Tahawwur Rana , the Mumbai attacks accused against whom, he said, India and the US have built up an “airtight” extradition case.“We have said 2 things from the beginning. This sort of behaviour is unacceptable from any country to another country. Certainly, unacceptable to us as Americans. That’s a red line, coming from an enemy or a closest friend. That’s our first responsibility, no matter who they are or what they say, to draw a line that murder-for-hire is illegal, as it is in every country,” said Garcetti.“Second, we desire accountability. Not just say it won’t happen in the future but that those who were involved will be held accountable. That’s what our prosecutors are focused on. Our prosecutors are 100 percent not political. They exist in a different universe,” he added.While expressing satisfaction with the work done so far by the Indian commission of inquiry, the ambassador said the US expects India would have criminal accountability for anyone who would break the law. “We are very satisfied that a commission of inquiry was set up. The commission is going through a formal process, as we do on dozens of cases at any point in time. Every single day, the United States and India formally ask for evidence, do joint investigations, make arrests, extraditions. We expect the same here,’’ said Garcetti.On the Indian probe committee’s recent visit to the US, the ambassador said that in Washington, there were good, deep discussions, sharing of information. “We got good feedback from the Indian committee. Our law enforcement authorities were happy to share. But ultimately, I think, people in Washington will only be satisfied when accountability is achieved. Our prosecutors have put forward evidence that merits criminal charges and that evidence can and will be shared in a proper way with the Indian investigation and I’d expect that the Indian system, just like the American system, knows that murder-for-hire plots are illegal and will hold people accountable,” said the ambassador.Garcetti didn’t predict if US authorities would seek Yadav’s extradition, but when asked if the US expects India to arrest him, Garcetti reiterated that American authorities expect accountability. “And that can happen probably in more than one way. Without accountability, justice won’t be served. I can’t speak about this individual’s criminal activities here in India but the prosecutors in the US clearly believe he was involved in a criminal conspiracy in America,” he said.Asked about whether this issue might adversely impact the India-US relationship, given the speculation here that American authorities might be acting in tandem with the Canadians, the ambassador said, “that there’s too much at stake in our relationship for us not to get this right”.“There’s no way we can compromise criminal activity and the fundamental values that murder-for-hire is illegal and that crossing borders for international murder plots is against the law. Any country’s first responsibility is defending its people’s rights, whether it’s freedom of speech or the right not to get killed. But there’s too much at stake to not get this right. I’m optimistic that we can get this right. We are collaborating, even the most difficult conversations are happening. I am confident India and America can get it right but it won’t be simple,’’ he said.When asked about India’s concerns over the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists in Canada, or that Pannun could issue threats to India from the US soil, and how the US could held India address some of these issues, the ambassador cited close counter terrorism cooperation between the 2 countries, and cited the example of how they had dealt with the case involving Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana.“I’m very proud of the work we are doing together in counterterrorism. We always tell our Indian friends to focus on crimes. And when we focus on crimes, as opposed to opinions, we are able to see progress. When an Indian consulate is attacked, we launch a criminal investigation. We take the safety and security of Indian diplomats very seriously. We take terrorist acts, not words but acts, incredibly seriously. And threats on people’s lives is a crime in the US. Nobody is protected in the US against those sorts of criminal acts. For instance, in the Tahawwur Rana case, we have done everything the right way. We have worked closely together and that can result in a victory against terrorism for both India and the US as friends. We will continue to take real threats seriously,’’ said Garcetti.On whether Rana could be extradited soon, he said there’s only one step left which is appeal to the Supreme Court . “I’ll leave it to the legal experts, but everybody says this is airtight, done correctly and it would be very surprising if he were to make one more appeal. And by the way that appeal doesn’t guarantee anything. Every court has so far upheld the work that India and the US are doing together on this extradition,” he said.On charges against Yadav, Garcetti also said that in the American system, a politician or even the White House doesn’t pick up the phone and tell the prosecutor to bring charges or not. “That’s an independent decision based on the prosecutors’ belief in the evidence,” he said.Asked about India’s latest diplomatic spat with Canada over the “expulsion” of the Indian high commissioner, Garcetti described both as close friends and partners of the United States and expressed hope they can reach an understanding. “It’s something really between India and Canada. I’d hope there can be an understanding. Justice is justice. That should be clear. I think these are countries that cooperate on issues of criminal justice all the time and I’d hope that can be achieved even in difficult moments,’’ he said.","Garcetti said there’s no way the US can compromise on criminal activity, whether it comes from an enemy or a close friend. He said the US wants the guilty to be held accountable and not just an assurance that the crime won’t be repeated in the future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519429,imgsize-667260,width-400,resizemode-4/114519429.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing stalemate over seat-sharing arrangements in the Mahayuti alliance over at least four seats in Mumbai and adjoining areas, senior BJP functionaries, including Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Wednesday called on Union home minister Amit Shah to explore possible solutions.BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday after which Shiv Sena workers opposed BJP candidates in at least four seats, including Kalyan East , Thane, Navi Mumbai and Murbad.They have threatened not to campaign for BJP candidates in these constituencies, which could have a ripple effect in other constituencies in the region as well. In Kalyan East, BJP has fielded Sulabha Gaikwad, wife of sitting MLA Ganpat Gaikwad.Gaikwad is currently in jail for allegedly firing on Shiv Sena neta Mahesh Gaikwad inside a police station. Sena functionaries have opposed Sulabha Gaikwad's nomination since the beginning.Shiv Sena workers are also not happy with BJP's decision to field Sanjay Kelkar in Thane, who is considered Shiv Sena chief and CM Eknath Shinde's stronghold. Besides this, they are opposing the candidature of Ganesh Naik in Airoli in Navi Mumbai and Kishan Kathore in Murbad constituency.Sources said Sena leadership isn't ready to accede to BJP's decision of contesting the above seats and is contemplating fielding is own candidates, thus raising prospect of 'friendly fights', something which threatens to negate the advantage which the saffron alliance hoped to reap on account of the fight among rival Maha Vikas Aghadi partners.BJP sources, however, said the party brass would sort out the differences, and pointed out that allies, including NCP of Ajit Pawar, have reached a consensus on the majority of seats. Sources said BJP is likely to contest over 160 seats followed by Sena and NCP.Assembly elections in Maharashtra will take place in a single phase on Nov 20 and counting of votes will take place on November 23.","BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday.

Maha formula a setback for Congress, says party neta

MUMBAI: At a point when it appeared Maha Vikas Aghadi could be on the verge of collapse owing to lack of consensus over a seat-sharing formula for assembly polls, MVA's architect & NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar stepped in to draft an acceptable agreement.Following a meeting of MPCC president Nana Patole, UBT Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut, NCP (SP)'s Jayant Patil and CLP leader Balasaheb Thorat with Sharad Pawar, an understanding was reached on Wednesday evening over contesting 255 seats: Congress , NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies.There is still no call on 15 disputed seats - 3 in Mumbai & 12 in Vidarbha, but they will be distributed among MVA partners, sources said.UBT Sena’s Sanjay Raut said following Sharad Pawar’s intervention, the process of drafting the seat-sharing formula was expedited as most candidates were in favour of filing nomination papers on Thursday as it is being seen as an auspicious day. Raut initially said at a press meet that consensus had been reached on 270 seats. Later he said, “I had said 270 seats, but it was 255.”A senior Congress politician said the new formula is being seen as a major setback for Congress because on Tuesday, it had been informally agreed that Congress would contest 105 seats, NCP (SP) 84 and UBT Shiv Sena 95. “Since there was no end in sight to the negotiations, Congress decided to go some steps back and agreed on 85 seats. We are sure that we will improve on our Lok Sabha polls performance, and in addition, we expect to secure additional seats from the remaining 15,” the politician said.As it appeared that no agreement could be reached, state Congress functionaries knocked at the doors of AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, who summoned the Congress state functionaries to New Delhi for discussions.Kharge then deployed Congress legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat to call on both Sharad Pawar and UBT Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to resolve the dispute. Accordingly, Thorat had a brief meeting with both Pawar and Thackeray, but even then the dispute was not resolved, after which Congress netas felt that it was time to exit from MVA and contest the polls separately.NCP (SP) leadership took note of these developments and felt that if MVA does not contest elections jointly, Mahayuti is sure to retain power in the state. Pawar then spoke to Raut, Thorat and Thackeray and asked them to expedite matters and decide the seat-sharing formula on “as is where is” basis (meaning they should go ahead with what has been decided already) instead of discussing it on a seat-to-seat basis until the final seat is decided. However, notwithstanding Pawar’s words to the warring netas, the row over the 15 disputed seats remains unresolved.","Congress, NCP (SP) and UBT Sena would fight 85 each, while 18 seats would be left for smaller parties who are allies. There is still no call on 15 disputed seats - 3 in Mumbai & 12 in Vidarbha, but they will be distributed among MVA partners.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519478,imgsize-1394988,width-400,resizemode-4/114519478.jpg"

No joint statement, China talks of ‘important progress’, not ‘agreement’

The landmark agreement India and China reached this week to end one of the longest military standoffs in recent times received the final seal of approval on Wednesday from PM Modi and President Xi Jinping , as the two held a bilateral meeting in Kazan after a gap of five years and endorsed the deal. This, according to the Indian side, will lead to a further easing of the situation along LAC.As the next step forward, the two agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019, and underlined the need to take relations forward from a ""strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges"".The SRs - NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi - have met on several occasions on the sidelines of multilateral events, including last month in St Petersburg, but not under the SR talks format. According to an Indian readout, Modi welcomed the agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 in eastern Ladakh, which also led to the deadly Galwan clash that year, and underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquillity.Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that Modi also assured Xi of India's full support to China's SCO presidency in 2025. China described the meeting as constructive and one that carried great significance.China, however, did not use the word agreement in its readout, with the spokesperson only saying that Modi and Xi commended the “important progress” that had been reached through intensive communication on relevant issues in the border areas.There was no joint statement either on the border agreement or even on the Modi-Xi meeting.“We believe that the importance of India-China relations is not just for our people. Our relations are also important for global peace, stability and progress,’’ Modi told Xi in his opening remarks, adding he was looking forward to constructive talks with an open mind.He also mentioned the 3 mutuals — mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity — that India has often said should form the basis of bilateral ties. India had maintained for the past 5 years that ties could return to normal only through restoration of peace and tranquillity along the border.Xi also told Modi that it's important for both sides to have more communication and cooperation, to properly handle differences and disagreements, and to facilitate each other’s pursuit of development aspirations.“It’s important for both sides to shoulder our international responsibility, set an example for boosting the strength and unity of developing countries, and to contribute to promoting multi-polarisation and democracy in international relations,” said Xi.Xi also said in the meeting that “specific disagreements” should not be allowed to affect the overall relationship.The agreement reached this week pertained to Demchok and Depsang areas, the 2 friction points where disengagement had not been completed.The two agreed that the SRs will meet at an early date to oversee the management of peace and tranquillity in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question, according to the Indian readout. It added that relevant dialogue mechanisms at the level of foreign ministers and other officials will also be utilized to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations.","No joint statement, China talks of ‘important progress’, not ‘agreement’ The two agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519213,imgsize-1075412,width-400,resizemode-4/114519213.jpg"

SRINAGAR: PDP president Mehbooba Mufti reaffirmed Wednesday her stand that Union government should initiate dialogue with Pakistan , saying J&K is suffering due to hostility between two neighbours and only through reconciliation can peace and stability be achieved.This has been PDP’s stated position for long. In its assembly election manifesto, PDP advocated talks with Pakistan to address “unsettled Kashmir issue”.“People of J&K are stuck in animosity between two countries. Their lives and their property are getting destroyed because two countries are fighting each other. J&K is bearing brunt and poor non-local labourers are also suffering because of that,” Mehbooba said after visiting slain doctor Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s home in Nayidgam village of central Kashmir’s Budgam district.Dr Dar and six other employees of a tunnel-construction company were killed by suspected Pakistani terrorists at their campsite on Srinagar-Leh highway in Ganderbal district Sunday evening. Other victims were architectural engineer Shashi Bhushan Abrol from Jammu, three workers from Bihar — Faheem Nasir, Mohammad Hanif, and Abdul Kaleem — along with Anil Shukla from Madhya Pradesh, and Gurmeet Singh from Punjab.Ex-CM Mehbooba, who headed a PDP-BJP govt from April 2016 to June 2018, criticised Centre’s stand on dialogue with Pakistan, pointing out that mixed messages from govt further delay peace process . She said until India and Pakistan engage in meaningful dialogue, similar to peace efforts initiated during former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure, situation would only worsen.Her remarks stand in contrast with NC president Farooq Abdullah’s rhetoric after Ganderbal massacre that there can be no talks till Pakistan stops killings. Mehbooba refused comments on Abdullah’s remarks. “Every person in J&K, not just Mehbooba Mufti, wants this violence to end and that two countries sit together and talk so that we get out of this bloodshed,” she said.",Mehbooba Mufti reaffirmed her stand that Union government should initiate dialogue with Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Vikash Yadav , a former government employee now in the centre of a legal and diplomatic storm, is being made a ""scapegoat"" in international politics, said his lawyers, R K Handoo and Aditya Chaudhary.Handoo denied allegations from the US Department of Justice that Yadav had allegedly conspired to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , emphasising that Yadav has never gone to the US.""Our client was not involved in any criminal activity. He has done nothing wrong. The accusations are baseless and part of a larger international conspiracy against India,"" said Handoo.Claiming their client was innocent and was being framed, Handoo and Chaudhary said Yadav didn't even know Nikhil Gupta , his alleged co-conspirator. The US has alleged that Yadav (aka CC1) directed the assassination plot from India, providing sensitive information about Pannun to Gupta, who in turn shared it with a 'hitman' who was an undercover DEA informant. Gupta was extradited to the US from Czech Republic in June this year. He was dramatically arrested there last year at the request of the US govt.Since last summer, Yadav's life has been turned upside down. The whole episode has taken a severe toll on his personal life.After being dismissed from service, he was forced to vacate his government accommodation in a humiliating manner, Handoo revealed. ""His reputation is in tatters, and he faces a constant threat to his life. The psychological pressure has been relentless. He was subjected to mental harassment in the custody of Delhi Police ,"" Handoo told TOI.As the case unfolds, tension between India and the US over the issue persists. The FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant for Yadav, and he remains 'at large'.

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has approached the Hyderabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) against his mother YS Vijayamma and sister YS Sharmila , urging it to cancel the July 6, 2024, transfer of shares of Saraswati Power and Industries Private Ltd in favour of his mother.Jagan has fallen out with his mother and sister after Sharmila's political foray in Andhra Pradesh.A bench of judicial member Rajeev Bharadwaj and technical member Sanjay Puri issued notices to Vijayamma, Sharmila, Saraswati Power and also to the Registrar of Companies in Telangana and other respondents, asking them to file their replies to Jagan's petition. The bench adjourned the case to November 8 for further hearing.After his YSR Congress Party swept to power in AP in 2019, Jagan had promised his mother and sister that he would transfer some of the shares in his companies to them. He along with his wife Bharathi then registered a gift deed to this effect.Jagan said the MoU which he entered into with his mother and sister with good intention will not remain in force since they disturbed the goodwill and sought nullification of the share transfer done in favour of his mother. ""To prove that my MoU and gift deeds are real, I transferred all the shares of Sandur Power to Vijayamma in June 2021 as a goodwill gesture,"" he claimed.Later, a gift deed was executed stating that the shares of Saraswati Power too would be transferred after clearance from courts in theED cases , Jagan explained. But with Sharmila making political forays into AP as a rival to him, Jagan said it caused him distress. Stating that there was no goodwill, he conveyed his intent to nullify the MoU and gift deeds.""The transfer of shares in Saraswati Power was done behind my back,"" Jagan said, questioning the decision of the authorities in effecting such transfer without the beneficiaries producing any share certificates of the companies that were facing ED cases. The case, which was listed in NCLT on September 10, was filed under section 59 of Companies Act, which deals with rectification of the register of members.Claiming that his mother and sister had broken this trust by transferring the shares of Saraswati Power in their favour without informing him, Jagan sought directions to the ROC to restore the shareholding pattern to the previous pattern. Jagan maintained that the transfer of shares was not lawfully permissible because the company was facing ED cases and that there was a restraint order from the high court.""Unless all these cases are cleared, no lawful transfer of shares is possible,"" he contended in his petition before NCLT. ""Even the discreet transfer of shares effected by my mother and sister is also illegal,"" the ex-CM said and sought a direction from NCLT to this effect.Jagan further asserted that his late father, former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy, settled all the property issues during his lifetime and the current assets were a result of his hard work and effort. Conveying his changed mind, Jagan said the gift deed that he executed was a mere manifestation of the intent and not the actual transfer of shares.","Andhra Pradesh former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has approached the Hyderabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) against his mother YS Vijayamma and sister YS Sharmila.

PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday rejected a plea to recall its order of Jan 11, 2024, consolidating all suits filed in connection with the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute at Mathura.Dismissing the plea moved by the Shahi Idgah mosque side, Justice Mayank Kumar Jain said consolidating all suits would save the precious time of court and the expenses of litigants.Further, it would ensure smooth hearing and expeditious disposal, and help to avoid conflicting orders and decisions in different suits, the judge said. Justice Jain had reserved his order on Oct 16 after hearing all sides.The high court's decision means the Jan order would remain intact, allowing for a unified legal process for all the 18 cases concerning the disputed land, which holds religious significance for both Hindus and Muslims.Earlier, moving the application on behalf of the Muslim side , Tasneem Ahmadi, a Supreme Court lawyer, had submitted that consolidation of all cases would deprive them of the right to oppose each case. Besides, it had been done at a premature stage, she said, contending that the cases should not be consolidated before framing of issues and collecting evidence.Opposing the application, Hari Shankar Jain from the Hindu side submitted that consolidating the cases came under the court's discretionary power, and neither of the parties had the right to challenge the same. The only purpose of such an objection was to delay the proceedings, Jain contended. He also submitted that consolidation did not mean losing the right to contest all the cases.","Allahabad high court rejects plea to recall its order of Jan 11, 2024, consolidating all suits filed in connection with the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi- Shahi Idgah dispute at Mathura.

SC judge's dissent: Only Parliament can regulate industrial alcohol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-judges-dissent-only-parliament-can-regulate-industrial-alcohol/articleshow/114521157.cms,"Justice Nagarathna disagreed on overruling the 1989 judgment by a seven-judge bench led by her father and then CJI ES Venkataramiah. (Agencies)

NEW DELHI: Justice B V Nagarathna on Wednesday penned a lengthy opinion to disagree on all but one issue with the eight other judges on a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud , and said Parliament alone is competent to exercise regulatory powers over industrial alcohol while state legislatures can do so for 'intoxicating liquor'.The majority opinion authored by CJI Chandrachud, with concurrence of seven judges, overruled the 1989 judgment in Synthetics and Chemicals case by a seven-judge bench led by Justice Nagarathna's father and then CJI E S Venkataramiah.Justice Nagarathna said the 1989 judgment merely needed a clarification, not overruling.Justice Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027. It will also mark the first time a daughter has followed her father to head the country's judiciary. She will be CJI for 37 days from Sep 24 to Oct 29, 2027. Her father was CJI for six months from June 19 to November 17, 1989.CJI Chandrachud, along with his father Justice Y V Chandrachud, who was CJI for the longest-ever tenure of seven-and-a-half years, are the first father-son duo to head the Indian judiciary. Chandrachud Jr has twice overruled his father's judgments - the infamous Emergency-era ADM Jabalpur verdict in the Aug 2017 K Puttaswamy case and the 1985 judgment upholding validity of adultery as an offence in the Joseph Shine judgment in Sep 2018.Justice Nagarathna agreed on one issue with the majority opinion, which said, ""Parliament does not have the legislative competence to enact a law taking control of the industry of intoxicating liquor covered by Entry 8 of List II in exercise of the power under Article 246 read with Entry 52 of List I.""Ending her agreement there, she said Synthetics and Chemicals judgment in respect of Section 18G of the Industrial Development and Regulation Act (IRDA) correctly stated the law. ""Even with regard to 'industrial alcohol' as a product which falls within 'fermentation industries' in respect of which the Union has assumed control, in the absence of a notified order, the competence of the state to act under Entry 33 List III is denuded,"" she said.Justice Nagarathna said merely because 'industrial alcohol' can be easily manufactured into or misused to prepare 'intoxicating liquor', it would not grant states the competence to wholly regulate 'industrial alcohol'.""State legislatures only have legislative competence over what is 'intoxicating liquor' as a beverage. Therefore, the judgment in Synthetics and Chemicals is good law and was most correct in postulating that state legislatures will only have the competence to prevent misuse in interest of public health,"" she said.","Justice B V Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027. It will also mark the first time a daughter has followed her father to head the country's judiciary.

SC hands legislative control over molasses, grains to states

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday further expanded the scope of fiscal federalism by enabling states to exercise virtually complete legislative control over liquor production and trade, a ruling that will empower them to tax industrial alcohol , including denatured spirit and extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which were hitherto part of the sole domain of the Union govt.This ruling by a 9-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud , by eight to one majority, is the second financial bonanza for states in 3 months as the same nine-judge bench had, on July 25, entitled states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and levy tax on mineral bearing lands retrospectively from 2005, casting huge financial burden on central PSUs engaged in mining activities.On Wednesday, the judgment giving wider meaning to Entry 8 (intoxicating liquor) of State List and restricting the operation of Entry 52 (control of industries in public interest) of Central List followed the same ratio as in the July 25 mineral case ruling — CJI Chandrachud authoring the majority 123-page judgment for himself and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih and Justice B V Nagarathna penning an elaborate 241-page dissent.Importantly, the majority opinion interpreted the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’, which is solely within the legislative purview of states, to include extra-neutral alcohol (ENA), which is produced from sugarcane molasses or grains and used in industries producing alcoholic beverages, pharmaceutics, perfumery and hand sanitiser. Centre had cited production of hand sanitiser during the Covid pandemic to urge the SC to maintain parliamentary control over ENA.The SC went to the extent of giving legislative control over sugarcane molasses and grains, which are raw material for production of alcohol, to states. It said, “Entry 8 cannot be interpreted to exclude raw material used for the production of intoxicating liquor merely because the entry does not expressly provide for them. On an application of the principle that entries ought to be interpreted widely, the raw material for the production and manufacture of intoxicating liquor, as interpreted in this judgment, will be covered by Entry 8.“Parliament under Entry 52 of List I does not have the legislative competence to enact a law taking control of the industry of intoxicating liquor. State legislatures will have control over the industry of ‘intoxicating liquor’. Parliament could not have taken control of the field covered by Entry 8 since we have interpreted intoxicating liquor to include alcohol other than potable alcohol as well.”",Ruling by a 9-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud is the second financial bonanza for states in 3 months. The same bench had entitled states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and levy tax on mineral bearing lands retrospectively from 2005.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114521097,imgsize-445523,width-400,resizemode-4/114521097.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of provisions against dowry harassment by implicating various relatives of the husband along with main accused, SC said that ""exaggerated versions"" are reflected in a large number of complaints filed in such cases and urged courts to be careful while proceeding in such cases and protect the innocent from unnecessary sufferings.Acquitting a person in a dowry death case, a bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar said he got married to the sister-in-law of the deceased after the allegation of dowry harassment was first made and he could not be convicted just because his wife was found guilty.The issue of misuse of the provision has been flagged by the apex court and various high courts in their various judgements.They held that general and omnibus allegations could not be a ground for prosecution and asked the courts to be cautious in dealing with such complaints.Referring to an earlier verdict of the apex court, the bench said, ""This Court observed that it is a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints and the tendency of over implication is also reflected in a large number of cases"".""We are of the view that in view of such circumstances, the courts have to be careful to identify instances of over implication and to avert the suffering of ignominy and inexpiable consequences, by such persons,"" the bench said.The court noted that the accused got married to the sister of the main accused (husband) in Oct 2010 and the unfortunate incident resulting in her death occurred hardly within five and half months since he became a relative of the family.""It is a fact that despite the general, vague allegation no specific accusation was raised against the appellant. That apart, despite our microscopic examination, we could not find any specific evidence brought out by the prosecution against the appellant herein through anyone of the witnesses.In other words, the fact discernible from the impugned judgment is that none of the prosecution witnesses had specifically deposed against the appellant herein of his having committed any cruelty which will attract the offence under Section 498-A , IPC, against him,"" it said.""There is also no case that no complaints were filed implicating the appellant earlier to the subject FIR. In short, we find that there is no scintilla of evidence against the appellant herein to hold that he has committed the offence under Section 498-A, IPC... Being the husband of the second accused, who was found guilty by the courts below for the aforesaid offence cannot be a ground to hold the appellant guilty under the said offence in the absence of any specific material on record,"" it said.",Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar said he got married to the sister-in-law of the deceased after the allegation of dowry harassment was first made.
