Medicos reluctant to seek help: NMC survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medicos-reluctant-to-seek-help-nmc-survey/articleshow/112553121.cms,"NEW DELHI: An online survey carried out by National Medical Commission (NMC) which found a worrying percentage of UG and PG medical students reporting mental health issues , also found lack of access to mental health services and substantial reluctance to seek help .According to the survey report, released by NMC task force, accessibility of mental health services at medical colleges was rated as very or somewhat inaccessible by 3,648 (19%) UG students and the quality of these services was perceived as very poor or poor by 4,808 (19%).Among the PG students, the survey results reveal nearly 41% of the respondents felt uncomfortable in seeking help. On examining the landscape of seeking mental health assistance, experts note, most (44%) students avoided seeking help due to confidentiality concerns, highlighting the pervasive fear of privacy breaches and its deterrent effect on seeking help.Stigma was another significant barrier, with 20% respondents expressing fear of societal judgment and misunderstanding of mental health issues. Additionally, 16% of PG students cited unspecified challenges, indicative of various obstacles not explicitly categorised. Furthermore, concerns about the impact on future job prospects (9%) and licensing issues (1%) demonstrate the intricate interplay between mental health-seeking behaviours and professional livelihoods.""If these are the concerns faced by future healthcare professionals themselves, their potential in influencing patients to seek help becomes a question that needs to be thought through,"" NMC task force says.The task force has recommended implementing the Tele Mental Health Assistance and Networking Across States (Tele-MANAS) initiative in all medical colleges to provide a 24x7 support system across the campus. It has also suggested that resident doctors work no more than 74 hours per week, and no more than 24 hours at a stretch.The schedule includes one day off per week, one 24-hour duty, and 10-hour shifts for the remaining five days. ""Excessive duty hours pose risks to physical and mental health of medical students and also compromise patient safety,"" the task force headed by Dr Suresh Bada Math, a professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS Bangalore, says.Dr B N Gangadhar, NMC chairman, in his message shared with the report, adds: ""...medical students face immense stress and challenges that often go unrecognised.

Can't rely only on generalised probe report: ITAT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-rely-only-on-generalised-probe-report-itat/articleshow/112552770.cms,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled that additions to a taxpayer 's income cannot be justified solely bas-ed on a generalised report provided by investigation wing . According to tax experts, there are several rulings by the ITAT that have frowned upon the blind acceptance of generalised reports by I-T officers.In this case, during the financial year 2013-14, taxpayer P Jain had earned long-term capital gains of nearly Rs 60 lakh on sale of 32,000 shares of Moryo Industries.He claimed long-term capital gains exemption under section 10 (38) of the Income-tax (I-T) Act.For this particular financial year, long-term capital gains on sale of equity shares were fully exempt from tax.However, the I-T officer later reopened the assessment, based on information that another person was allegedly providing bogus long-term capital gains through accommodation entries.Based on this information, and the report from the investigation wing, the income tax officer concluded that the long-term capital gain declared by the taxpayer was fraudulent.Even though the I-T officer did not find fault with any documents furnished by the taxpayer evidencing the purchase and subsequent sale of shares, he treated the entire sale proceeds of Rs 63-odd lakh as the taxpayer's income. While Commissioner (Appeals) ruled in favour of the taxpayer, the litigation reached the doors of the ITAT.The ITAT observed that the taxpayer had purchased these shares in physical form, transferred them to his name and later dematerialised the shares. Subsequently, the shares were sold. The entire transaction, including the purchase and sale of the shares, was conducted through proper banking channels, and demat statements provided the requisite evidence.The ITAT upheld the decision of the Commissioner (Appeals). The tax tribunal bench held that the I-T officer had not conducted any independent investigation into the transactions and had solely relied on the generalized report from the investigation wing.","The Mumbai bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled that additions to a taxpayer's income cannot be justified solely bas-ed on a generalised report provided by investigation wing.

These low-cost and effective unmanned aerial vehicles fly at a certain altitude, loiter around its target with explosive charges and detonate the explosives once they hit the target. They are controlled from a command centre.The 30HP Wankel engine in these drones allows them to carry 100-120kg weight, which includes 30-40 kg of explosives. NAL is a constituent of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which was established in 1959 and is the only govt aerospace R&D laboratory in the country's civilian sector.The concept of kamikaze mission originated from World War II when Japanese pilots would ram their planes into Allied Forces’ assets, sacrificing themselves to inflict maximum damage. The modern Kamikaze drones, however, are unmanned, remotely controlled and have a precision strike.NAL’s Kamikaze drone is approximately 2.8 metres in length with a wingspan of 3.5 metres. These drones can also be deployed in swarms, overwhelming enemy defences and radars. One of the key features of these drones is their ability to operate in GPS-denied environments. Equipped with Isro-developed navigation system NaVIC, these drones can navigate and acquire targets even in areas where GPS signals are jammed.The Indian Army has currently inducted and deployed tiny Kamikaze drones called ‘Hoverbee’ in counter-terror operations in border areas that have been built by a Bengaluru-based startup. Though it neutralises threats with precision, its explosives-carrying capacity is less as compared to 30kg for NAL's Kamikaze drones. Once deployed, these new drones will add to the punching power of the security forces.","India's elite research institute National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has developed a desi ‘Kamikaze’ drone that is driven by an indigenously-built engine that gives them a range of 1,000 km.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

BJP Leader Suvendu Adhikari alleges TMC involvement

Nationwide protests and CBI probe

In the early hours of Thursday morning, chaos erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after a group of miscreants broke through barricades, manhandled protesting doctors, and damaged hospital property, including the emergency building where the body of a woman doctor was found last week, according to police reports.The incident occurred during midnight protests by women outraged over the horrific rape and murder of the doctor at the hospital.The vandalism took place as 'Reclaim the Nights' protest rallies—organized to demand justice for the brutal rape and murder of a young PGT doctor—converged at the hospital from various parts of the city.Police reported that a group of nearly 40 people, allegedly disguised as protesters, entered the hospital premises, vandalized property, and pelted stones at police officers, prompting the police to fire teargas to disperse the mob. Emergency beds occupied by patients were also vandalized, forcing doctors, nurses, and police officers to flee. The intruders, who were dressed in shorts and vests, were not part of the initial rallies.In addition to the damage to the hospital, a police vehicle and several two-wheelers were also vandalized, with some police officers injured in the violence.The 'Reclaim the Night' campaign, which gained momentum through social media, began at 11:55 pm, coinciding with Independence Day celebrations, and spread across key areas in both small towns and big cities, including several landmarks in Kolkata.As tensions escalated, Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal arrived at the scene around 2 am and criticized the media for what he called a malicious campaign against the police.Commissioner Goyal defended the actions of the Kolkata Police, saying they had left no stone unturned in the investigation. He asserted that even the CBI would not be able to prove that the police were trying to shield anyone.""What has happened here is the result of a wrong media campaign, a malicious campaign against Kolkata police. What has Kolkata police not done? We have done everything in this case... We have tried to satisfy the family, but rumors are being spread... I am extremely angry. We have not done anything wrong. Because of this malicious campaign, Kolkata police have lost the trust of the people. We have never claimed that there is only one suspect; we are waiting for scientific evidence, and it takes time... I can't arrest a young PG student based on rumors—it's against my conscience. There is immense pressure from the media, but we have acted appropriately. Now, the CBI is investigating. They'll conduct a fair probe, and we will fully support them... False propaganda is circulating that bones are broken, this is done, that is done, but unfortunately, it's not supported by scientific evidence,"" Goyal said.He further said, ""Please don't spread the rumours. We are verifying everything... We are constantly interrogating everyone who was there. On the first night, the additional CP was here and he had interrogated everyone personally. Just by rumour-mongering and bringing distrust to the citizens, I think this city is the loser, not Vineet Goyal... You must ask CBI, the kind of work the officers have done in the span of these four days and the city has given them this, this is demoralising for them.""Trinamool MP and Mamata Banerjee's nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, condemned the vandalism at RG Kar Medical College, saying it had crossed all acceptable limits. ""The hooliganism and vandalism at RG Kar tonight have exceeded all acceptable limits. As a public representative, I just spoke with @CPKolkata, urging him to ensure that every individual responsible for today’s violence is identified, held accountable, and made to face the law within the next 24 hours, regardless of their political affiliations. The demands of the protesting doctors are fair and justified. This is the minimum they should expect from the government. Their safety and security must be prioritized,"" Abhishek posted on X.BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, alleged that the vandalism was orchestrated by ""TMC goons"" sent by Mamata Banerjee. ""Mamata Banerjee has sent her TMC goons to the apolitical protest rally near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She thinks that she is the most shrewd person in the world and that people won't figure out the cunning plan of her goons, disguised as protesters, mixing with the crowd and carrying out vandalism inside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,"" Adhikari said in a post on X.Adhikari also alleged that the miscreants were given safe passage by the police. ""They were given safe passage by the police, who either ran away or looked the other way so that these thugs could enter the hospital premises and destroy areas containing crucial evidence so that it doesn't get picked up by the CBI,"" he claimed.The horrific rape and murder of the on-duty doctor have sent shockwaves across the nation, sparking silent protests, candlelight marches, and 'Reclaim the Night' rallies in several parts of the country. Doctors' associations are demanding assurances of minimum security in their workplaces.The semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found on the morning of August 9 in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata.Amid the ongoing tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the tragedy, the investigation into the heinous crime has been handed over to the CBI. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has assured full support to the CBI, emphasizing the need to solve the case at the earliest.Kolkata Police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy has been arrested in connection with the case. However, doctors, citing autopsy report findings, believe that more than one person was involved in the assault and murder of the doctor.The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the transfer of the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).","Violence erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning.

The party has planned road blockades from 2pm to 4pm in Kolkata and the districts. BJP also announced a two-hour ceasework at all state govt establishments.Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar alleged a complete collapse of law and order in the state and demanded CM Banerjee's resignation. He also announced a candlelight march near the CM's residence in Kolkata.CPM announced a two-day agitation beginning Friday, while SUCI called for a 12-hour bandh from 6am. CPM's Sujan Chakraborty alleged the vandalism had ""the hand of the CM,"" while fellow party functionary Bikash Ranjan said: ""Trinamool has orchestrated both the crime and the attack by miscreants yesterday.""CPM also demanded the arrest of former RG Kar college principal Sandip Ghosh, who has been accused of trying to ""cover-up"" the crime.BJP MLA and opposition leader in assembly Suvendu Adhikari has written to home minister Amit Shah, requesting the deployment of paramilitary forces at RG Kar hospital. Adhikari alleged that the vandals aimed to destroy evidence, particularly now that CBI has taken over the investigation into the doctor's death.These opposition protests will coincide with TMC's planned march, demanding capital punishment for the accused and condemning what it claimed are opposition attempts to discredit the CM. TMC maintained that the protestors at the hospital were not students but ""outsider politicians"" trying to stoke unrest in the state. The march led by the CM will start at 3pm in Kolkata.Anticipating widespread disruptions, the state govt has issued a notification warning that absence from work, unless pre-approved or due to medical emergencies or family bereavements, will be treated as a ""break in service"".Speaking to reporters on Thursday, CM Banerjee addressed the vandalism: ""I don't blame students. Some outsider politicians are trying to foment trouble in Bengal. This is a BJP-Left collusion... A DCP who was trying to protect people had gone missing for several minutes till he was found unconscious. Police were attacked, and yet they had shown extreme patience.

"PM Modi doubles down: Time for ‘secular civil code’, one poll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-doubles-down-time-for-secular-civil-code-one-poll/articleshow/112552024.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday asserted that there will be no let-up in his govt’s core agenda despite fewer seats in Lok Sabha and flagged the intent to move towards a “secular civil code” to replace a “communal civil code”, hold simultaneous elections and stick to the reform agenda, without diluting the “war against corruption” which he said he has waged at “considerable personal cost”.Modi’s 11th Independence-Day address from the Red Fort, was also his longest, running into 98 minutes.Invoking the Supreme Court ’s judgments and the exhortations to bring in the UCC desired by the framers of the Constitution, Modi said, “Numerous orders have been issued, reflecting the belief of a significant portion of our population — and rightly so — that the current Civil Code resembles a Communal Civil Code, one that is discriminatory. As we celebrate 75 years of the Constitution, we must hold extensive discussions on this subject as SC advocates for this change... Laws that divide our nation based on religion and foster discrimination have no place in modern society.”This was arguably the first-ever advocacy for the UCC from the Red Fort and appeared more significant because of BJP’s dependence on allies like TDP and JD(U) who had earlier diverged with the saffron party on its core agenda. Framing the current scheme of minority communities being allowed to have their personal laws as a communal one, the PM showed his intent to take on the opposition despited reduced numbers.The PM also used his 11th I-Day address — a feat managed only by the first PM Jawaharlal Nehru so far — to attack the opposition on a range of issues, from safety of women, a reference to the rape in West Bengal, to dynastic politics and efforts to create “anarchy”. He also sent a strong message to Bangladesh over ensuring the safety of Hindus.Modi, sporting his now trademark I-Day turban, sought to stick to the overall theme of building a developed nation and vowed to “triple the effort” in his third term and work “24x7” for achieving the ambition by 2047.He did not announce new schemes. Instead, the speech was laced with instances showcasing his govt’s achievements over the last 10 years – from cleaning up bank balance sheets to electricity in every village, building modern infrastructure and steps towards ease of living – while arguing that the results of the changes, including faster economic growth and doubling of per capita income, confirmed that the moves were “in the right direction”.Although the central message was that the govt was “here to serve each one of you, every family and every region” through 100% saturation of schemes, the PM repeatedly referred to the focus on Dalits, tribals, women, youth and farmers — constituencies that the opposition is targeting to corner a greater share of the voting pie.But marking a departure from his and his predecessor’s Independence Day speeches, Modi sought to address BJP’s core constituency on UCC, amid expectations that the party would put it on the backburner due to post-election coalition compulsions.With BJP-governed Uttarakhand having already enacted UCC and other states too moving in that direction, Modi’s comments could be a pointer to a central law or a model legislation, which will have to be tactfully manoeuvred.Similarly, he flagged another priority of ‘One Nation One Election’, arguing that frequent polls were creating obstacles to progress, again something which defied the popular assumption that a reduced tally would force him to put on hold a few of his favourite ideas which have been opposed by others.Advocating another electoral change, while slamming dynastic politics and casteism, Modi suggested that one lakh young persons without any political links should join parties. “Initially, we want to bring forward one lakh young people whose families have no political background — those whose parents, siblings, uncles, aunts have never been involved in politics, in any generation. We want fresh blood, one lakh such talented young people, whether they come into the panchayat, municipal corporations, district councils, state assemblies, or Lok Sabha.”Without referring to the opposition, he said that there was a section that did not appreciate the changes that the country was undergoing and cautioned that they could stall progress.“There are those who cannot think beyond their own welfare and do not care about the well-being of others. Such individuals, with their distorted mindset, are a concern. The country must avoid these people, who are mired in despair. When a handful of such individuals, consumed by their own negativity, spread this kind of toxicity, it leads to anarchy, destruction, chaos, and severe setbacks that necessitate immense efforts to rectify. These pessimistic elements are not merely hopeless; they are nurturing a negative mindset that dreams of destruction and seeks to undermine our collective progress.”","Modi’s 11th Independence-Day address from the Red Fort, was also his longest, running into 98 minutes.

And added that such a situation would create a diplomatically ""embarrassing situation"" for New Delhi.Hossain, however said that New Delhi ""knows this and I am sure they will take care of it"", the Reuters report said.The foreign adviser to the interim government earlier this week on Monday, said the neighboring country's relationship with India won’t be affected even if deposed PM Sheikh Hasina remains New Delhi’s guest for an extended period of time.“Bilateral relations are a much larger issue. Friendship is based on mutual interest,” Hossain said. “We will… always strive to maintain our good relations (with India),” Hossain said after a meeting foreign diplomats in Dhaka on Monday.However, Hossain had said Yunus is ""very unhappy about the way the statements are coming from India from the former prime minister” and reiterated that he had conveyed this to the Indian envoy in a meeting on Wednesday.The Indian side, who welcomed her on a ""temporary stay"" also has left the onus on the ousted leader to take the call on future plans. Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India's ministry of external affairs recently said that the Centre had little to do with Hasina's plans. ""We don't have an update on her plans. It is for her to take things forward,"" he said.Sheikh Hasina along with other Awami League members, faces charges in two murder cases in Bangladesh. Ataur Rahman, deputy director of the International Crimes Tribunal's investigation cell announced a third case involving ten people, including Hasina, who are being investigated for murder, torture, and genocide related to the protests .After Hasina's fleeing from Dhaka, protesters targeted the residences of her party leaders, attacking people and monuments linked to the Awami League. Reports indicate that several party leaders were brutally assaulted and killed by enraged crowds.Three of Hasina's former ministers and advisers have been detained in Bangladesh.However, in her only statement since her departure, Hasina has called for an investigation into the violence and destruction during the protests but has not addressed the allegations against her.The leader's son Sajeeb Wazed also mentioned that Hasina would not return to politics in Bangladesh and that her flight from the country and resignation were influenced by her family's repeated pleas.( with input from agency)","Mohammad Touhid Hossain, the de facto foreign minister, said that the ousted leader was now facing “numerous cases,” while stopping short of speculating more.

"Post-Paris adrenaline rush: Neeraj, Manu strike gold with brand deals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-paris-adrenaline-rush-neeraj-manu-strike-gold-with-brand-deals/articleshow/112552059.cms,"TOI

MUMBAI: The brand value of India’s Olympics stars Neeraj Chopra and Manu Bhaker has soared after they scored big in Paris with companies making a beeline seeking to tap into their popularity to connect with a wider audience. Hockey goalkeeper P R Sreejesh, shuttler Lakshya Sen and shooter Arjun Babuta too are seeing interest from companies.Chopra’s brand value has seen an appreciation of 40-50% after the mega sporting event in which he bagged a silver, his second successive medal at the Olympics, said industry sources.The Ambala boy’s endorsement fees were already at a premium, estimated at Rs 4 crore annually per brand.Already endorsing a raft of products across 21 categories, including sports lifestyle, audio and smartphones, he is now being approached by more brands across segments – from automobiles to financial services, real estate, logistics and quick commerce, Divyanshu Singh, COO at JSW Sports which manages Chopra’s portfolio toldChopra’s team is in advanced talks with at least 10-15 brands. “Neeraj Chopra is India’s single biggest Olympian. Besides Olympics, his consistent victories across Asian Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games make him India’s greatest athlete ever. Brands cannot only leverage his widespread reach across platforms but also tap into his Indian and global appeal,” said Singh, adding that they are expecting to close a few deals in the coming weeks.With two bronze medals to her credit, shooter Bhaker’s fees have jumped six to seven times per deal — from around Rs 20-25 lakh per endorsement that she charged before the Olympics, said Neerav Tomar, MD at IOS Sports and Entertainment which manages her.The “new kid on the block” is set to sign a deal with KFC and is already endorsing Thums Up and Performax, among others. Bhaker’s team has received enquiries from over 50 brands. “Currently, we are focusing on securing long-term association deals and we expect to finalise at least 5-6 endorsements in the near term. Given the increased interest and the elevated fees, the combined deal value is expected to run into crores,” said Tomar.“Her marketability has skyrocketed, with many brands valuing her as a symbol of youth, determination and excellence, making her one of the most sought-after athletes in India right now,” added Tomar.Veteran Sreejesh, who announced his retirement, too is being courted by companies. Sreejesh, who already had digital associations with brands like Cadbury, Jio Cinema and Thums Up and multi-year associations with Alpha Hockey Sticks and Obo Helmets has seen a 20-30% increase in his brand value, said Tuhin Mishra, co-founder and MD at Baseline Ventures, which manages him and few other Olympians including Lakshya Sen and Arjun Babuta.Sreejesh recently struck a deal with food delivery major Zomato. Fashioned more in the form of a celebratory campaign, it’s a multi-platform association which gives the company the usage rights to the athlete’s image, run print ads to celebrate his success among others.Lakshya Sen and Arjun Babuta, although they finished fourth, have seen their brand appeal get a boost post-Paris games. Sen’s brand value has seen a jump of 40-50% while for Babuta, there is a 15-20% growth, said Mishra. “Babuta is seeing more digital deals currently. For Sen and Sreejesh, we are seeing both digital and brand ambassador deals,” said Mishra.There is a definite shift happening from India being a cricketing nation to a multi-sport nation, said Darshana Bhalla, CEO and founder at D’Artist Talent Ventures. “Medals at the Olympics and Asian Games widens our thought process when it comes to multi-sports, a cultural shift. This is how the economics of sports actually will grow,” said Bhalla.While new athletes grab all the brand attention, brand value of big sports personalities like P V Sindhu are unlikely to erode anytime soon, said experts. “Champions don’t get eroded. Has Sachin Tendulkar’s brand value eroded or will Roger Federer start getting paid less? For champions of epic level, the residue brand value also stays for a very long period of time,” added Bhalla.","Chopra’s brand value has seen an appreciation of 40-50% after the mega sporting event.

On Viksit Bharat

If 140 crore citizens of my country, 140 crores of my family members set out with a resolution, determine a direction and march forward step by step, shoulder to shoulder, no matter how great the challenges, how intense the scarcity or the struggle for resources, we can overcome every challenge and build a prosperous Bharat and achieve the goal of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.

We must not let this opportunity slip away. If we seize this moment and move forward with our dreams and resolutions, we will fulfil the nation 's aspirations for a 'Swarnim Bharat' (Golden India) and achieve our goal of a developed Bharat by 2047.

's aspirations for a 'Swarnim Bharat' (Golden India) and achieve our goal of a developed Bharat by 2047. A new and modern system is being established in every field, be it the tourism sector, MSMEs, education, healthcare, transport, agriculture, or the farming sector.

We aim to advance in line with our country’s unique conditions while adopting the best practices from around the world.

Every sector requires modernization and innovation, with an emphasis on integrating technology.

Less government interference in the lives of ordinary citizens is an important part of our vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.

At least two annual reforms in each of the 3 lakh institutions operating across the country are mandated, then it could result in around 25-30 lakh reforms annually leading to increased confidence of common man.

On hurdles facing India

In today’s India, there is no place for a Mai-Baap culture.

There is a certain section of people who cannot think beyond their own welfare and do not care about the well-being of others. Such individuals, with their distorted mindset, are a concern. The country must avoid these people, who are mired in despair.

These pessimistic elements are not merely hopeless; they are nurturing a negative mindset that dreams of destruction and seeks to undermine our collective progress. The country needs to recognize this threat.

Corruption at all levels has shattered the common man’s faith in the system.

I want to create an environment of fear for the corrupt, so the tradition of looting the common citizen comes to an end. The attempt to sow such seeds in society, the glorification of corruption, and the continuous efforts to increase the acceptance of the corrupt have become a significant challenge for a healthy society and a matter of great concern.

Dynastic politics and casteism are causing significant harm to the democracy of Bharat.

On defence

We are becoming self-reliant in the defence sector.

India has gradually emerged and is establishing itself as an exporter and manufacturer of various Defence Equipment.

When our armed forces conduct Surgical Strikes, our heart fills with pride and our heads are held high.

140 crore Indians today feel proud and confident of episodes of valour of our armed forces.

On financial sector, economy

We have successfully doubled the per capita income of individuals.

We have made significant strides in setting new records in employment and self-employment

Multiple reforms were implemented to strengthen the banking sector. And today, as a result, our banks have secured their place among the selected strong banks in the world.

Strong banking system becomes the greatest strength to meet the needs of the common poor, especially middle-class families.

Banks are the biggest support for our MSMEs.

Various under-privileged sections of society like the cattle-rearers, fishermen, street vendors are now connecting with banks and are achieving new heights, and becoming partners in the path to development .

. Numerous financial policies are being continuously developed to advance the nation and the country's trust in these new systems is steadily growing.

If there was any country that has swiftly improved its economy amidst the global covid pandemic, it is Bharat.

Development of modern infrastructure & Ease of Living should be focused to catapult our economic growth and development.

In the past decade, we have witnessed humongous infrastructure development by providing state of art railways, airport, ports, and robust roadways network to ensure government connectivity.

I urge all elected representatives, regardless of party or state, to take steps on a mission mode to ensure Ease of Living.

India is bound to become the third-largest economy during my third term, and that I will work three times harder, at three times the speed and with three times the scale so that the dreams we have for the nation are realized sooner.

On farmers

Transformation in the agriculture sector is the crucial need of the hour.

I am grateful to all the farmers who have chosen the path of natural farming and taken a resolve to serve our Mother Earth.

Substantial schemes with significant provisions were introduced in this year’s budget to promote and support organic farming.

We must strengthen the nutrition of the world and also support the small farmers of India.

India and her farmers have the potential to create a global food basket of organic food.

60,000 ‘Amrit Sarovars’ (ponds) have been revived and replenished.

On world affairs

G-20 was never held in such a grand manner before.

Bharat has the capability to organize major international events and possesses unparalleled hospitality.

External challenges, in particular, are likely to escalate.

I want to convey to such forces that the development of Bharat does not mean a threat to anyone.

We are the land of Buddha, and war is not our path. Therefore, the world need not worry.

I hope that the situation in Bangladesh soon returns to normalcy, especially given our proximity as a neighbouring country.

The primary concern of our 140 crore citizens is to ensure the safety of Hindus, the minorities in Bangladesh.

Bharat has always desired that our neighbouring countries pursue a path of contentment and peace.

Our commitment to peace is deeply rooted in our culture.

On empowerment and development



We chose the path of reforms to bring about change in the lives of the poor, the middle class, the underprivileged, our growing urban population, the dreams and resolutions of the youth & their aspirations.

When political leadership is determined to bring empowerment and is resolute towards development, then the government machinery also starts enabling and ensuring robust implementations.

When every citizen starts participating actively towards ensuring empowerment and development, then the outcomes are bound to be valuable for the nation.

Last mile connectivity has ensured every village and even forest zones get a school, modern hospitals and Arogya mandirs are built in faraway geographies to provide affordable healthcare to the marginalised through Ayushman Bharat schemes.

When the mantra of saturation is embraced, the true essence of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"" is realized.

When we lift 25 crore people out of poverty, it reinforces our belief that we have maintained our momentum, and our dreams will soon be fulfilled.

When my specially-abled brothers and sisters start communicating in the Indian sign language, or benefit from the campaign of inclusive and accessible nation through Sugamya Bharat, s/he feels respected and enjoys dignity as a citizen of the country.

It is amazing to see our sportspersons come out in flying colors in Paralympics.

Equitable decisions with high sensitivity towards our ostracized transgender society were undertaken by bringing amendments and introducing new laws for their incursion into the mainstream and ensuring dignity, respect and equality for all.

We have embarked onto the ‘Trividh Marg’ (three-way route) and are seeing a direct benefit of the spirit of service to all.

It is our duty to make every effort to include the neglected regions, the marginalized communities, our small farmers, tribal brothers and sisters in the forests, our mothers and sisters, our laborers, and our workers, ensuring they are uplifted and empowered.

On education

75,000 new seats will be introduced in the medical sector in the next 5 years.

Through the new education policy, we want to transform the current education system in line with the requirements of the 21st century.

We will revive the spirit of ancient Nalanda University, positioning India as a global education hub by promoting higher learning and research.

We have to prepare future ready skilled resources in India to meet the expectations of the fast-paced development.

We want to develop an education system so that the youth of our country don’t need to go abroad. Our middle-class families need not spend lakhs and crores of rupees. Not only that, we also want to create such institutions that attract people from abroad to come to Bharat instead.

India’s talent should not be hindered because of language. The strength of the mother tongue empowers even the poorest child in our country to fulfil their dreams.

‘National Research Foundation’ was created, providing it with a legal framework to develop a permanent system that continuously strengthens research.

It is a matter of great pride that we have decided to allocate one lakh crore rupees for research and innovation in the Budget so that the ideas of our country’s youth can be realized.

On women safety, empowerment



10 crore women have become a part of women self-help groups in the last decade.

Women become guarantors and custodians of social transformation when they are financially empowered.

One crore mothers and sisters joined women self-help groups and are becoming ‘lakhpati didis’.

Funds allocated to women self-help groups will be increased from 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs.

Till date, a total of nine lakh crore funds has been channeled via banks to these self-help groups.

The paid maternity leave was extended from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for working women by our Government.

Women are taking on leadership roles. Today, in many areas—be it our defence sector, the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or our space sector—we are witnessing the strength and capabilities of our women.

As a society we should seriously dwell upon the atrocities being meted out to our mother, sisters and daughters.

Crimes against women should be investigated without any delay. Those committing such demonic acts must be booked prima facie to reinstate the trust on the government, judiciary and civil society.

The need of the hour is that there should be a wide discussion about the criminals who get punished so that even those who commit such sins fear the consequences including hanging to death. I feel that it is very important to create this fear.

On developing industry

“Vocal for Local” has become a new mantra for economic development.

“One District One Product” is the new wave now.

Bharat will become an industrial manufacturing hub and the world will look up to it.

We must embrace the call of ""Design in India"" and move forward with the dream of ""Design in India and Design for the World.""

State governments should establish clear policies to attract investments, offer assurances of good governance, and ensure confidence in the law-and-order situation.

India's commits to become a global leader in semiconductor production

India must leverage its rich ancient legacy and literature to come up with Made in India gaming products.

Indian professionals must lead the global gaming market, not just in playing but also in producing games.

Indian standards should aspire to become international benchmarks.

Bharat's contribution to global growth is substantial, our exports are continuously rising, our foreign exchange reserves have doubled, and global institutions have increasingly placed their trust in Bharat.

We are proud that our toy industry has also become a name to reckon with in the global market. We have started exporting toys.

There was a time when mobile phones were being imported, but today India has a large hub of manufacturing ecosystem of mobile phones and we have started exporting them all over the world. Such is the prowess of India.

On railways

Government is committed to make its railways a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030.

On renewable energy

India has achieved more in the renewable energy sector than G 20 Nations collectively.

India is working hard to become self-reliant in the energy sector.

The PM Surya Ghar Free Electricity Scheme is set to provide new strength, and its benefits will be felt by the average families in our country, particularly the middle class, when their electricity bills become free. Those who generate electricity from solar energy under the PM Surya Ghar Yojana, can also reduce their fuel costs.

The demand for electric vehicles is on the rise.

On sports

The aim is to train India's youth and become the skill capital of the world.

1 lakh youth should be inducted into the political system, specifically those with no history of politics in their families.

Given the challenges of sustaining an entire family on small plots of land, we are making comprehensive efforts to equip the youth with the skills needed to secure new jobs and create additional sources of income.

On behalf of 140 crore fellow countrymen, I extend my congratulations to all the athletes and players of our nation who represented India in the Paris Olympics.

I also convey my heartfelt best wishes to all our Paralympic athletes.

Our goal is clear: to host the 2036 Olympics on Indian soil. We are preparing for this and making significant progress towards it.

On law and justice

The current Civil Code resembles a Communal Civil Code, one that is discriminatory.

Laws that divide our nation based on religion and foster discrimination have no place in modern society.

After 75 years of a Communal Civil Code, it is crucial to move towards a Secular Civil Code.

It is our collective responsibility to realize the vision of the framers of our Constitution.

We should welcome diverse opinions and perspectives regarding the secular civil code.

India should come forward to embrace the concept of ""One Nation One Election"".

Over 1,500 laws were eliminated to ensure citizens are not trapped in a web of legal complexities.

We have replaced the centuries-old criminal laws with new criminal laws known as Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, whose idea at core is to ensure justice for citizens as against British ideology of reprimand and punishment.

On skill development

Government is actively taking steps to promote the skill development of our youngsters.

We have earmarked a huge fund in this year’s Budget for Skill India Programme.

Internships for youth, emphasized in this budget, helps gain experience, build their capacity and showcase their skills in the market.

Bharat’s skilled manpower will make their mark in the global job market. We are moving forward with that dream.

On housing

Four crore pukka homes have given a new lease of life to the poor.

Three crore new homes have been promised in an effort to further this national agenda.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for seating Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , in the ""fifth row"" during the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort, labeling it as a display of ""pettiness"" and a disregard for democratic norms.Gandhi was observed sitting behind several rows occupied by members of the Indian contingent from the recently concluded Paris Games.It was for the first time in a decade that a Leader of the Opposition was present at Red Fort for the Independence Day celebrations.As per several media reports, officials of the ministry of defence, which organises the event, said the seating was arranged ""according to the table of precedence"", with the decision made to honor ""Paris Olympics medal winners"" as special guests this year.The front rows were occupied by Olympic medallists such as Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh. Members of the Olympic-bronze-winning hockey team, including its captain Harmanpreet Singh and PR Sreejesh, were also seated ahead of Rahul Gandhi.As per protocol, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, whose rank is equivalent to that of a Cabinet Minister, is always assigned a seat in the front row. The front row was occupied by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Amit Shah and S Jaishankar.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate asserted that PM Modi exhibits a ""petty mindset"", consistently revealing this aspect of his character.""It is pointless to expect significant actions from small-minded individuals. Modi's decision to place Rahul Gandhi in the fifth row during the Independence Day event reflects his frustration, but it does not deter Gandhi from addressing the people's concerns,"" she stated in a video on X.""However, this act underscores a lack of respect for democracy, democratic traditions, and the Leader of the Opposition,"" she added.Shrinate emphasised that the Leader of the Opposition holds a rank equivalent to a cabinet minister, while government ministers occupied the front row.""Not only was Rahul Gandhi relegated to the fifth row, but Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was also assigned to the same row,"" she noted.She criticized the defense ministry's justification for the seating arrangement , which claimed it was intended to honor Olympians, questioning why prominent leaders like Amit Shah, J P Nadda, S Jaishankar, and Nirmala Sitharaman were not also recognized.""The Leader of the Opposition is crucial for holding the government accountable and voicing public issues,"" Shrinate stated.""These individuals with a petty mindset disregard democracy and its traditions,"" she alleged.She further claimed that Modi and his ministers are uneasy with Gandhi's inquiries.""Whether Rahul Gandhi is seated in the fifth row or the fiftieth, he will always be a leader for the people. When will you cease these disgraceful actions?"" she remarked on X.Congress leader Vivek Tankha echoed this sentiment, questioning Modi's pettiness in a post on X, emphasizing that the Leader of the Opposition should be seated higher than any cabinet minister.","Gandhi was observed sitting behind several rows occupied by members of the Indian contingent from the recently concluded Paris Games.

While making his pitch for the capital punishment, PM referred to anger and frustration among women over continuing brutalities against them. ""Today, from the Red Fort, I once again express my pain. As a society, we will have to think seriously about the atrocities against our mothers, sisters, and daughters. There is anger among common people because of this. I can feel that rage,"" he said.The PM also stressed the need to amplify not just the news and discussion on the crime but also cases of punishment to ensure deterrence. He said, ""When a person of such demonic tendency is punished, it does not make headlines.

"States’ mineral windfall to easily surpass 1.5 lakh crore, Odisha’s share over 1 lakh crore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-mineral-windfall-to-easily-surpass-1-5-lakh-crore-odishas-share-over-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/112552164.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odisha stands to recover more than Rs 1 lakh crore in pending dues as several states across India are set for major financial gains following Supreme Court’s recent ruling that permits the retrospective collection of taxes on mineral-bearing land from April 1, 2005.Taking Odisha’s dues into account, the total arrears for the mineral-rich states since 2005 are likely to be much higher than the industry estimate of about Rs 1.5 lakh crore.This estimate includes the financial implications for both public sector undertakings (Rs 70,000 crore) and private industries.Starting in April 2026, Odisha will receive the pending dues in instalments over 12 years. Additionally, the state will collect an annual tax of around Rs 12,000 crore under the Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio-Economic Development (ORISED) Act, 2004, according to govt sources.Odisha introduced ORISED Act in Feb 2005, but it was struck down by Orissa high court later that year. SC’s recent verdict overturned the HC decision. The law allows Odisha to levy up to 20% of the annual value of mineral-bearing land. Tata Steel, in a July 31 exchange filing, disclosed it would owe Rs 17,300 crore in mineral tax to Odisha under SC’s ruling.Andhra Pradesh, facing a financial crunch, also expects benefits from the top court’s ruling. The state anticipates recovering between Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore in dues, with instalments starting in April 2026. A senior official from the mines and geology department said: “We are still making the assessment.”Telangana is likely to gain about Rs 300 crore in additional revenue through cess and royalty on mineral-bearing land. State govt plans to expand the list of taxable minerals, focusing on limestone, granite, and barytes.Mineral-rich states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Rajasthan are still determining the extent of the financial windfall. Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s economic adviser Basavaraj Rayareddy expected the estimates to reach several thousand crores of rupees.Jharkhand will recalibrate its tax claims from April 2005 onwards, after the ruling invalidated previous demands stretching back to 1993. “We have to re-calculate our demand,” said Jharkhand Mineral Area Development Authority managing director Ravi Raj Sharma. The new calculations, minus interest and penalties, are expected to total less than the original Rs 1,000 crore sought.According to Madhya Pradesh mineral resources department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar Shukla, it’s too early to suggest a figure. “The state will benefit from the order. The amount of royalty and tax will be calculated in the coming days.”(inputs from Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Ranchi, Bengaluru, Bhopal)","Odisha stands to recover more than Rs 1 lakh crore in pending dues as several states across India are set for major financial gains.

‘Mental health issues in 28% of UG medicos’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mental-health-issues-in-28-of-ug-medicos/articleshow/112552113.cms,"NEW DELHI: An online survey carried out by National Medical Commission ( NMC ) says 28% of undergraduate medical students and 15% of post-graduate medical students have mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression.The survey, carried out by a task force constituted by NMC following multiple suicides reported among medical students in the recent past, found that nearly 16% of the UG students and 31% PG students reported having thought about suicide.In all, 25,590 UG students, 5,337 PG students, and 7,035 faculty members from medical colleges across the country participated in the survey.According to the survey report, released by the NMC task force, accessibility of mental health services for students at medical colleges was rated as very or somewhat inaccessible by 3,648 (19%) UG students and the quality of these services was perceived as very poor or poor by 4,808 (19%).Among the PG students, the survey results reveal nearly 41% of the respondents felt uncomfortable in seeking help. On examining the landscape of seeking mental health assistance, the experts note, most (44%) students avoided seeking help due to confidentiality concerns, highlighting the pervasive fear of privacy breaches and its deterrent effect on seeking help.Stigma was another significant barrier, with 20% respondents expressing fear of societal judgment and misunderstanding of mental health issues. Additionally, 16% of PG students cited unspecified challenges, indicative of various obstacles not explicitly categorised. Furthermore, concerns about the impact on future job prospects (9%) and licensing issues (1%) demonstrate the intricate interplay between mental health-seeking behaviours and professional livelihoods.“If these are the concerns faced by future healthcare professionals themselves, their potential in influencing patients to seek help becomes a question that needs to be thought through,” the NMC task force says.The task force has recommended implementing the Tele Mental Health Assistance and Networking Across States (Tele-MANAS) initiative of the health ministry in all medical colleges to provide a 24x7 support system across the campus. It has also suggested that resident doctors work no more than 74 hours per week, and no more than 24 hours at a stretch.The schedule includes one day off per week, one 24-hour duty, and 10-hour shifts for the remaining five days. “Excessive duty hours pose risks to the physical and mental health of medical students and also compromise patient safety,” the task force headed by Dr Suresh Bada Math, a professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS Bangalore, says.Dr B N Gangadhar, the NMC chairman, in his message shared with the report, adds: “…medical students face immense stress and challenges that often go unrecognised. The rigorous demands of medical education, coupled with the high expectations and pressures, place an extraordinary burden on their mental health. It is heart-wrenching to acknowledge that many of our brightest minds struggle silently, some even to the point of contemplating suicide. This is a reality we can no longer ignore.”","National Medical Commission ( NMC) says 28% of undergraduate medical students and 15% of post-graduate medical students have mental health disorders.

JDU, which is part of the NDA, has also favoured itIn an exclusive interview with ANI, Ajit Pawar said, ""I think caste census should be conducted for once.It should be conducted for once along with the general census because we will get to know the exact number of population of tribal, SCs, OBCs, minorities and other sections of society. It should be conducted because every section demands policies (reservation) for themselves, so, getting the exact figure can also help the government while making policies.""Emphasising the issues of farmers in Maharashtra, Deputy CM Pawar asserted that the government is working towards the welfare of farmers through various reforms such as giving loans at zero per cent interest rate, waiving farmers' old electricity bills and providing them free electricity.Listing out the three times when farmers' loans were waived off by the governments, Ajit Pawar said, ""Till now, around 3 times farmers' loans were waived. For the first time, it was on the national level during former PM Manmohan Singh Ji's tenure when P Chidambaram was finance minister and Sharad Pawar was agriculture minister. For the second time, in the state, when Devendra Fadnavis was chief minister, he waived off the farmer loans and for the third time when Uddhav Thackeray was CM, then I was the finance minister and we waived off the farmers' loan.""""Now, according to the state government's policy, we have started giving loans to farmers at zero per cent interest rate, for which 50 per cent Central government pays and 50 per cent state government, which they need to repay after 1 year. Keeping in mind the same thing, we brought a policy to waive off their electricity bills,"" he added.Ajit Pawar further said, ""Before presenting the budget, I interacted with lots of people, especially from the rural society where they talked about their problems. There were farmers too. One thing that was in my mind was to waive the electricity bill of farmers, as some farmers, when unable to pay the bill, they try to commit suicide.""Meanwhile, Pawar also highlighted the government's constant efforts to bring water to the drought-affected areas of the state, whether Vidarbha or Marathwada.Speaking on the irrigation water management in the drought-affected areas of the state, especially Vidarbha and Marathwada, Pawar said, ""We have planned in the long term for areas which have suffered from famine in past years. We have brought water there through various plans. Our different lift irrigation schemes are on the way and now free electricity will help farmers of this region more. We have started several lift irrigation schemes and made barrages. Projects like the Nalganga-Wainganga River linking and Nar Par Girnar River linking will also help such areas. We have started linking various rivers and bringing water through tunnels. This is a long-term project, so, it takes time to show results.""Furthermore, Pawar highlighted the reasons behind flooding of cities like Pune and Mumbai and said that Pune due to its natural terrain and heavy rains faced such situations.Speaking on the city infrastructure issues, Pawar said, ""Everybody knows the history of Pune city. The Pune city is like a valley which is surrounded by several dams on the upper side of the hills. What happened this time is, that Pune city along with the upper parts (where dams are located) witnessed heavy rains and around 35, 000 cusecs of water were released from the dam, which led to the flooding. Similarly, in Mumbai which is a group of 7 islands, which faces ocean tides every 6 hours and there are concrete roads everywhere, so the situation is that we can't do anything on it. On the second day of flooding, the water level itself goes down in Mumbai. We have tried everything, even consulted the best IAS officers but can't do anything on it, as it is a natural problem.""Earlier in July, Maharashtra faced continuous rainfall which led to the flooding of several cities. Meanwhile, earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray claimed that the reason behind flash floods in Pune city is the riverfront development project.","Congress and some other opposition parties have been demanding a caste census.

We have never attacked any nation, but have come forward to help those in distress, no matter how they may have treated us in the past. Even today, there are elements who want to dominate other countries, and we need to remain vigilant,” he said.“India extends help to victims across the world. It is necessary to ensure that the situation is conducive at home and in other countries as well,” he said. Bhagwat also said constitutional discipline needs to be maintained in the country. “Situations are not always the same and can be detrimental at times. The country remains free if each man values freedom more than life,” he said.Last week, RSS sarkaryavaha (general secretary) Dattatreya Hosabale issued a statement on X that the govt needs to make every effort to ensure safety of minorities in Bangladesh and continued persecution of Hindus there was intolerable. As a friendly neighbour, India is trying to play an able role in Bangladesh.Hosabale, who was in Nagpur on Thursday, attended another flag hoisting ceremony at Hedgewar Smruti Mandir campus at Reshimbagh an hour later. Here, Ram Vaidya, joint coordinator of Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), the RSS’ foreign arm, was the chief guest.Responding to TOI’s query on the crisis faced by Hindus in Bangladesh, Vaidya said allowing refugees into India will be a decision of the govt. “What people of Bangladesh need at this juncture is moral and emotional support. This will help strengthen Hindus, who can stand united. Providing strength means a state of mind which makes them strong enough to face the situation. There are many friendly organisations in the country which are making efforts in this direction. Refugee camps are being set up, he said.Earlier at a meeting of RSS volunteers, Vaidya said the HSS works on spreading the Sangh ideology across the world. “RSS always had a global view. India extended help to needy countries during Covid-19 pandemic by offering vaccines. Students were evacuated during the Russian-Ukraine war. Then diplomats of four African nations sought help from an NGO, Seva International, to evacuate their stranded students from these countries,” he said.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said it's India's duty to ensure safety of Hindus traumatised by unrest and anarchy in neighbouring countries. “The govt should protect them from atrocities,” he said in his address to RSS workers after unfurling the tricolour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112551013,imgsize-1853790,width-400,resizemode-4/112551013.jpg"
