"Judicial officers get array of tax-free allowances, Supreme Court forces states to pay allowance arrears by summoning chief secretaries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judicial-officers-get-array-of-tax-free-allowances-supreme-court-forces-states-to-pay-allowance-arrears-by-summoning-chief-secretaries/articleshow/112851813.cms,"NEW DELHI: Judicial officers get an impressive array of tax-free allowances over and above their salaries and states agreed to pay up to four weeks' arrears of allowances to district court judges as per Second National Judicial Pay (SNJP) Commission after chief secretaries and finance secretaries of defaulting states were made to appear before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.If a judicial officer is tasked with additional charge, then she/he gets an additional allowance for that purpose. If the judicial officer has a higher degree, like LLM or equivalent against the required qualification of LLB, he/she gets three advance increments in his pay scale. An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000. There are around 23,000 judicial officers distributed unevenly in different states, where as many as 4.5 crore civil and criminal cases are pending. Of these 38% of cases are less than one year old.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra agreed to examine the grievance raised by judicial officers that states do not pay advance increment for higher qualification on promotion under assured career progression (ACP), if the increments had been paid once. This means, with every promotion, they would be getting three increments if they had a higher qualification, which the CJI-led bench said prima facie it finds to be legitimate.In addition to the usual allowances like - DA, HRA, medical allowance during service and after retirement, earned leave encashment, LTA, conveyance, telephone and mobile phone allowance, the judicial officers are entitled to hill area/tough location allowance.If they are posted in trouble torn/ militancy infested or border areas, they are entitled to a risk allowance. Nagaland said it was not paying risk allowance to judicial officers as it has disentitled civil servants from getting the same. Judicial officers of the state protested the withdrawal of this allowance and the SC asked the committee of the Gauhati HC to examine this grievance of the trial court judges.The judicial officers also get sumptuary allowance and children's education allowances which include hostel subsidy. The electricity and water consumed by them and their families at residence is also substantially subsidized by the govts. Interestingly, the domestic help/home orderly allowance given to them while serving as judicial officers gets extended to them beyond retirement.Apart from these, they get furniture and air conditioner allowance, newspaper and magazine allowance and even an allowance to stitch or buy the judicial robes. They are also entitled to a grant for shifting to another town on transfer and can encash earned leave up to 300 days on retirement.","An entry level judicial officer, as per SNJP, gets a monthly take home of around Rs 90,000.

"Can currency and medicine wrappers be in Braille, asks Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-currency-and-medicine-wrappers-be-in-braille-asks-scseeks-responses-from-centre-and-states-in-4-wks/articleshow/112851625.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Union and state govts whether currency notes and medicine strips be integrated with braille system to enable 100% visually impaired people not remain dependent on others to ascertain denominations of currency notes and expiry dates of medicines.On a PIL by 12-year-old 100% visually impaired whiz kid Medhansh Soni, filed through his mother Ramta Soni, a bench of Chief Justices D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra sought responses from the Centre and the states within four weeks.Medhansh, who won eight gold medals across diverse subjects – general knowledge, mathematics, science and English - in international Olympiads, has sought “guidelines for the implementation of Braille Integration System and to address the nuance of indirect or hostile discrimination against visually impaired persons.”.The petitioner said failure to enact a comprehensive braille integration system throughout institutions in India has significantly disadvantaged visually impaired individuals, rendering access to public information elusive. “As a result, a substantial segment of society is subjected to undue hardship and exclusion from vital resources and opportunities,” he said.Visual impairment significantly hinders normal functioning in human beings, especially in the participation & economic productivity domains, he said. “According to the National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey, almost 6.2 million People are blind in India. The prevalence of blindness varies by region and demography with rural areas having a rate that is 1.37 times higher than urban areas. But the problem is not that someone is blind, but it is the society which is acting blind towards the needs and problems of such blind people,” Soni said.“India being the biggest democracy of the world for more than 70 years it is sad to note that the country is lagging behind other nations in providing them adequate facility to live life with dignity and equal opportunity even though the advent of braille and other supportive technologies have provided some succor against loss of vision,” he said in the petition filed through Nishant Kumar.Among the difficulties faced by visually impaired persons, the petitioner listed some of them - difficulty in identifying currency notes, inability to read product labels and medicine management challenges in navigating public places, and barriers in accessing information. He said demonetization has resulted in reduction of currency note sizes making it doubly difficult for blind persons to ascertain the value of currency notes.","The Supreme Court asked the Union and state govts whether currency notes and medicine strips be integrated with braille system.

Is UPS a Step Backward?

The Central government has recently launched the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an alternative to the current National Pension System (NPS) for its employees. Scheduled for implementation in April 2025, this new scheme presents a significant choice for employees who joined after 2004. Should they remain with NPS or transition to the new UPS? Here’s a detailed comparison to assist you in making an informed decision.The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced in 2004 as a defined contribution scheme, replacing the Old Pension Scheme (OPS).Under NPS, employees contribute 10% of their salary, while the government contributes 14%. The corpus is invested in a mix of government securities, equities, and corporate bonds, similar to mutual funds. Upon retirement, 40% of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity.The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), on the other hand, offers a guaranteed pension of 50% of the average pay for the last 12 months for employees who have served for 25 years or more. The government’s contribution under UPS is set at 18.5%, with the employee's contribution remaining at 10%. Additionally, UPS includes a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000 for those who have worked for at least 10 years, along with a lump sum retirement benefit.The UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits. Here's a breakdown:Employees with at least 25 years of service will receive a guaranteed pension of 50% of their average basic pay.In case of an employee's death, their spouse will receive a family pension of 60% of the employee's pension.Employees with at least 10 years of service will receive a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month.Both the assured pension and family pension will be adjusted for inflation.Retirees under the UPS will receive Dearness Relief.Employees will receive a lump sum payment at retirement.One of the most significant advantages of UPS is the increased government contribution of 18.5%, compared to 14% under NPS. This boost in contribution is expected to result in a larger pension corpus, ensuring better financial security post-retirement.UPS guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the average salary over the last 12 months of service. This assurance makes UPS a safer option for risk-averse employees, particularly given the market volatility that can impact the returns on NPS investments.For employees with at least 10 years of service, UPS offers a minimum monthly payout of Rs 10,000, providing a safety net for lower-earning employees. Additionally, the scheme includes a lump sum payment at retirement, linked to the duration of service, offering further financial support.While UPS offers a guaranteed pension, it limits the potential for higher returns that NPS might offer through market-linked investments. Under NPS, employees can choose from various investment options, including up to 65% in government securities, 15% in equities, and the remainder in corporate bonds. However, these investments are subject to market risks, and the final pension amount may vary.In contrast, UPS protects employees from market fluctuations, providing a stable and predictable income stream in retirement. For many, especially those nearing retirement, this stability may outweigh the potential for higher returns under NPS.Some may argue that UPS represents a step back from the market-linked reforms introduced with NPS. However, UPS retains the core principle of a defined contribution scheme, with additional safeguards to ensure a minimum pension. It also addresses the growing demand for a guaranteed pension among government employees, without reverting to the unfunded liabilities of the Old Pension Scheme.","The Central government has recently launched the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an alternative to the current National Pension System (NPS) UPS offers a more secure retirement plan with guaranteed benefits.

"BRS leader K Kavitha walks out of jail after 5 months, says 'we are fighters'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-brs-leader-k-kavitha-walks-out-of-jail-on-bail-after-5-months/articleshow/112844181.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha walked out of jail on Tuesday night after the Supreme Court granted her bail in the Delhi excise policy case earlier today. The case has been under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).K Kavitha after her release spoke to reporters and said, ""I want to thank all of you.I became emotional after meeting my son, brother and husband today after almost 5 months. Only politics is responsible for this situation. The country knows that I was put in jail only because of politics, I did not make any mistake I will fight...""Kavitha said, ""We are fighters, we will fight it out legally and politically. They have only made the BRS and KCR's team unbreakable"".The apex court's bench, comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, ordered her immediate release on strict conditions, including the submission of her passport to the trial court and regular attendance at trial proceedings.Kavitha, who had been in custody for five months, was released after furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10 lakh each in both the CBI and ED cases. The court emphasized that she must not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses during the ongoing trial.""The appellant is directed to be forthwith released on bail in both cases. She shall not make any attempt to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses,"" the court ruled.During the hearing, the Supreme Court questioned the evidence presented by the CBI and ED against Kavitha. The bench noted that the investigation was complete, and the chargesheet had been filed, making her continued custody unnecessary. The court further stated that undertrial custody should not become a form of punishment, particularly when the trial's conclusion is unlikely to occur in the near future.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Kavitha, argued that the investigating agencies had already completed their investigation against her and drew parallels with the Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia, who is a co-accused in the same cases.However, the additional solicitor general, S V Raju, representing the investigating agencies, alleged that Kavitha had destroyed or formatted her mobile phone, which he claimed amounted to evidence tampering. Rohatgi dismissed the allegation as ""bogus.""The Supreme Court also addressed the Delhi High Court's earlier decision to deny Kavitha bail, describing the high court's reasoning that bail could not be granted simply because a woman is educated and independent as ""perverse"" and ordered it to be quashed.Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was arrested by the ED in Hyderabad on March 15 and by the CBI on April 11 while she was in Tihar jail. The high court had previously rejected her bail applications, citing her alleged involvement as a key conspirator in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.",BRS leader K Kavitha walked out of jail on Tuesday night after the Supreme Court granted her bail in the Delhi excise policy case earlier today.

'Stop this murderous game', says West Bengal governor

NEW DELHI: Kolkata and the adjacent Howrah witnessed large-scale violence on Tuesday as protests over the alleged rape and murder of a junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College turned into pitched battles between demonstrators and the police.The unrest began when protestors, aiming to march to the West Bengal state secretariat, Nabanna, were intercepted by police at multiple locations.The ensuing clashes, which lasted nearly four hours, saw protestors pelting stones and glass bottles, leading to injuries on both sides. Senior police officers and women protestors were among those hurt, with 15 personnel from Kolkata Police and 14 from the state police sustaining injuries. Over 200 people were arrested across the state.Here are the top developments in the case:Demonstrators faced a strong response from police on Tuesday during the 'Nabanna Abhijan' protest march in Howrah's Santragachi area. The police employed water cannons to disperse the protesters who were attempting to scale the barricades and engaged in confrontations with the officers on duty.The situation escalated as the demonstrators ""dragged away police barricades,"" prompting the authorities to resort to lathicharge and the use of tear gas shells to regain control. Heavy police had been deployed around the West Bengal state secretariat to maintain order and prevent any untoward incidents.In response to the police action, the BJP announced a 12-hour general strike in West Bengal on August 28. The strike is a protest against what the BJP described as the ""autocratic"" crackdown on peaceful demonstrators seeking justice for the deceased doctor.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar criticised chief minister Mamata Banerjee's government, accusing it of ignoring public outcry and failing to ensure the safety of women in the state. He condemned the police's use of batons, tear gas, and water cannons to disperse the crowd, who were demanding Banerjee's resignation.The CBI has intensified its probe into the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case, seeking court permission to conduct a polygraph test on Kolkata Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Anup Dutta. Dutta is suspected of having extended various favors to the accused, Sanjay Roy, and the CBI aims to uncover whether Roy confided in Dutta about the crime.To strengthen its investigation, the CBI will consult forensic experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) regarding the DNA and forensic evidence in the case. This step is crucial to confirm whether Sanjay Roy acted alone or if others were involved in the heinous crime. The CBI has been working on the premise that Roy was the sole perpetrator, but the involvement of others can only be ruled out after receiving expert opinions from AIIMS.The violent protests have further intensified the political battle between the BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The BJP has accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of protecting those involved in the crime and demanded her resignation to ensure a fair probe. The party also called for a polygraph test on Banerjee and Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goel, alleging a cover-up. On the other hand, the TMC hit back, accusing the BJP of orchestrating chaos and disrupting law and order in the state.West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose conveyed his distress regarding the turmoil that engulfed Kolkata's streets in the aftermath of the 'Nabanna Abhijan' protest rally on Tuesday. Bose described the scenes witnessed in the city as a ghastly sight.""I would say disproportionate force and coercive power were used by the state in dealing with the situation, ignoring the Supreme Court's pronouncements that state power shall not be unleashed against peaceful protesters. This is the ghastly sight that we saw today on the streets of Kolkata. Certainly, this cannot be appreciated in any manner,"" he said.Bose emphasised that the current state of affairs is far from normal, and all individuals involved in public life feel compelled to unite and confront the government's irresponsible actions, given the severity of the situation.","Kolkata and Howrah witnessed large-scale violence on Tuesday as protests over the alleged rape and murder of a junior doctor turned into pitched battles between demonstrators and the police.

NEW DELHI: India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US, which will add to the 72,400 such guns bought earlier for frontline Army troops, amid the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“The SiG-716 `Patrol’ rifles, which are 7.62x51mm caliber guns with an effective ‘kill’ range of 500-metre, are meant for infantry battalions deployed along the borders with China and Pakistan.It is a repeat order valued at Rs 837 crore,” a source told TOI on Tuesday.The delay in the manufacture of Russian AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles in India had led to the import of the first lot of 72,400 SiG-716 rifles (66,400 for the Army, 4,000 IAF and 2,000 Navy) under a Rs 647 crore contract inked with US firm SiG Sauer under the fast-track procurement route in Feb 2019.The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) had given the nod for the procurement for the additional 73,000 SiG-716 rifles in Dec last year. Parallelly, the Army is also buying 40,949 light machine guns, which were cleared by the DAC in Aug 2023 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,165 crore.On the assault rifles front, the first 35,000 Kalashnikov AK-203s were finally delivered to the Army earlier this year after being assembled at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP under the joint venture called Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited.In all, six lakh AK-203 rifles have to be manufactured at the Korwa factory over 10 years. These 7.62x39 mm caliber rifles, with an effective range of 300-metre, are supposed to cater to the overall needs of the over 11-lakh strong Army as well as the IAF and Navy.The AK-203 project was first announced in 2018 but was hit by huge delays due to costing, royalty, technology transfer, indigenisation level and other issues, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Army in the past has dismissed reports of glitches in the SiG-716 rifles, stressing that the US-origin rifles have “longer effective range, more lethality and higher recoil” as compared to the indigenous INSAS (5.56x51 mm) or AK-47 rifles.The Army says it has been using ammunition manufactured by Indian ordnance factories for the SiG-716 rifles. “The rifles are also fitted with Picatinny rails to facilitate mounting of various equipment and accessories, such as optical sights, UBGL (under-barrel grenade launchers), forehand grips, bipods and laser pointers, without any modifications,” an officer said.","India has now inked another contract for the import of an additional 73,000 SiG Sauer assault rifles from the US.

BJP alleges scam in land allocation to Kharge family trust; Siddaramaiah says 'done in accordance with law',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-has-become-synonymous-with-corruption-bjp-alleges-scam-in-land-allocation-to-kharge-family-trust-siddaramaiah-says-done-in-accordance-with-law/articleshow/112837691.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday accused Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's family of being involved in a ""scam"" related to the allocation of land to a trust run by his family in Karnataka. The party has called for a CBI investigation into the matter and petitioned the Karnataka governor to dismiss Priyank Kharge, Mallikarjun Kharge's son, from the state cabinet.The controversy revolves around the alleged allocation of five acres of land by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) to the Siddhartha Vihar Trust, run by the Kharge family, in the hi-tech Defence Aerospace Park near Bengaluru.The trust includes Mallikarjun Kharge, his wife Radhabai, son Priyank Kharge, son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and younger son Rahul Kharge.BJP's national spokesperson, Gaurav Bhatia, demanded the resignation of Mallikarjun Kharge as Congress president and Priyank Kharge as a Karnataka minister. He also called for Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah to step down.""There is a consistency in the Congress' acts of corruption. Wherever we will go we will do corruption is the new slogan of the Congress. It will not be wrong to say that the Congress has become synonymous with corruption,"" Bhatia said.Bhatia pointed to the alleged irregularities, stating, ""As per information with us, several companies and organisations had given applications for the land, but it was allocated to the Kharge family-run trust by flouting the rules."" He also referenced previous alleged scams under the Siddaramaiah government, including the MUDA and Valmiki Development Corporation scams.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defended the land allocation, stating, ""It has been done in accordance with law. Their trust is eligible, so we have done it."" He further questioned the BJP's previous decisions, asking, ""How did the BJP (while in power) allot the land for Chanakya University? We have done it in accordance with law.""Additionally, leader of opposition in the Karnataka legislative council, Chalavadi T Narayanaswamy, described the land allocation as a case of ""criminal breach of trust"" by the Kharge family towards fellow Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs. ""With utmost pain, I bring to your kind knowledge another case of nepotism of the Karnataka government,"" Narayanaswamy stated in a letter submitted to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot.Earlier today, speaking to reporters before meeting the governor, Narayanaswamy reiterated his stance, saying, ""It is clear to the naked eye that the land has been given to prominent and influential people.""Meanwhile, BJP leader and member of Rajya Sabha Lahar Singh Siroya on Sunday questioned the eligibility of the Kharge family to receive the KIADB land, asking, ""When did they become aerospace entrepreneurs to be eligible for the land?"" He further inquired whether the case involved misuse of power, nepotism, and conflict of interest.Reacting to these accusations, Priyank Kharge on Monday clarified that the site allocated to the trust is not meant for industrial or commercial purposes but for educational purposes. ""The intention of the trust is to set up a multi-skill development centre in the CA site,"" Priyank Kharge said, questioning, ""Is it wrong?""He said that there was no subsidy or subsidised rate for civic amenity plots allotted to SC/ST organizations and defended the trust's eligibility, stating, ""The trustees have a background of establishing and managing good quality and affordable education institutions."" Priyank Kharge further criticised the BJP, saying, ""BJP lacks basic common sense that CA sites are not allotted or auctioned; they have to be purchased as per KIADB and government guidelines."" He noted that only 43 organizations applied for 193 available sites, dismissing the allegations of nepotism and influence as ""baseless.""Priyank also pointed out that the previous BJP government had allocated lands to various institutions, including Prerana Trust, Chanakya University, and Rashtrotthana, questioning the legitimacy of those decisions.""Here we are purchasing a CA site, we have not sought any subsidy or deferred payment or anything illegal. What is illegal in this, I don't understand,"" Priyank said, accusing the BJP of politicising the issue by invoking the names of the chief minister and Mallikarjun Kharge.","The controversy revolves around the alleged allocation of five acres of land by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board to the Siddhartha Vihar Trust. The trust includes Mallikarjun Kharge's wife Radhabai, son Priyank Kharge, son- in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and younger son Rahul Kharge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112839352,imgsize-686874,width-400,resizemode-4/112839352.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said that the Navy , not the state government, was responsible for the construction of the 35-foot statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Sindhudurg district which collapsed on Monday.Fadnavis suggested that the makers of the statue may have failed to consider crucial local factors , such as high wind speed and the quality of the iron used, which could have made the statue more susceptible to rust due to its exposure to ocean winds.""The construction of the statue was not overseen by the state government but by the Navy. The individuals responsible for the fabrication and installation of the statue might have overlooked important local factors, such as high wind speed and the quality of the iron used. The statue might have become more prone to rust due to its exposure to ocean winds,"" Fadnavis said.""It is our resolve to build a bigger statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the same site,"" Fadnavis said. He also mentioned that an inquiry into the incident was ongoing.Responding to the opposition parties' criticism of the state government over the incident, Fadnavis said, ""The collapse of the statue is painful, but the opposition parties' stand on it is distasteful. There is no need to politicise the issue as it would be seen as shallow.""The opposition parties have accused the government of hastily installing the statue ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Following the collapse, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde attributed the incident to a wind speed of 45 km per hour. State Public Works Department (PWD) minister Ravindra Chavan revealed that PWD officials had noticed rust on the statue and had informed the Navy in writing.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray criticised the ruling BJP government, expressing disbelief that even the revered figure's monument could fall victim to alleged corruption within the BJP's ranks.""It is unimaginable that the statue of our deity, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would also be a subject of the BJP's corruption,"" Thackeray stated in his post.The opposition leader further accused the BJP of attempting to shift the blame onto the Indian Navy. He pointed out a pattern of favoritism towards certain contractors, subpar quality of work, and inaugurations timed to coincide with elections rather than genuine sentiment.",Devendra Fadnavis said the Navy was responsible for the construction of the statue.

BJP pins hope on Kolhan Tiger Champai to end poll drought in key Jharkhand region,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-pins-hope-on-kolhan-tiger-champai-to-end-poll-drought-in-key-jharkhand-region/articleshow/112847365.cms,"NEW DELHI: The entry of Champai Soren into BJP is likely to help it counter Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren 's attempt to polarise tribals against the party in the coming assembly polls .Although BJP boasts of two former tribal CMs Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda in its ranks, they never got much traction in the ST-dominated Kolhan region which has a history of producing local heroes and standing by them.Even Sibu Soren, founder of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and father of CM Hemant Soren, had to contend with the tenacious appeal of locals like Bagun Sambrai, Nirmal Mahto and Shailendra Mahto.Champai, Tiger of Kolhan to his supporters, is part of the trend, having carved out a loyal constituency because of his espousal of local causes, particularly his role in getting the youth jobs with TISCO and other enterprises in the area.BJP hopes to benefit from the association. It needs the boost considering that it drew a blank in the 14 seats in the Kolhan region in 2019 as well as in light of the success of Hemant Soren in turning his arrest by ED into a case of injustice to tribals in the Lok Sabha elections which saw the saffron party losing all the five seats reserved for tribals.Some of the BJP insiders went to the extent of saying Champai's joining is set to fetch the party at least eight to 10 seats in Kolhan, brightening its prospects in the state polls this year.Party sources said Soren is joining the party unconditionally, but they acknowledge his key role in the selection of candidates, especially in the Kolhan region, as he will also bring with him the legacy of JMM which he was associated with since the statehood agitation days, being one of the most trusted aides of party patriarch Sibu Soren.Even the JMM leadership seems to be worried about his imminent departure as the party has not taken action against Champai, who earlier expressed outrage over the JMM leadership, accusing it of humiliating him and forcing him to quit as chief minister unceremoniously.",Champai Soren is likely to help BJP counter Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren's attempt to polarise tribals against the party.

"BJP wins 9, allies 2 in RS bypolls for 12 seats; NDA hits majority mark for first time since 2014",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-wins-9-allies-2-in-rs-bypolls-for-12-seats-nda-hits-majority-mark-for-first-time-since-2014/articleshow/112846800.cms,"If nominations go BJP’s way, NDA’s RS tally can hit 123

NEW DELHI: The NDA reached the majority mark in Rajya Sabha on its own for the first time since it assumed office in 2014 with BJP winning nine seats and its allies two in bypolls to 12 seats in the latest round. All candidates were elected unopposed.BJP now has 96 seats in the House of 237, with eight seats - four in J&K and four in the nominated category - lying vacant.Along with allies and the support of six nominated and two Independent members, NDA has touched the majority mark of 119. With its improved tally, NDA can get any legislation passed without having to enlist the support of friendly non-NDA, non-UPA parties. In its last term, Modi govt had to depend on either YSRCP (11 members), BJD (8) or AIADMK (4) to get the required numbers in RS. NDA reaching the majority mark on its own is crucial given the uncertainties attached to YSRCP and BJD which have decided to side with the opposition this time.Since nominated members invariably go with the governing party, govt has one more window to increase its lead once it nominates four members to the vacant seats. In that case, NDA's tally with support of nominated and independent MPs will reach 123 - two more than the majority mark in the House of 241.Congress' Abhishek Manu Singhvi won the lone seat from Telangana unopposed, with the party reaching 27 in the Upper House - two more than what it needs to retain its leader of opposition post in Rajya Sabha. Before the bypolls, the party had 26 members, putting the fate of leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge hanging by a thread.In the bypolls, BJP won one seat each from Madhya Pradesh (George Kurian), Rajasthan (Ravneet Singh Bittu), Odisha (Mamata Mohanta), Tripura (Rajib Bhattacharjee), Maharashtra (Dhairyashil Patil), Bihar (Manan Kumar Mishra) and Haryana (Kiran Choudhry), and two from Assam (Rameswar Teli and Mission Ranjan Das) whereas its allies won one seat each from Bihar (Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Lok Manch) and Maharashtra (Nitin Patil of NCP).Ten of the 12 seats fell vacant as sitting BJP, Congress and RJD members from seven states were elected to Lok Sabha while one member each from Telangana and Odisha resigned and switched to other parties. In Telangana, BRS member K Keshava Rao resigned and joined Congress while in Odisha BJD's Mamata Mohanta resigned and joined BJP.","The NDA reached the majority mark in Rajya Sabha on its own for the first time since it assumed office in 2014.

"SC questions fairness of ED, CBI probe, gives Kavitha bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-fairness-of-ed-cbi-probe-gives-kavitha-bail/articleshow/112846750.cms,"'Be fair': SC says 2 others not being tried

NEW DELHI: In a relief to Bharat Rashtra Samithi's K Kavitha who has been in custody for the last five months in the Delhi excise policy case, Supreme Court Tuesday granted her bail in both corruption and money laundering cases, and put CBI and ED in the dock over its ""fairness"" and ""pick-and-choose"" approach in arresting accused in the case.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said the trial was not going to conclude soon and undertrial custody should not become a punishment for an accused.The bench also expressed strong disapproval of Delhi high court's order rejecting Kavitha's plea for bail as per Sec 45 of PMLA that makes a special case for bail for women, among other categories. The HC had said Kavitha being ""highly educated and accomplished"" could not be given benefit of the provision which was meant for a ""vulnerable woman"". SC said courts could not create a subcategory when the provision only mentioned 'woman'.After half-an-hour of hearing and after examining some of the evidence, the bench raised objections over the probe and told additional solicitor general S V Raju that if he continued to argue the case on behalf of the agencies, then it would have to pass a detailed order and would have to pass observations on the merits of the evidence which could affect trial proceedings. Reluctantly, the ASG relented. He agreed for bail to Kavitha and asked the court not to pass any remarks on the merits of the case, paving the way for the court to pass a brief order granting bail. The bench also clarified in its order that its observations would have no bearing on the merits of the case.Kavitha, daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, who was arrested by ED on March 15, is the third high profile accused after AAP leader Manish Sisodia and MP Sanjay Singh to come out of prison in the case. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal got bail in the PMLA case but his bail plea in the CBI case is pending in SC.The bench invoked the same principle applied in Sisodia’s case that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for bail in money laundering cases. The court noted that the probe against Kavitha in both cases was complete and chargesheet/complaint had been filed in court and no custodial interrogation was needed. It said trial in both cases were unlikely to be completed soon since there are about 493 witnesses and the documentary evidence runs to nearly 50,000 pages and it was a fit case for bail as an undertrial’s custody should not be turned into a punishment.On the high court’s order denying bail on grounds of Kavitha being “highly educated and accomplished”, the bench said, “This court puts a caution that courts, while deciding such matters, should exercise discretion judiciously. The court does not say that merely because a woman is well-educated or sophisticated or a member of Parliament or member of Legislative Council is not entitled to the benefit of Section 45 of PMLA Act. We find that the learned single-judge bench totally misdirected itself,” the SC said.The bench also questioned why Buchi Babu, the auditor who allegedly received Rs 25 crore on behalf of Kavitha, was not an accused in the money laundering case when ED accepted that he took money. The court also said the role of Magunta Reddy, a liquor businessman, was similar to Kavitha’s but he was not made an accused but a witness. Reddy’s son was made an accused but he was granted pardon and turned approver in the case.“Prosecution has to be fair. A person who incriminates himself has been made a witness. Tomorrow, you pick up anyone as you please and leave anyone as you choose? You cannot pick and choose any accused. What is this fairness? Sorry to see this state of affairs. If he has a role, his role is almost equal to that of Kavitha. So you will pick and choose anyone?” the bench said.Sensing the mood of the bench, CBI and ED decided not to press the case against Kavitha as any adverse observations by the SC on the merits of the case would affect the trial.The bail plea of another accused in the case, Vijay Nair, also came up for hearing on Tuesday before a bench headed by Justice Hrishikesh Roy. It deferred the case for a week after CBI-ED sought time to respond to his petition.","Kavitha, daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was arrested by ED on March 15.
