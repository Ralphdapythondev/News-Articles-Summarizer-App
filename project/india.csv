"In battle for Haryana's Ambala, BJP banks on pro-women schemes; Congress leans on its 'pillars of justice'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-battle-for-haryanas-ambala-bjp-banks-on-pro-women-schemes-cong-leans-on-its-pillars-of-justice/articleshow/110379386.cms,"AMBALA: The Ambala Lok Sabha constituency of Haryana, which goes to polls in the penultimate phase on May 25, is set to see a fierce bipolar contest between the ruling BJP and the Congress.The BJP's Banto Devi Kataria (59), the wife of late MP Rattan Lal Kataria who won the previous two elections in 2014 and 2019 by handsome margins, is seeking a fresh term in the Lower House this year. However, he faces a doughty rival in the form of sitting Congress MLA from Mullana (reserved) assembly and the son of veteran Congress leader Phool Chand Mullana, Varun Chaudhary (44).The reserved seat for Scheduled Caste candidates comprises the entire Ambala and Panchkula districts as well as part of Yamunanagar district.Nine assembly segments come within the ambit of the Ambala Lok Sabha seat. Of these, five--Panchkula, Ambala Cantt, Ambala City, Jagadhri and Yamunanagar--are currently with the BJP. The remaining four--Kalka, Naraingarh, Mulana-SC and Sadhaura-SC--are held by the Congress.The last two elections for the constituency saw Rattan Lal Kataria coast to victory by a big margin of votes. The Congress stood second in both these elections.In 2019, Kataria won Ambala by a margin of 3.42 lakh votes, trouncing the then-Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja. He secured 57 per cent of the votes polled.It is believed that the lingering effects of the farmers' protest of 2020 against the now-withdrawn farm laws by the Centre, which spilt over into the following year, and the more recent stir by the annadatas, demanding a law guaranteeing MSP (minimum support price), among a host of other demands, could hurt the prospects of the BJP candidate this year.However, the BJP is counting on the undiminished charisma, popular appeal and electoral goodwill of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offset the lingering sentiment, if any, of the farmer protests. The flagship welfare schemes of the Centre, including those aimed at farmer welfare, also give the BJP hope of a hat-trick of wins in the constituency.Banto Kataria, who is contesting her maiden Lok Sabha elections , has also set her hopes of keeping the BJP flag flying in the constituency on the legacy of her husband and late former MP.Rattan Lal Kataria, her husband, was the BJP's Dalit face in Haryana who represented Ambala in the Lok Sabha thrice in an illustrious political career.On the campaign trail, she has also been highlighting the Centre's pro-women initiatives such as the passage of the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam or women's quota Bill in Parliament, by virtue of which a third of seats in the Lower House and state legislative assemblies are to be reserved for women. She has also built her campaign pitch around the Centre's flagship Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme.Just days before the election schedule was announced, the BJP changed its leadership in the state, replacing Manohar Lal Khattar with state unit president Nayab Singh Saini as the chief minister. The decision could help the party's chances of retaining the constituency, which is home to a sizeable population from the Saini caste.The BJP leadership also believes that having Saini, an OBC leader, as the chief minister will help in the consolidation of the non-Jat vote in the state in its favour.On the other hand, the Congress's Varun Chaudhary, in his campaign, has been going loud on his party's manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls, especially the part about the five 'pillars of justice' and the 25 guarantees each of them comprise. He has also been highlighting local issues such as the alleged drug menace and transportation woes in the constituency, accusing the BJP of failing to address these issues.There are a total of 14 candidates in the fray, including Jannayak Janta Party's Kiran Punia and Indian National Lok Dal's Gurpreet Singh. However, the BJP and the Congress are being seen as the main combatants in the battle for Ambala.","The Ambala Lok Sabha constituency of Haryana goes to polls in the penultimate phase on May 25.

Voters’ Profile



SP Banking On Verma’s Popularity



BJP Banks On Development



Issues That Matter



In Shahzadpur market of Akbarpur, the birthplace of Ram Manohar Lohia, stands a statue of the socialist ideologue, left unattended. It was two decades ago, in 2004, when the Samajwadi Party last won the Lok Sabha election from Ambedkarnagar .The constituency has been a BSP bastion since 1996, which the party president Mayawati represented thrice in 1998, 1999 and 2004. The BSP fort was breached only twice – by SP’s Shankhlal Majhi in 2004 by-elections and BJP’s Hari Om Pandey in 2014. In 2019, BSP’s Ritesh Pandey wrested the seat by securing over 52% votes, recording victory against BJP’s Mukut Bihari Verma by a margin of over 1 lakh votes.He is the son of veteran BSP leader Rakesh Pandey, now an SP MLA from Jalalpur. Rakesh had won the parliamentary seat on a BSP ticket in 2009.However, in March this year, Ritesh joined the saffron fold and is contesting the seat as a BJP candidate. He is facing another BSP turncoat, Lalji Verma , who had joined the ‘samajwadi’ camp in 2021 and was elected SP MLA from Katehari in the 2022 assembly polls. BSP has fielded Qamar Hayat Ansari.For Manoj Kumar Gaur, a sweet shop owner in Jalalpur area, Mayawati was the one who brought development to Ambedkarnagar.“Whatever you see here today is the result of the efforts of ‘Behenji’ (Mayawati). Any politician coming to seek votes here cannot give Jalalpur a miss. This is the road that takes you to Ambedkarnagar,” Gaur says. Another resident, Lal Bihari Yadav, says: “Only God knows who will win from here. I think it will be a close contest between Ritesh Pandey and Lalji Verma.” On BSP’s campaign, another resident observes, “Forget about someone campaigning for BSP, it is difficult to spot even party flags here.”Shankar Dayal Sharma, a voter from Akbarpur, says: “Mayawati made Ambedkarnagar a separate district in 1995. Mahamaya medical college, two engineering colleges, a diwani court, collectorate, agriculture research centre, three power plants, eight ITI colleges, Eklavya stadium, women’s degree college, Ambedkar villages, housing for poor under Kanshiram Awas Yojana, overbridge and roads are some of the major works done by BSP. She should have herself contested the election to ensure the party’s victory.” “The candidates that ‘Behenji’ fields in elections now have no recall value. The candidate that she has fielded in Ambedkarnagar is a local leader, who won local civic body’s chairman elections and is hardly known beyond Jalalpur,” he adds.BSP’s Qamar Hayat Ansari, has been the chairman of Jalalpur Nagar Palika thrice. The post has also been held twice each by his wife and father.Ambedkarnagar has around 18.7 lakh voters, of which SCs (Dalits) constitute over 26% (around 5 lakh), and Jatavs, BSP’s core voters, form the biggest chunk of around 3.8 lakh. There are around 5 lakh OBCs which include Nishads, Rajbhars, Kurmis, and Pals. Muslims constitute over 16% of voters, which is around 3.5 lakh.“In Muslim-dominated Tanda and Jalalpur, Rakesh Pandey has influence which may benefit his son Ritesh,” says Shivram Mishra, a local resident. Mohd Sultan Siddiqui from Tanda, which has over one lakh Muslim voters, says: “Muslims have no ‘rehnuma’ (leader). We will vote for the party that talks about our welfare.”The constituency also has over 1.7 lakh Kurmis who may support Lalji Verma. Ambedkarnagar has over 1.6 lakh Brahmins who traditionally vote for BJP. Yadavs, at around 1.3 lakh, and Thakurs at around 86,000, are also significant. “Rajputs could be among floating voters this time,” says Narendra Verma, an SP functionary.In the land of Lohia, Samajwadi Party is banking on the popularity of Lalji Verma, a prominent Kurmi leader, who has a long standing in politics. He has represented Tanda assembly constituency for four terms and Katehari twice.In 2007, when BSP formed a majority govt in UP, Verma was the state head of the party. He served as a cabinet minister in Mayawati govt in 2007 and held significant portfolios. In 2017, he was BSP’s legislature party leader in the UP assembly. His daughter, Chhaya Verma, was fielded by BSP in Jalalpur byelections in 2019, after the seat was vacated by BSP’s Ritesh Pandey, who won Ambedkarnagar Lok Sabha seat. However, she lost to Ritesh’s father, Rakesh Pandey, who contested as an SP candidate.SP had won Ambedkarnagar two decades ago, and since then, it has been making gains on BSP’s losses. Over a period, Lalji Verma, Ram Achal Rajbhar, Tribhuvan Dutt, Ram Murti Verma and Rakesh Pandey quit BSP to join SP. In the 2022 assembly elections, four out of five SP MLAs in Ambedkarnagar’s assembly segments were once with the BSP. However, what may give SP a tough time in 2024 is the fact that SBSP’s OP Rajbhar, Pallavi Patel of Apna Dal (K), Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan, who were with it in 2022, have moved on which could leave an impact on OBC and MBC votes.Beyond Ram temple and Modi magic, BJP is reaching out to voters with the projects that have been sanctioned in the district in the last 10 years. Land has been acquired for two industrial corridors in Katka, Jalalpur and Bivana. “Our welfare schemes have benefited everyone, irrespective of caste lines. Since there are a lot of farmers here, schemes catering to them have a huge impact,” says a BJP leader.Jobs, education and farmers’ uplift are the key areas which need the govt’s attention. “Ambedkarnagar has two cement plants and a unit of NTPC which generate jobs but the young population needs more job avenues,” says Rehan (20). “Quality of education in schools should also be improved,” adds his sister, Ruby, who aspires to be a doctor. Ambedkarnagar has a large rural population and has fertile land for agriculture. Cane growers abound in the region. “Many people are involved in the weaving industry which needs to be promoted,” says Shobhit Pal, who works in Urdu Bazaar locality.","The constituency has been a BSP bastion since 1996, which the party president Mayawati represented thrice in 1998, 1999 and 2004.

As compared to the 2019 and 2022 elections, what challenges are you facing in retaining this seat?

Based on poll equations, SP is confident of getting full support of Muslims after Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali joined the party. How is BJP tackling the Guddu Jamali factor?

Muslim voters are dominant in Azamgarh. How will the BJP face this challenge?

SP is banking on caste equations. How do you see the prospects of the party?

Many people claim that they have not received the benefits of the development works claimed to be done by the BJP. Your take.

What do you have to offer to the people of Azamgarh?

With sour and sweet experiences of losing 2019 Lok Sabha against Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and then wresting Azamgarh seat from SP by defeating Dharmendra Yadav in 2022 Lok Sabha by-poll, Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and BJP MPis confident that he would retain the seat. In an interview with, he says people are extending unflinching support to BJP. Excerpts:There is no challenge from anyone because people have seen how we did not leave Azamgarh even after losing the 2019 Lok Sabha poll and intensified development works after winning the 2022 byelection. People have seen that they ensured SP’s victory, but they were nowhere to be seen in their celebrations or sorrow. I stood with the people of Azamgarh when they needed me the most. A large number of people, who supported SP with full dedication, are now with us for various reasons.Guddu Jamali had the support of Muslim voters and crossed the 2 lakh mark in last elections because he was a BSP candidate. Now, he has joined SP in his individual capacity and BSP is not in alliance with the SP. SBSP and Janwadi Party and many others, who stood with the SP in the 2022 assembly election, have now joined hands with us.Muslims have availed maximum benefits of the schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As they have witnessed the execution of all schemes and plans without any discrimination, a large number of Muslims will support us.SP might be contesting the election on caste and communal equations, but the majority of people are standing solidly behind us as they don’t need a ‘bhagoda neta’ (a deserter). They got nothing in return for their support to SP president Akhilesh Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav. They need an MP, who stays with them and ensures development.SP had gifted jail to Azamgarh. Our double-engine govt ensured the establishment of Maharaja Suheldev State University, a music institute in Hariharpur, an airport, and rail and road network. Development works being done by BJP are evident and being experienced by the people of Azamgarh.Proper planning is needed to develop Azamgarh on the lines of Varanasi and Gorakhpur. We have ensured the implementation of the master plan for the planned development of Azamgarh. The city will also get a ring road in the coming years.","Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and BJP MP is confident that he would retain the seat.

'Escape mechanism...': Congress says EC withholding voter data; poll panel says application 'misleading',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/escape-mechanism-congress-says-ec-withholding-voter-data-poll-panel-says-application-misleading/articleshow/110371871.cms,"'Will cause chaos; application is misleading, false and based on mere suspicion'

'Can plant doubts in the mind of voters and political parties'

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Congress criticised the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday for withholding voter data from the public and accused the poll panel of failing to fulfill its constitutional obligations as well as exhibiting a biased inclination.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi accused the EC of attempting to act as the ""election department"" of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by not addressing complaints of model code violations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. Instead, the EC has been issuing generalized directions to political parties, which Singhvi referred to as ""false equivalences.""Singhvi's remarks followed the poll panel's submission of an affidavit to the Supreme Court , in which the commission stated that the ""indiscriminate disclosure"" of polling station-wise voter-turnout data and its publication on the EC website would lead to chaos in the ongoing Lok Sabha election machinery. Singhvi argued that the EC's actions regarding complaints against top BJP leaders and its refusal to disclose voter data are not befitting of a high-level constitutional institution.""This is against the constitutional responsibilities of the institution. This is the Election Commission, not the election agent of any party. When a constitutional institution does not follow the Constitution and shows inclination towards power, then it should be understood that this is the end of democracy,"" Singhvi said.""We are not asking the EC about EVMs (electronic voting machines) but about disclosure of data. Through this stand in its ridiculous affidavit, the EC is falling into the BJP's trap to orchestrate decimation and destruction of electoral democracy,"" he added.Singhvi alleged that the reply filed by the EC in the apex court is just an 'escape mechanism'""This reply of the Election Commission is just an escape mechanism. Whereas anyone can get this data by paying money to the Election Commission,"" Singhvi alleged.Earlier, EC had filed a counter affidavit in the Supreme Court, opposing the demand made by an NGO to upload polling station-wise voter turnout data on its website within 48 hours of the conclusion of polling for each phase of the Lok Sabha elections. The NGO, 'Association for Democratic Reforms', has also sought a direction to the poll panel to upload scanned legible copies of Form 17C Part-I (Account of Votes Recorded) of all polling stations immediately after the polls. The matter is scheduled to be heard by a vacation bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma.The Election Commission's 225-page affidavit said, ""It is submitted that if the reliefs sought by the petitioner is allowed, it will not only be in teeth of the aforesaid legal position but will also cause chaos in the election machinery which is already in motion for the ongoing General Elections to the Lok Sabha, 2024.""""This indicates that the allegation of discrepancies in voter turnout data made by the petitioner in the main petition as well as the present application is misleading, false and based on mere suspicion,"" it added.The poll panel had earlier also refuted the grand old party's claims of delaying in the release of the final voting percentages for the initial phases of the Lok Sabha elections, suggesting that such delays cast doubts on the credibility of the data provided by the poll panel.“Through innuendos and insinuations, the contents of the post tend to create disharmony in respect of the delicate space of election management, can plant doubts in the mind of voters and political parties…” EC said in response to a letter written by Congress president Kharge questioning the rationale behind EC's delay in releasing the voter turnout data for the first two phases of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.","Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi accused the EC of attempting to act as the ""election department"" of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Singhvi's remarks followed the poll panel's submission of an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which it stated that the ""indiscriminate disclosure"" of polling station-wise voter-turnout data would lead to chaos.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110372004,imgsize-1607936,width-400,resizemode-4/110372004.jpg"

How confident are you of your victory in Azamgarh. Are caste equations working in your favour?

How will you stop the division of OBC who traditionally support

SP

in Azamgarh?

Your rival parties are questioning why SP prefers Yadav candidates only from Saifai family. Your take.

BJP is claiming that it will defeat SP in Azamgarh based on development works done by it?

What is SP doing to stop BJP from repeating a performance like that in 2019 general elections?

Samajwadi Party candidate from Azamgarh,, says that those trying to become well-wishers of the Yadav community should first ensure the release of innocent youths languishing in jails and stop “fake encounters”. In an interview with, Yadav says that he is confident of his victory as people are looking at INDIA bloc with great expectations. Excerpts:This election is no longer about caste and communal equations. People from all sections of the society, including OBC, Dalits and minorities, who have faith in democracy, Constitution , and development, are now united. The young generation is upset over paper leaks, unemployment and Agniveer scheme, and has high expectations from the INDIA bloc.There is no division of traditional votes. More than 90% of the people from all sections of the society are extending support to INDIA bloc. People do not want scrapping of the Constitution, reservation, and democracy.If they are trying to prove that they are well-wishers of Yadavs, they should stop fake encountersof Yadavs, and release those who are in jail on fake charges. In fact, they are upset with SP’s PDA formula given by party chief Akhilesh Yadav. They are making an issue out of five tickets to a family.

And, 33 days after its opening by PM, the same room caught fire. They are trying to take credit for the works already done by SP.Today, BJP has nothing to offer to the people. They are claiming that they will win over 400 seats. But as the election is progressing, it is becoming clear that they will stay below 200 seats.","Samajwadi Party candidate from Azamgarh says those trying to become well-wishers of the Yadav community should first ensure the release of innocent youths languishing in jails.

Why Naveen factor is Pradhan concern in west Odisha fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-naveen-factor-is-pradhan-concern-in-west-odisha-fight/articleshow/110378392.cms,"SAMBALUPUR: Sambalpur , the gateway to western Odisha , is witnessing a high-profile battle with BJD expecting a favourable mandate for a “job well done” in the state and BJP counting on anti-incumbency .Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , 54, is back for a Lok Sabha contest after 20 years while BJD has deployed its No.2, Pranab Prakash Das, tagged publicly as the regional party’s senapati (commander), to challenge him.Sambalpur constituency spans three districts: Deogarh, Sambalpur, and parts of Angul. BJP’s Nitesh Ganga Deb emerged victorious in 2019. BJP had won all five Lok Sabha seats in western Odisha back then but could manage only eight of the 35 assembly segments. BJP expects Sambalpur to set a pan-Odisha momentum even in Vidhan Sabha contests. The saffron party is also banking on PM Narendra Modi’s popularity. “The trust in the PM is very high in Odisha. Moreover, people are angry with BJD and there is strong anti-incumbency. We are not only winning big in Lok Sabha but going to form a govt in Vidhan Sabha,” said Pradhan.BJP did better in western Odisha than in the state’s coastal areas last time. And the party is drawing strength from the region’s proximity to Chhattisgarh, which has a BJP govt. More than 100 BJP functionaries from Chhattisgarh, including the entire Cabinet led by its CM Vishnu Deo Sai, have been campaigning in western Odisha.BJP’s manifesto includes several key promises aimed at attracting voters in western Odisha. One of the most significant among them is the establishment of a second AllIndia Institute of Medical Sciences in Sambalpur. Furthermore, the party has announced its intention to initiate a proposal to grant central university status to Sambalpur University. The party’s commitment to buying paddy at Rs 3,100 per quintal, up from the current minimum support price of Rs 2,183, is also expected to resonate with the farmers in Hirakud command area.As chief minister Naveen Patnaik seeks a sixth straight term, anti-incumbency may be a threat for BJD in western Odisha. Union home minister Amit Shah in his rally in Sunda rgarh last week complained of the state govt’s step-motherly treatment of western Odisha.Claiming that the BJD govt had failed to bring development to the state in its 25 years in office, pushing it back by 50 years, Shah said, “Step-motherly treatment has been meted out by this (BJD) govt, particularly to the western region.”BJD candidate Das begged to differ, saying there is a strong sentiment in favour of Patnaik across the state. “People have decided to bring Naveen Patnaik back as they want him to continue the good work he’s been doing. Under Naveen babu’s leadership, BJD results get better in poll after poll,” he said.But what does the common man think? Near the 160-year-old sarsatia shop in Budhima Gali in Kunjelpada, owner Rinku dada claims Patnaik gets the Sambalpur delicacy from his establishment given that not many places have continued the art of making this sweet. A picture of Pradhan having sarsatia is seen at the shop. A local, who did not want to be named, said, “Naveen is still popular in the assembly, but there is now a real fear that he will hand over the CM post to some nonOdia.” Her reference could be to BJD strategist VK Pandian.Tinku Nayak, a cab driver from Bolangir, said: “BJD is not going to have it easy, if at all it wins. In Lok Sabha, BJP will get most seats. Naveen babu didn’t do anything for us (drivers). The govt hospitals in Sambalpur don’t even have doctors.”Sambalpur has been the focal point of a long-standing demand for a separate bench of the Orissa High Court in the region. The lawyers’ agitation, which had been going on for decades, came to a sudden halt in 2022 following a violent turn of events and strong objections from Supreme Court.Pradhan, a prominent OBC leader belonging to the Chasa caste, has consolidated support within the community, which has a significant presence in Sambalpur. In the previous election, Odisha witnessed a split voting pattern. For instance, in Bargarh, BJP failed to secure any of the seven assembly seats but managed to win the Lok Sabha seat. This time, BJP’s campaign strategy focuses on prioritising assembly seats and then targeting the Lok Sabha with the goal of achieving a “double engine” govt.","Sambalpur constituency spans three districts: Deogarh, Sambalpur, and parts of Angul.

Agnipath faces ballot test in jawan heartland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-faces-ballot-test-in-jawan-heartland/articleshow/110378288.cms,"A part from basic issues, anguish against Centre’s much-touted Agniveer scheme , under which youngsters are engaged as soldiers for a short term of four years, seems to have taken centre stage in parliamentary polls in Haryana, especially in rural areas. Almost every political party campaigning in the state is promising to end this scheme, if voted to office, and reinstating the old pattern of recruitment that provides pension on completion of 15-year service.In a state with high unemployment, Agniveer — officially known as the Agnipath Yojana — has led to changes in aspirations of young Haryana men seeking job security.Pawan Jangra, a native of Pabra in Haryana’s Hisar district, always dreamt of joining the Indian Army but as he was close to achieving his childhood dream, it became his last option. He is now focusing on police jobs such as constable, relegating his dream job in Army to the end of his options. He is enrolled in an academy near Hisar that trains boys from rural background for the armed forces.Like Pawan, several other Army aspirants now prefer central police jobs over the Army because of restrictive options linked to Angiveer intake.“Even if we are selected under Agniveer scheme, our struggle would begin after release on completion of four years. It is better to work hard and choose police service or other similar jobs where we can at least serve till the age of superannuation,” says Deepak, a Hansi resident undergoing training at one of the academies.Joginder Punia, who runs a coaching academy in Hisar district, claims the number of applications under Agniveer in the Army recruitment office, Hisar, was around 22,000 in 2023. It has dropped to around 6,500 this year.“Army is no longer the first choice for the boys from rural areas of Haryana. I had two boys in my academy who were selected for Army under Agniveer scheme but, after the results for Group-D posts in Haryana were declared, they decided to opt for the Group-D post, which is equivalent to a peon’s job, because it is a permanent and secure job,” adds Punia.Pawan Berwal, a former soldier who is now running a coaching academy in Jind district, says that other ‘belt’ services (paramilitary and state police) used to be the last choice for youngsters in Haryana and they chose to opt for these only on passing the Army enrolment age. However, now the Army is their last choice, so much so that the craze to go abroad has replaced it.“When the Army was selecting youngsters based on the old pattern, prior to the Agniveer scheme, we used to have 400-500 residential students preparing for the Army physical and written tests. Now, this number has come down to 40 only. Youngsters in Haryana are preferring to go abroad after spending Rs 20-30 lakh so that they can get citizenship of another country in 3-4 years. That is a more secure option,” he explains.Dinesh Sangwan, who retired from the Indian Navy, is director of one of the academies in Rohtak district. He recalls a time when young men came armed with a strong ‘sifarish’ (recommendation) to get coaching for military recruitment. All his five hostels used to have 100% occupancy and aspirants even lived in nearby villages as paying guests to be able to train under him.“Now, very few students come to prepare for the Army and that too as their last choice. Around 6-7 academies in Haryana have shut down after the implementation of the Agniveer scheme. Boys from Haryana have a natural tendency to join armed forces, but they do not want to spoil the prime of their lives where there is no security after serving for four years,” adds Sangwan.TOI sent a detailed questionnaire to the headquarters of the Ambala recruiting zone, which looks after Agniveer recruitment in the region, but received no response despite several reminders.Indian Army has been the largest employer for youngsters from Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh with around one-fourth of soldiers selected yearly across the country hailing from this region.Per central govt data tabled in Parliament in Feb 2022, during the last recruitment drive held in 2019-20 for selection of jawans, a total of 18,798 youngsters were selected from this region.However, after suspension of the Army’s enrolment drive for two years due to Covid-19 pandemic, around 37,000 youngsters from the region were deprived of these jobs. Thereafter, Centre launched its much-touted Agniveer scheme.In all, 78,692 aspirants were selected by Army from across statesin the last recruitment drive completed per the old pattern in 2019-20. Thus, the region alone sent around 24% of the total recruits selected from all over the country.As per data, the intake of soldiers from Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal in 2017-18 was 4,988, 3,634 and 2,376, respectively, which increased to 7,813, 5,097 and 5,883, respectively, in 2019-20. There were three seats for UT Chandigarh, and these were increased to six in 2019-20. With this, a total of 18,798 young men from these three states and UT Chandigarh were selected by the Army in its last recruitment drive in 2019-20.","Agniveer scheme, under which youngsters are engaged as soldiers for a short term of four years, has led to changes in aspirations of young Haryana men seeking job security.

‘Don’t Want Group D Job’

‘Berozgaron Ki Baraat’

Who Can Deliver?

Manju (26) and Ashish Balhara had their future mapped out when they tied the knot three years ago in Rohtak’s Bahu Akbarpur village. Both were certain their qualifications — Manju is an MSc (maths) and a BEd, and Ashish has an MBA degree — would land them govt jobs. Neither found one.Ashish took up a job with a private company in Gurgaon. Manju, who tried for three years to get a teaching job in a govt school and cleared both state and central teacher eligibility tests, has resorted to her last career choice — giving tuitions to children in the village.“The state does not have any openings for TGT (trained graduate teacher) and PGT (postgraduate teacher) posts in Mathematics. I registered on HKRN too, but I haven’t received any response,” she said, referring to govt’s Haryana Kaushal Rojgar Nigam platform for job seekers.“You’ll find many unemployed graduates when you go to villages. Youngsters like us study so we can get work. We can’t rely on farming. It doesn’t pay anything,” Ashish said. He isn’t off the mark. Ask Deepak Kaushik, a graduate who runs a grocery store in Pehrawar village of Rohtak. Or Bharat Singh, a graduate who lost his job and now drives an autorickshaw in Bhiwani’s Kalinga for a living.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the Union ministry of statistics and pro gramme implementation ranked Haryana third on the list of states with highest unemployment rates between July 2022 and June 2023. At 6.1%, Haryana’s joblessness rate is almost double that of the national average of 3.2%. The unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 9.5% for the 15-29 age group, up from 8.3% the previous quarter, latest PLFS data shows.Other than farming, there are few career avenues beyond the glass walls of Gurgaon’s corporate offices. Most aspire for govt jobs (Group C and D posts), become teachers or join the forces — police and military. But govt recruitment has now dipped. And, since Centre announced its Agnipath scheme in 2022 for recruiting defence personnel below officer rank, perception of the most coveted job has changed among the youth.As the state goes to polls on Saturday, youngsters in villages in five districts TOI visited — Rohtak, Jhajjar, Sonipat, Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri — had a common refrain: lack of employment. Their primary concern will drive their vote, which they said would go to the party that creates jobs evenly across villages and towns.“In 2019, 75% reservation for locals was promised by govt. They knew that it would be challenged in courts. It was just a gimmick. They glorify more and execute less on the ground. Similarly, Agniveer was a big loss for us in Haryana,” said Pinaki Dev, a resident of Bahu Akbarpur in Rohtak. Govt told legislators in Vidhan Sabha last year that 13.9 lakh youngsters enrolled in district employment offices between 2015 and 2022. Of these, around 1 lakh got permanent jobs.“I tried to get a private job, but salaries were too low. I registered with HKRN, but there are no vacancies for mechanical engineers. I don’t want to take up a Group D job with an engineering degree… So, I’m helping my family on the farm and preparing for Staff Selection Commission (SSC),” said Sachin Balhara (24), also of Bahu Akbarpur.Group D category is for non technical jobs such as sanitation staff, gardener, peon and driver.Deepak Kaushik (32), who runs a grocery store in Pehrawar, 20km away, said: “Recruitment exams are held for posts like gram sachiv (secretary) but the results aren’t declared. This keeps candidates in a limbo.” He added: “While the PM is 73 and running for a third term, there are schemes that say youngsters can only serve in the Army for four years. Is that fair?”Kaushik’s friend Mukul (26) said recruitments came to a halt during Covid, and paper leaks have hit their confidence. “For young people, caste politics holds little significance. We want candidates who promise to deliver employment opportunities,” he said.Two large groups of govt job applicants have, meanwhile, taken to the streets to protest. In the election season in Haryana, applicants for govt jobs and posts of TGTs have been organising ‘Berozgaron ki Baraat’ (procession of unemployed) in different districts.TGT candidates who took their exams last April are still waiting for their results, as are Group C job applicants who appeared for the exams conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) last Aug because of subsequent court moves.Vidya from Sonipat, who was part of one such procession, said, “PM talks about ‘Modi ki guarantee’. And govt says ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’. We have studied, but there are no jobs. We are on the streets despite our education,” she said.In Sonipat’s Kharkhoda, Randeep Dahiya (56), who runs a gaushala, was worried whether his two children would get jobs. “My son is 26 and has completed BCom, MCom and BEd. He is now studying law. My daughter (24) has done MSc in agriculture and is preparing for a PhD. Since they did not get jobs, they decided to study further,” Dahiya said, adding: “Logon ko badlaav chahiye (people want change).”Some 90km west of Kharkhoda, a 24-year-old standing at a food stall in Bhiwani’s Kharak, asked where the private jobs were beyond Gurgaon-Manesar. Vishnu Parmar worked at an auto spare parts factory in Manesar. “The company shut down and now I can’t support my elderly parents. I have been job-hunt ing. I have ITI certification, too. But nothing seems to be of use,” he said, adding BJP was the only party that he believed could provide “jobs without reservation”.Satish Sharma, who has switched to selling fast food in the village market, says he gave up on his dream of joining the Army. “I don’t have a choice anymore. Things have changed after the Agnipath scheme.”There are 2.6 lakh people currently enrolled in govt’s Saksham Yuva portal that helps youngsters get jobs. Among them are 22,400 postgraduates, 70,226 graduates and 1.6 lakh with intermediate degrees.Contract JobsAn independent association of trade unions called Sarv Karmchari Sangh has been demanding that the govt dissolve HKRN. It claims govt is offering only contractual jobs through the portal, likening it to “giving peanuts when people need an actual source of earning and stable work”.Congress sees evidence of people’s frustration with 10 years of BJP rule in the bleak jobs scene. Udai Bhan, state president of Haryana Congress, told TOI, “The CM is ending the practice of providing regular govt jobs that students grow up aspiring for with HKRN’s contractual mode. It has been years since a recruitment exam has not ended up in court. There is no system of reservation in HKRN jobs. Students from the marginalised communities have no way into the system due to lack of appointments. Youths have been preparing for govt jobs for years. Those who cracked recruitment exams in 2016-17 are still waiting for job adverts. They have gone into depression, and ultimately, coerced by the situation into accepting whatever little this govt has to offer.”BJP, however, believes this is a negative campaign by the opposition and the voters will see through it.Arvind Saini, state media incharge of BJP, said, “The current BJP govt has made significant strides in addressing the problem of unemployment by introducing a transparent and fair appointment process. Unlike the previous Congress regime, where the use of ‘parchi’ and ‘kharchi’ was prevalent, BJP has worked to eliminate corrupt practices. By doing so, govt has ensured qualified candidates have an equal opportunity to secure employment based on merit, rather than through nepotism or bribery. As a result, the issue of unemployment has taken a backseat in the current election, as voters recognise efforts made by the BJP govt.”","At 6.1%, Haryana’s joblessness rate is almost double that of the national average of 3.2%. The unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 9.5% for the 15-29 age group, up from 8.3% the previous quarter.

Cyber Fraud: 46% of cyber fraud in India stems from Southeast Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/46-of-cyber-fraud-in-india-stems-from-southeast-asia/articleshow/110374898.cms,"Large number of Chinese known to work in cybercrime hubs: I4C chief

NEW DELHI: Jamtara and Mewat have been upstaged as hotspots of financial cyber fraud in India, with 46% of defrauded money now bring lost to cybercrimes originating in southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.I4C and state law enforcement agencies have cracked down on some of these illegal recruitment agents. The foreign ministry has so far facilitated the return of 360 Indians trapped in these cybercrime units, with 60 more due to return from Cambodia soon.According to Kumar, Rs 1,420 crore was lost to 62,587 investment scams, Rs 222 crore to 20,043 trading scams, Rs 120 crore to 4,600 digital arrest scams and Rs 13 crore to 1,725 romance/dating scams, all originating from southeast Asia between Jan and April this year. Last year, more than one lakh investment scams originating from the region were reported on Indian national cybercrime reporting portal and 10,000 FIRs registered.Not ruling out China's involvement in these scams, the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) chief said that a large number of Chinese people were known to work in these scam hubs and many of the suspected apps used for to defraud people are in Chinese language.Amid an overall increase in big ticket frauds reported in 2024, with over six lakh complaints involving a total amount of Rs 7,061 crore received on the national cybercrime reporting portal, I4C has intervened to save Rs 812.7 crore from being defrauded.Collaboration between I4C and law enforcement agencies has helped debit-freeze 3.2 lakh mule accounts in last four months, get more than 3,000 URLs and 595 apps blocked under Information Technology Act, 5.3 lakh SIM cards and over 80,000 IMEI numbers suspended since July 2023. Also, there have been 3,401 cases of unlawful content being taken down from social media, websites and WhatsApp in last two months.Indians who are lured to southeast Asia's organised cybercrime factories with fake jobs advertised by illegal recruiters - detected in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Delhi - are pushed into defrauding unsuspecting victims in India through social media advertisements and messaging promising quick financial gains on their investments or through gaming, digital arrests where the cyber offenders pose as as a law enforcement personnel; or romance, dating scams. ""These gangs work in an organised manner, from scam compounds... many of them were linked to casinos earlier,"" said Kumar.The illicit gains from these cybercrime activities originating in southeast Asia are laundered through sophisticated financial channels including Indian bank accounts, cryptocurrency transactions, cash withdrawals, etc, he added.In May this year, Visakhapatnam cybercrime police had arrested three illegal recruitment agents who were sending gullible youth to Cambodia.Similar arrests were carried out in Odisha. Ministry of external affairs has been working with Phnom Penh to rescue the Indians trapped in these compounds and get them home.Govt had earlier this month set up an inter-ministerial committee comprising various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to tackle the ""spurt"" in transnational organised cyber crimes being launched against Indians from southeast Asian countries.","46% of defrauded money now bring lost to cybercrimes originating in southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.

Lok Sabha elections: Absolute no. of votes down in 88 seats from 5 years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absolute-no-of-votes-down-in-88-seats-from-5-yrs-ago/articleshow/110375046.cms,"In

, 25% of seats saw fewer votes cast than in '19

After five rounds of polling, an analysis of turnout shows that of the 409 seats where data can be compared with 2019, nearly two-thirds, or 258, have witnessed a lower percentage turnout this year and 88 (more than one in five) have seen even the absolute number of votes drop from five years ago.Seats with lower turnout or lower absolute vote numbers are not evenly spread but bunched in some states. For instance, all 20 of Kerala's seats saw the turnout drop and 12 of them recorded fewer votes in EVMs than in 2019. In Uttarakhand, too, all five seats saw lower turnout and three of the six had fewer people voting this time.In Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, nearly half the seats saw the absolute number of voters declining and almost 90% of the seats in these states recorded lower turnout. Three-quarters of seats in UP and Madhya Pradesh also saw lower turnouts, but only about a third of the seats in these Hindi heartland states recorded fewer votes than in 2019.In Gujarat and West Bengal, turnouts were lower than in 2019 in all but one seat in each case, but not a single Bengal seat had fewer voters with the increase in the electorate more than offsetting the drop in turnout. In Gujarat, about a quarter of the seats saw fewer votes cast. Similarly, in Bihar, 21 of the 24 seats recorded lower turnouts than 2019, but only one saw the absolute number of votes go down.In Maharashtra, 20 of the 48 seats had lower turnouts but only six had fewer people turning up to vote on polling day. Interestingly, of the six seats across the country that had a lower electorate than in 2019 among the 409 being analysed here, five were in Maharashtra and included Pune and Mumbai South. However, only three of the five had fewer votes being cast this time.Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana and West Bengal had no seats with fewer votes this time than in 2019, though all of them had some that recorded lower turnouts. Chhattisgarh was the only major state in which both turnout and absolute vote counts were higher in every seat.While EC has not put out data on the absolute number of votes cast in each seat, the fact that the electorate is known and the turnout percentage is also known to two decimal places means it is possible to work out an approximate value for votes polled. This analysis is based on that approximation. Of the 428 seats that have polled, only 409 are comparable with 2019 since the 14 seats in Assam and five seats in Jammu & Kashmir have been redrawn since then.","Of the 409 seats where data can be compared with 2019, nearly two-thirds, or 258, have witnessed a lower percentage turnout. 88 (more than one in five) have seen even the absolute number of votes drop from five years ago.

Percentage of women voting more than men's in 137 seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/percentage-of-women-voting-more-than-mens-in-137-seats/articleshow/110374270.cms,"NEW DELHI: In nearly 32% of Lok Sabha constituencies - 137 out of the 427 seats for which voter turnout data has been released - females have accounted for higher percentage of votes cast in the first five phases of elections.According to political analysts , though higher percentage of women voters does not imply their dominance in numbers, more females coming out to vote is an encouraging trend and a signal that they are seeking more say in governance.The Election Commission 's turnout data show that in Bihar, where polling has been completed in 24 of 40 seats, a higher percentage of female voters came out to exercise their franchise in 20 constituencies in the last four phases. In the first phase, only Jamui saw higher percentage of women electors casting their votes.In Jharkhand too, where polling has been completed for eight seats in the fourth and fifth phases, a higher percentage of females turned up at polling stations across all constituencies. In the case of Odisha, five out of the nine constituencies where polling has been completed saw a similar trend. In West Bengal, 18 out of the 25 constituencies that have gone to polls have also reported higher percentage of registered women electors casting their votes.The trend was no different in nearly half of all the seats in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, while all the LS constituencies in Gujarat and Maharashtra saw higher percentage of male voters exercising their franchise than women.Ranjana Kumari, director of Centre for Social Research, said, ""We are observing a similar pattern where women are voting more in numbers in many constituencies in this election. Women have largely been the beneficiaries (lavarthis) of welfare programmes. The political aspiration among local women has also increased since 1993 when Panchayati Raj Act was passed and women became elected representatives. That's also helping women make their own decisions and there is more political consciousness.""Prasanna Mishra, a Bhubaneswar-based former bureaucrat and public policy analyst, said more women voting indicates better social mobility. ""There is a spontaneous desire of women folk to express their entitlement. But it may not be necessary that they are supporting the incumbent govt for creating a large number of women self help groups,"" he added.","In nearly 32% of Lok Sabha constituencies - 137 out of the 427 seats for which voter turnout data has been released - females have accounted for higher percentage of votes cast in the first five phases of elections.
