"Biden administration satisfied with accountability it has demanded from India in Pannun case, says Garcetti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biden-administration-satisfied-with-accountability-it-has-demanded-from-india-in-pannun-case-says-garcetti/articleshow/109994410.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti expressed satisfaction with the accountability demanded by the Biden administration from India regarding allegations of officials' involvement in a plot to kill a Khalistani separatist on US soil.Speaking at a council on foreign relations event, Garcetti emphasized the importance of accountability in maintaining the US-India relationship, saying that this incident could potentially be the first significant challenge in their partnership.""When I was referring to a relationship that might have bumps along the road, this would be potentially the first big fight in a relationship. And so far, knock on wood, I would say the administration is satisfied with the accountability that we've demanded on this, because this is a red line for America, for our citizens,"" he said.Garcetti highlighted the ongoing criminal case and indictment, stressing that any connection to State actors must be met with accountability. He acknowledged India's establishment of a commission of inquiry and the expectation of shared information while the US pursues American justice.""So, there's been a commission of inquiry that India has brought together, and that we expect, while we do the criminal case that is about American justice, that there need to be consequences and shared information. So far, one of the most difficult things you can do as an ambassador in diplomacy, I have been satisfied with what they have done. I think the administration is, but we have many steps still to go,"" Garcetti said.The case revolves around Pannun, an India-designated terrorist holding American and Canadian citizenship.According to the US Justice Department's indictment, Nikhil Gupta was allegedly approached by an unidentified government employee to hire a hitman for the attempted assassination that was foiled by US police. However, the Russian and Indian authorities have expressed doubts about the Washington-provided evidence and have demanded hard evidence of India's purported participation in the plan.Amidst these developments, the ministry of external affairs has vehemently denied any official engagement in the reported assassination plot, dismissing it as baseless speculation. Describing it as an ""unwarranted and unsubstantiated"" imputation on a ""serious matter"" that is under investigation, MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was ""speculative and irresponsible.""","US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti expressed satisfaction with the accountability demanded by the Biden administration from India.

US Ambassador Garcetti dismisses concerns about democracy in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-ambassador-garcetti-dismisses-concerns-about-democracy-in-india/articleshow/109994237.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration 's top diplomat in New Delhi on Thursday dismissed concerns being raised in certain quarters about democracy in India and observed that in many ways Indians are better than the Americans.At an event organised here by the Council on Foreign Relations , a top American think-tank, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti told the audience he was confident that ""10 years from now India is going to be a vibrant democracy as it is today in terms of free and fair elections "".""Again there's things that probably are worse and there's things that are better. They have a law, you can't go more than two kilometers to vote. So there'll be one guy who lives in the mountains as a monk (at) someplace. They will walk for two days to bring the voting machine, execute the vote,"" he said, responding to a question expressing concerns over the status of democracy in India.He said that during elections times in India, there are people who check trucks to make sure that nobody has cash going around. ""There's probably walk-in money, as they call it in some cities here in the United States, Philadelphia, that's like a tradition where cash kind of gets you votes and things like that. So, I've been impressed with certain things they do that are better than us.""He, however, added there are things that ""we keep our eyes on. And I just disagree that we don't speak out about them"",""We put them out. It's not the only thing. I mean, some people want us to only say that. But this is too important a relationship to spend all day long only saying that over and over. You're not going to get anything else done. It'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy that they will not be close to us. Whereas where we find the common ground, which I think is really human to human, very deep,"" he said.""You have a lot of leaders there who have come worked, been educated here, have an affinity. There's a huge positive polling of Americans. I told the president before the state visit that Americans poll better in India than Americans do in America. They like us more than we like ourselves. That's rare in the world today,"" Garcetti said, adding that Poland is the only other country that comes close.This is a huge advantage for the US, he said.""... If you don't know state governments in India, which are as powerful as the centre and are run by opposition parties, and there's plenty of criticisms you can make, too, about other parties that have been in power. If you look at history in India, there's not been some golden era where everybody's rights have been respected,"" Garcetti said.""America's role is to stand up for the principles and the values that we have, to never retreat from those and talk about them. But is the relationship only that and those points of conflict? Absolutely not. It would be bad diplomacy, it would be bad policy. But in my heart, 100 percent, I believe, not only will this still continue to be one of the world's most vibrant democracies,"" Garcetti said.""I 100 percent believe we can trust this relationship.

"Wasn’t raped, Sandeshkhali ‘survivor’ says in video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wasnt-raped-sandeshkhali-survivor-says-in-video/articleshow/109989710.cms,"As clips emerge, TMC asks: Did BJP mislead Prez on Sandeshkhali?

SANDESHKHALI: An older video of BJP ’s Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra purportedly suggesting that some of the Sandeshkhali “rape survivors” taken to Delhi to meet President Murmu may have been “paid to impersonate” Thursday added grist to Trinamool ’s allegations about the unrest in this Bengal pocket being engineered by the saffron party.Patra’s video, part of an interview she had given to a TV channel before her nomination, surfaced along with another clip showing one of the “survivors” telling a reporter that BJP members made her sign a blank sheet of paper without disclosing what it was for.She denied facing sexual assault or visiting a police station to lodge a complaint, reports Sanjib Chakraborty.Rekha Patra, who filed her nomination for the Basirhat seat Thursday — Sandeshkhali is part of the constituency — declined comment on the controversy. TMC’s counter-attack started with two videos that emerged last week, one of them of a purported sting. The party presented this as “evidence” of BJP’s Bengal brass, including Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari, allegedly instigating or intimidating several women from Sandeshkhali into filing concocted rape complaints.TMC moved Election Commission, seeking custodial interrogation of everyone featuring and being named in the videos. The sting purports to show BJP’s Sandeshkhali Block-II chief Gangadhar Koyal admitting that the “Sandeshkhali movement” was Adhikari’s brainchild and that the rape complainants did what they were told to.On Wednesday, the first of the “survivors” did an about-turn, saying she faced no such assault and that local BJP members forced her to sign a blank sheet of paper and approach police. She complained of threats and a social boycott because of her decision to withdraw the allegedly false charge of rape.The other “survivor” who came clean is seen in the video telling reporters a local BJP Mahila Morcha member identified as Piyali, aka Mampi Das, took her and some others to meet a team from National Commission for Women.In the oldest of the clips, BJP candidate Patra refers to 11 people from Sandeshkhali, including five women, meeting Prez Murmu on March 11. “We are the real victims, we are still in Sandeshkhali. Then who are those who were taken to Delhi to meet Rashtrapati Madam? Nobody informed us before the meeting,” she is heard saying.Two other women, including BJP worker Piyali, purportedly feature in the same video.“We learned only from the media that some women were taken to Delhi to meet Prez. Anup Das (a fellow BJP worker), who used to be paid Rs 10,000 by Trinamool’s Shibaprasad Hazra a month, took these women to Delhi,” Piyali tells the reporter.Anup wasn’t available for comment, but Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya defended him. “Anup has been with BJP for over a decade and has helped the Sandeshkhali survivors get legal assistance. He didn’t do anything wrong. (Rekha) Patra joined BJP after the Sandeshkhali movement,” he said.Bengal’s BJP co-minder Amit Malviya argued that Patra never suggested that crimes didn’t take place in Sandeshkhali. “First attempt was to put out a fake, AI-generated video, claiming that the movement was orchestrated and funded (by Adhikari),” he wrote on X.Trinamool accused BJP brass of spinning “a web of lies and deceit”.“Can we say that BJP even misled Prez? How could the delegation from Sandeshkhali go and meet Murmu without the approval of the party leadership? To what depravity will BJP plunge for some votes?” state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said.Sandeshkhali police issued notice to BJP worker Piyali under Section 41A of CrPC asking her to report at the local police station within three days. Another complaint was lodged at the police station against BJP candidate Patra and Koyal.","Trinamool accused BJP brass of spinning “a web of lies and deceit” TMC moved Election Commission, seeking custodial interrogation of everyone featuring and being named in the videos.

NEW DELHI: The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) recently published a study that analyzed the shifts in religious demographics across various countries from 1950 to 2015. The study, named ""Share of religious minorities: A cross-country analysis,"" shed light on change in demographics from 1950 to 2015.According to the findings, India's Hindu majority population experienced a decline of 7.81 per cent during the 65-year period.In contrast, the Muslim community in India witnessed a significant increase of 43.15 per cent within the same timeframe.The study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how religious composition has evolved in different nations over the past several decades, offering valuable insights into this critical dimension of demographic transformation.According to the report, the global average for the share of the majority religious denomination in 1950 was 75%. By 2015, this figure had decreased by approximately 22%, indicating a global trend towards greater religious heterogeneity. The study highlights significant regional differences. For instance, more than half of the countries with the largest demographic shifts are located in Africa, where shifts from animist majorities to other religious denominations were most common.Countries like India and several OECD nations have also seen declines in their majority religious shares, signaling a diversification of religious demographics. In contrast, many Muslim-majority countries have seen an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups.The report reveals that India, like many other South Asian nations, has experienced a noticeable decrease in the share of its majority religious group. In 1950, the majority religious group in India comprised a larger share of the population compared to 2015, reflecting a trend towards greater religious diversity and pluralism. This change is attributed to various factors including demographic shifts, migration patterns, and changing socio-political landscapes.As per the report, specifically, all the Muslim-majority countries in this study saw an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups, with the sole exception of the Maldives. In the Maldives, the majority group, Shafi’i Sunnis, experienced a decrease of 1.47 per cent.Among the non-Muslim majority nations, the trends were mixed. Myanmar, India, and Nepal all saw a reduction in the proportion of their majority religious groups. Conversely, in Sri Lanka and Bhutan, the share of the majority denomination saw an increase. The extent of these changes varied widely across the region, with Myanmar experiencing the most significant drop of 9.84 percent in its Theravada Buddhist population, reducing from 79 per cent to 71 per cent. Bangladesh observed the most substantial increase, where the Hanafi Muslim population surged by 18.55 per cent, from 74 per cent to 88 per cent of the populace.The share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent from 1950 to 2015, moving from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent. Concurrently, the Muslim population in India grew from 9.84 per cent in 1950 to 14.09 per cent in 2015, marking a 43.15 per cent increase in their proportion.Smaller increments were noted among other religious groups: Christians increased from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent, Sikhs from 1.24 per cent to 1.85 per cent, and Buddhists from 0.05 per cent to 0.81 per cent.In contrast, the Jain community in India saw a decrease from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015. The Parsi population experienced a significant decline, decreasing by 85 per cent from a 0.03 per cent share in 1950 to just 0.004 per cent in 2015. These figures underscore the complex and evolving religious landscape in India and the broader region, reflecting broader social, cultural, and possibly political changes.The Hindu population in Bangladesh experienced a dramatic 66% decline from 23% in 1950 to 8% in 2015, while the Buddhist and Christian populations remained relatively stable or increased, respectively.The Tibetan Buddhist majority in Bhutan grew from 72% to 84% between 1950 and 2015, possibly influenced by the forced eviction of Nepali Hindus in the 1990s, which reduced the Hindu population by 50%.The Buddhist majority increased by 5% from 64% in 1950 to 67% in 2015, while the Hindu and Christian populations saw decreases, and the Muslim population rose to become the third-largest religious group.The Muslim population increased overall, especially among Shia and Ahmadiyya groups, while the Hindu population plummeted by 80% from 13% to 2% over 65 years.The Muslim population slightly increased from 99.4% in 1950 to 99.7% in 2015, with Sunni Muslims experiencing a minor increase and Shia numbers remaining stable.Unique among Muslim-majority countries, Maldives saw a slight decline of 1.47% in its majority Shafi’i Sunni population, dropping from 99.8% to 98.4%.The Hindu majority decreased by 4% from 84% to 81%, while the Buddhist population also saw a significant decrease and the Muslim population increased substantially.The Buddhist majority saw a 10% decrease from 84% to 75%, with increases noted in the Christian population and indigenous religions.","India's Hindu majority population experienced a decline of 7.81 per cent during the 65-year period.

'Abuse of due process of law': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's lawyers object to ED's affidavit against interim bail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abuse-of-due-process-of-law-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwals-lawyers-object-to-eds-affidavit-against-interim-bail/articleshow/109988718.cms,"NEW DELHI: Contesting ED's affidavit opposing interim bail in the Supreme Court , Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s legal team highlighted the absence of incriminating evidence after two years of investigation into the alleged liquor scam. They argued that the ED heavily relied on statements from individuals associated with the BJP, casting doubts on the impartiality of the investigation.Kejriwal’s legal team also filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Court, suggesting that the ED's affidavit is a legal violation as the case is already scheduled for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without prior approval from the SC.“Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,” AAP said in a statement.Kejriwal's arrest on March 21, 2024, just days after the announcement of general elections and during the model code of conduct, sparked allegations by the party of political ‘conspiracy’ behind the move. The AAP claimed that the arrest tilted the electoral playing field in favor of the ruling BJP, compromising the principles of free and fair elections.AAP contended that the statements provided by the witnesses followed a pattern where Kejriwal was not implicated initially, but was later named after repeated objections from the ED regarding their bail. They accused the ED of selectively ignoring statements that did not implicate Kejriwal, suggesting a bias in the investigation process. The party cited examples such as Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, facilitating his son's bail through a statement. Another person, P Sarath Reddy, allegedly transferred Rs 60 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail.AAP said that there is no evidence implicating any AAP leader in the alleged illegal activities, pointing out that the ED itself admitted Kejriwal's non-involvement in certain proceedings. The party denounced Kejriwal's arrest as a blatant disregard for due process and the rule of law.","Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s legal team highlighted the absence of incriminating evidence after two years of investigation into the alleged liquor scam.

"After West Bengal governor's video show, woman threatens suicide over identity leak",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-west-bengal-governors-video-show-woman-threatens-suicide-over-identity-leak/articleshow/109989576.cms,"KOLKATA: Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose screened CCTV footage Thursday before a select group that shows a Raj Bhavan female staffer he is accused of molesting walking out of the complex last week, prompting her to describe the disclosure of her identity without consent ""as another crime that made her even contemplate suicide"".The video of the woman between 5.33pm and 6.41pm on May 2 shows her approaching a police outpost within the compound and then leaving in a car.But it does not show anything to either corroborate or disprove the allegations.TMC ministers denounced the screening and questioned the governor's intent, specifically his stand that he would not show the video to ""(CM) Mamata Banerjee and her police"" and his earlier contention that his position gave him immunity from prosecution. Bengal women and child development minister Shashi Panja Panja announced a ""boycott"" of Bose. ""Will I sit beside him on the same dais when I know he is accused of molestation?"" Panja asked.In a text message to TOI, the complainant said: ""The governor committed a heinous act and is now trying to cover up his misdeeds by staging a farce. I was aware that Indian law mandates protecting the identity of the complainant during an investigation.""Speaking about ""contemplating suicide"", she decried the fact that her and her family's reputation was shattered because of the governor. ""He has released a video of mine without permission, thus leaving me with no choice but to take my own life. However, if a real investigation can take place, truth will come to light,"" she said. The complainant added: ""The footage shows me crying while walking towards the outpost. It shows I am walking with a person. That person had earlier snatched my bag and the governor had instructed that the person would accompany me to my home in a Raj Bhavan car and had asked me not to speak about the matter to anyone.""Minister Panja rejected Bose's assertions of immunity. ""The constitutional immunity refers to his roles as governor, not against sexual abuse. But if he misused his position, believing that abusing women is a part of the governor's responsibilities... it would be contrary to the constitutional provisions. You are not above the law,"" Panja added, announcing the ""boycott"". Raj Bhavan had arranged a viewing for 100 people after Bose announced that he wanted to show the CCTV footage to the ""citizens of Bengal"", but half of the chairs were vacant, a source said.","CCTV footage shows woman he is accused of molesting walking out of Raj Bhavan.

Close ties with neighbours are of great value: MEA Jaishankar to Maldivian counterpart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/close-ties-with-neighbours-are-of-great-value-mea-jaishankar-to-maldivian-counterpart/articleshow/109989721.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar told his visiting Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer that the world is today passing through a volatile and uncertain period and, in such times, like during Covid, natural disasters and economic difficulties, close partnerships with neighbours are of great value.“It is in our common interest that we reach an understanding on how best we take our relationship forward,” he said, as they discussed additional avenues for taking forward the ties.He recalled before Zameer that India has been a key provider of development assistance to the Maldives, including financial help on favourable terms. Maldivian Prez Mohamed Muizzu has sought leniency from India for repayment of loans taken by previous govts and the issue figured in the meeting.Thursday’s meeting between Jaishankar and Zameer took place a day before May 10 deadline set by Male for the withdrawal of Indian troops who were operating Indian naval choppers and an aircraft in the Maldives.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal confirmed later in the day that the process of appointing “competent Indian technical personnel” to keep running these aviation platforms, which are crucial for evacuation and other humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR) activities, has been completed. After some intense diplomatic negotiations , India had acquiesced to the replacement of military personnel with civilian staff.Removal of Indian military personnel dominated Muizzu’s campaign agenda in the run-up to the presidential polls and it’s significant the first high-level bilateral visit from the Maldives to India coincided with the fulfilment of his poll promise.“As close and proximate neighbours, the development of our ties is obviously based on mutual interests and reciprocal sensitivity. As far as India is concerned, these are articulated in terms of ourNeighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision ,” said Jaishankar, hoping that the meeting will enable them to strengthen convergence of perspectives in various domains.Jaishankar’s emphasis on reciprocal sensitivity is significant as it suggests the Indian Ocean neighbour cannot expect the relationship to be driven by unilateral concessions alone. Welcoming Zameer, he said the visit was an opportunity to discuss the relationship and chart out future directions.“Our projects have benefited the people of your country; contributed to the quality of life. They range from infrastructure projects and social initiatives to medical evacuation and health facilities. India has been a first responder on numerous occasions for Maldives,” said Jaishankar, adding bilateral cooperation had also enhanced the security and well-being of the Maldives through shared activities, equipment provisioning, capacity building and training."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar told his visiting Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer that the world is today passing through a volatile and uncertain period. “It is in our common interest that we reach an understanding on how best we take our relationship forward,” he said, as they discussed additional avenues for taking forward the ties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109989727,imgsize-734732,width-400,resizemode-4/109989727.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In an ongoing legal saga, the US State Department has refrained from making any statements regarding the investigation into the alleged conspiracy to assassinate Khalistani separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun . Emphasizing the need for due process, the department asserted that it would remain silent until the allegations are substantiated before a jury.Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the US state department, addressed inquiries during a briefing, highlighting the sensitivity of the matter.""There's a publicly returned indictment that contains alleged facts or allegations. Until they're proven before a jury that anyone can go and read, I won't speak to them here because, of course, it's an ongoing legal matter, and I'll leave it at that,"" he said.The case revolves around Pannun, an India-designated terrorist holding American and Canadian citizenship.The indictment filed by the US Justice Department implicates an unidentified Indian government employee in recruiting Nikhil Gupta to engage a hitman for the assassination attempt, thwarted by US authorities. However, both Indian and Russian authorities have raised skepticism regarding the evidence provided by Washington, demanding concrete proof of Indian involvement in the alleged conspiracy.Amidst these developments, the ministry of external affairs has vehemently denied any official engagement in the reported assassination plot , dismissing it as baseless speculation. Describing it as an ""unwarranted and unsubstantiated"" imputation on a ""serious matter"" that is under investigation, MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was ""speculative and irresponsible.""Meanwhile, India has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.Moreover, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said that Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the case.""According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.

"Why state Congress invited Gandhis to contest from Khammam, turning it into a hot seat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-state-congress-invited-gandhis-to-contest-from-khammam-turning-it-into-a-hot-seat/articleshow/109992258.cms,"HYDERABAD: Khammam , which was just another Telangana parliamentary constituency, became the most prestigious seat after the state Congress leadership passed resolutions urging Sonia Gandhi, later Rahul Gandhi and finally Priyanka Gandhi to contest from here.While none of the Gandhis accepted the proposal, the seat became the most sought after in Telangana with three strong ministers from the district seeking the ticket for their family members, and the Congress high command denying all three.All eyes will be on Khammam when the 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana go to the polls on May 13. Congress has not won this seat in the past 15 years but has performed exceedingly well in the assembly elections. The grand old party has fielded R Raghuram Reddy, BRS has nominated its sitting MP Nama Nageswara Rao and BJP, which is trying to expand its footprint here, has fielded Tandra Vinod Rao.The seat generated a lot of political heat with the three ministers, including deputy chief minister Bhatti Vikramarka, standing their ground firmly for a ticket to their family members. Even Telangana Congress president and chief minister A Revanth Reddy and other ministers in his cabinet went all out to request Sonia to field either Rahul or Priyanka as an escape route to avoid rubbing any of the three ministers the wrong way.Of these ministers, Bhatti belongs to the SC community, revenue minister Ponguleti Srinivas is a Reddy and agriculture minister Tummala Nageswara Rao is a Kamma, a community that is financially & politically influential in the constituency and the district.What started as an attempt by the state Congress to get one of the Gandhi family members to contest gradually turned into a difficult proposition to finalise the candidate. Both the party and CM Revanth were aiming to consolidate their positions after the party won 64 assembly seats, four more than the simple majority to form govt. Congress had won six of the seven assembly segments in Khammam, with CPI, a pre-poll ally of Congress, bagging Kothagudem, the lone seat it contested in 2023 assembly polls.Even the party high command sat on finalising the candidate for the seat for more than a month after releasing its first list of four candidates for Telangana, and announced R Raghuram Reddy's name with only a day left for the nomination. This was done after inviting Bhatt Vikramarka and Ponguleti Srinivas to Bengaluru where AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge brokered peace between them after settling the issue over phone with agriculture minister Tummala Nageswara Rao.All the three ministers assured the party leadership of working for the candidate finalised by the high command. Raghuram is the son of Ramasahayam Surender Reddy, a former Congress MP close to the Nehru-Gandhi family. Raghuram's son is married to Aashritha, daughter of actor D Venkatesh who is from Kamma community, his second son is wedded to the daughter of Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy. The grand old party is banking on Raghuram's Reddy-Kamma link and its performance of winning all the seven assembly segments along with CPI, and even the support of the CPM, to win the seat, which it had last won in 2004. Political equations have changed a lot as Ponguleti had won this seat on a YSRCP ticket in 2014, later joined BRS and is now in Congress.Though BRS failed to win a single assembly seat in this parliamentary constituency, it is confident of retaining Khammam as the party had won it in 2019 after victory in only one of the seven assembly segments in the 2018 state polls.On the other hand, BJP is expanding its footprint with top leaders like home minister Amit Shah having addressed a public meeting in the constituency. BJP leaders are confident of opening their account in Khammam, stating LS election is a different ball game and that Modi's magic, Ayodhya's Ram temple and ""double engine sarkar"" will play a role in deciding the fate of candidates.","Khammam was just another Telangana parliamentary constituency.

Old Pawar vs Vikhe Patil feud at play in Ahmednagar's NCP(SCP)-BJP contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/old-pawar-vs-vikhe-patil-feud-at-play-in-ahmednagars-ncpscp-bjp-contest/articleshow/109991906.cms,"NASHIK: On the face, it looks like an NCP (SCP) versus BJP contest in Ahmednagar but it's actually a replay of the decades-old political rivalry between the Pawars and the Vikhe Patils, which has come down to the third generation.When they were with Congress, Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Vikhe Patil , an eight-time MP from the region, were in a tussle over controlling sugarcane cooperative societies.As Pawar's stature grew within the party, he allegedly played a key role in denying Balasaheb the party ticket to contest the 1991 Lok Sabha polls. Angry, the latter fought as an Independent but lost to Congress's Yeshwantrao Gadakh. He even moved the Bombay HC, accusing Gadakh and Pawar of electoral malpractices and maligning his image.The bitter feud between the two families continued after Balasaheb's death.In the run-up to the 2019 polls, his son, Radhakrishna, lobbied hard to ensure that Congress got Ahmednagar in the seat-sharing talks with NCP (then undivided). He was keen to field his son, Sujay, but Pawar was adamant not to part with it. Sujay then joined BJP and won the seat. Days later, his father came to the saffron party's fold.In the 2024 polls, the political veterans are at it again.Radhakrishna, a state minister, even admitted at a recent campaign rally that ""the fight in Ahmednagar is between BJP and Sharad Pawar"".Pitted against Sujay, a neurosurgeon and current MP, is Nilesh Lanke who the senior Pawar has ""poached"" from his rebel nephew's faction.A couple of months after NCP suffered a vertical split last July, Sharad Pawar assigned the party's Ahmednagar district unit chief, Rajendra Phalke, the task of getting back Lanke, one of the four MLAs who had defected to Ajit Pawar's camp. ""Pawar saheb had zeroed in on the Parner legislator as the party's face for the LS seat much before his nephew broke away with a group of legislators. Considering Lanke's popularity and strong connection with voters, senior Pawar was convinced that he would be the party's best bet to wrest the constituency from BJP,"" Phalke told TOI.In the next five months, Phalke recalled, he held a series of secret meetings with Lanke. ""Senior Pawar and Lanke, too, talked over the phone. Finally, Lanke resigned as an MLA and joined NCP (SCP) in the last week of March.""Despite the constituency being a BJP stronghold since 2009, the contest this time will be a tough one, a local BJP politician said. ""Lanke is giving sleepless nights to Sujay, unlike in 2019, when the latter had a cakewalk against NCP nominee Sangram Jagtap.""Senior Vikhe Patil, a prominent face in BJP state unit, has skipped campaigning elsewhere and is focusing on his son's victory. Not lagging far behind is Sharad Pawar, who has already held three rallies and is slated to address at least a couple more before the constituency goes to the polls on May 13.Amid this neck and neck race, Sujay recently stoked a controversy after he targeted Lanke for the latter's inability to speak fluently in English and Hindi. ""One should know how to speak in English or Hindi to raise issues in Parliament. I challenge my opponent (Lanke) to speak fluently in these two languages. I am ready to give him a month,"" he said at a rally.Lanke shot back and said he was proud of his mother tongue Marathi. ""Hard work beats money and muscle,"" he wrote on X.One of the main grievances against Sujay is that after becoming an MP in 2019, he remained ""inaccessible"" not only to voters but also to his own party cadres. ""Sujay has alienated a section of party cadres who toiled hard to ensure his victory five years ago. This time, many of them are not working for him wholeheartedly,"" another BJP politician said.Also, there are internal squabbles within the party's district unit. In March, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis had to intervene to end the acrimony between Ahmednagar BJP MLC Ram Shinde, and the father-son duo. Shinde blamed the Vikhe Patils for his defeat in Karjat-Jamkhed in the 2019 assembly polls. Opposing Sujay's candidature, the working committee member of the state BJP's SC and OBC Morcha, Sunil Rasne, resigned from his post.In contrast, Lanke has been helping villagers with their health and education needs through his NGO. His loyalists say he takes people's calls even at odd hours. ""During the pandemic, Lanke had set up a Covid care centre with more than 1,000 beds at Parner. The patients were provided free treatment and food. This pushed his popularity among villagers,"" a close associate of Lanke said.For his part, Lanke said he is not wealthy like his opponent, but he has the blessings of people. ""Sujay has not done anything to provide water to villages and neither has he implemented any development projects. There is resentment against him.""It is BJP's organisational strength that could work to Sujay's advantage. Its two allies, NCP and Shiv Sena, too, have large pockets of followers in the constituency.","Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Vikhe Patil were in a tussle over controlling sugarcane cooperative societies. In the run-up to the 2019 polls, Radhakrishna lobbied hard to ensure that Congress got Ahmednagar in the seat-sharing talks with NCP.

But I want to tell (Telangana CM) Revanth Reddy that this time around we are going to win more than 10 seats. This double-digit score is going to make Modi-ji cross the 400 mark,” Shah said.Shah alleged that Congress , BRS and AIMIM want to run Telangana based on Sharia and the Quran. Referring to the three parties as a “triangle of appeasement”, Shah alleged: “Congress and BRS cannot stop AIMIM. These parties don’t let the Ram Navami procession take place and they also oppose CAA. These leaders don’t even allow the celebration of Hyderabad Liberation Day (Sept 17).”He added that if BJP gets more than 10 seats in Telangana, it would end reservation for Muslims in the state and share the benefits among SCs, STs and OBCs.Alleging that Congress is using lies to fight the election, he said, “They are saying that if Modi comes, he will remove reservation. He was in power with a full majority for the previous two terms and did not remove reservation.”“However, in Telangana, the Congress govt granted 4% reservation to Muslims by plundering SC, ST, and OBC quotas,” Shah claimed. TOI had reported earlier that the 4% reservation in the two Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is over and above the reservation for the other castes and is included in Backward Classes (E) category.“Rahul baba’s guarantee will not survive even until sunset. Congress does not keep commitments. PM Modi ensured that the Ram mandir was built within five years, whereas Congress delayed this issue for 70 years.

Minorities thriving in India: EAC-PM paper,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minorities-thriving-in-india-eac-pm-paper/articleshow/109990006.cms,"NEW DELHI: A report by Economic Advisory Council to the PM has said that minorities are thriving in India, and not just protected, arguing that the share of the majority population has declined in the country between 1950 and 2015.A paper by Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose and Apurv Kumar Mishra said the share of Hindus in the country’s population decreased 7.8% between 1950 and 2015 — from 84.7% to 78.1%.Without giving the absolute numbers, it argued that the share of Muslims increased over 43% — from 9.8% in 1950 to 14.1% in 2015.The paper titled ‘Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)’ also said the share of Jains decreased from 0.4% in 1950 to 0.3%.According to the paper, the share of Christians rose from 2.2% to 2.4%— an increase of 5.4% between 1950 and 2015. While the share of Sikhs increased from 1.2% in 1950 to 1.9% in 2015, an increase of 6.6%, the share of Parsis declined 85%, falling from 0.03% in 1950 to 0.004% in 2015.The data indicated that “there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in society”, the paper said, adding that it was not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approachThe paper noted that a decrease in the share of the majority population and a consequent increase in the share of minorities suggests that the net result of all policy actions, political decisions and societal processes is to provide a conducive environment for increasing diversity in society.The analysis, however, came under scrutiny with the Population Foundation of India (PFI) saying, “The study’s focus on changes in the share of majority and minority religious groups globally over a 65-year period should not be used to incite fear or discrimination against any community.”It said the decadal growth rate for Muslims has been slowing for three decades. “Specifically, the decadal growth rate for Muslims decreased from 32.9% in 1981-1991 to 24.6% in 2001-2011. The decline is more pronounced than that of Hindus, whose growth rate fell from 22.7% to 16.8% over the same period. The census data is available from 1951 to 2011 and is quite similar to the data in this study, indicating these numbers aren’t new,” PFI said in a statement.",Economic Advisory Council to the PM says minorities are thriving in India.

NEW DELHI: The upcoming clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) pits two teams against each other, each fighting for survival in the tournament. RCB , after a dismal start, has mounted a remarkable comeback, securing three consecutive victories and climbing to the seventh spot in the IPL 2024 points table . Despite their resurgence, their path to the playoffs remains challenging, as they need to win all their remaining three fixtures to stand a chance.Similarly, Punjab Kings find themselves in a precarious position, occupying the eighth spot with the same number of points as RCB.With both teams vying for a spot in the playoffs, the upcoming match holds significant importance. Only one team can potentially reach the crucial 14-point mark, and RCB, buoyed by their recent wins and a previous victory against Punjab Kings, enter the contest with a sense of confidence.Also see: IPL live score Punjab Kings holds a marginally better head-to-head record against RCB in their IPL encounters, winning 17 out of 32 matches compared to RCB's 15 victories. However, RCB turned the tables in their most recent clash this season, powered by Virat Kohli 's 77 and Dinesh Karthik's explosive 28* off just 10 balls.Also see: IPL match result Moving to the venue, the HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala has hosted 12 IPL matches since March 2010. Known for its bounce-friendly pitches favoring fast bowlers and providing ample opportunities for batsmen, the average first innings total stands at a high-scoring 179. However, in the recent match between CSK and Punjab Kings, CSK managed 167 runs in their innings. Spinners took center stage in that game, with Rahul Chahar and Ravindra Jadeja both bagging impactful three-wicket hauls.In IPL 2024, the HPCA Stadium has hosted one match so far. In this solitary match, the team batting first emerged victorious, while no team managed to chase successfully. The average first innings total in this season stands at 167 runs, while the average second innings total is 139 runs. The highest total recorded at the venue was 167/9 by Chennai Super Kings against Punjab Kings, whereas the lowest total was 139/9 by Punjab Kings against Chennai Super Kings. These stats suggest that the pitch at the HPCA Stadium in IPL 2024 has favoured the team batting first.Considering the recent trends, spinners are likely to play a crucial role in the upcoming clash. Captains from both teams may opt to include at least two specialist spinners in their playing XI. Additionally, a strong batting line up will be crucial given the historically high-scoring nature of the pitch at Dharamshala.Virat Kohli has been in scintillating form, currently holding the IPL 2024 Orange Cap with 542 runs in 11 innings. His last encounter with Punjab Kings saw him scoring a brilliant 77 runs, undoubtedly boosting his confidence ahead of facing them again.He has been impressive, amassing 315 runs in 11 matches. Notably, he has played crucial innings in two 60-plus scores, both resulting in successful 200-plus run-chases for Punjab Kings. His quickfire knocks of 61* off 29 balls against Gujarat Titans and 68* off 28 balls against KKR were instrumental in his team's victories.He has been a standout performer, claiming 17 wickets in 11 matches in IPL 2024. He has already secured three three-wicket hauls this season, placing him second in the race for the IPL 2024 Purple Cap . Patel's consistent performances have been vital for Punjab Kings, bolstering their bowling attack and contributing significantly to their campaign.Sam Curran (c), Matthew Short, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Kagiso Rabada, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Chris Woakes, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajan, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw.Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.Dinesh Karthik, Jonny BairstowVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, Shashank Singh: Sam Curran, Cameron Green, Will JacksHarshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Mohammed Siraj","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings face each other in IPL 2024.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson's valiant effort of 86 runs off 46 balls, which included six sixes and eight boundaries, was not enough to secure a victory against Delhi Capitals. Nevertheless, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the race for the IPL 2024 purple cap.His dismissal in the 16th over, which sparked controversy due to a close call on the boundary line, led to Rajasthan finishing at 201-8, suffering their third loss of the season.Despite the defeat, Rajasthan Royals remain in second place on the points table with 16 points, behind leaders Kolkata Knight Riders on net run-rate. Delhi Capitals, with 12 points, are now tied with three other teams - Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants - as the race for the playoffs intensifies.The turning point of the match came when Shai Hope took a brilliant catch on the edge of the boundary at long-on to dismiss Samson. The Rajasthan captain exchanged words with the on-field umpires after the television umpire, Michael Gough, declared him out, as replays from one angle suggested that Hope might have touched the boundary line.Following Samson's dismissal, Rajasthan's run-chase faltered, losing five wickets for just 39 runs, with left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (2-25) striking twice in one over to seal the game for the home team.In the Purple Cap tally, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the top 10 after their impressive performances in Delhi Capitals' win over Rajasthan Royals. Mukesh currently occupies the sixth position with 15 wickets in eight matches, while Kuldeep, with 14 wickets, takes the eighth spot in the bowlers' leaderboard.SEE ALSO: IPL 2024 Orange Cap Standings Jasprit Bumrah continues to lead the Purple Cap table with 18 wickets in 12 matches, despite taking only one wicket against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings and KKR's Varun Chakaravarthy follow closely behind with 17 and 16 wickets, respectively.T Natarajan of Sunrisers Hyderabad has slipped from the top-three to fourth position with 15 wickets, while Arshdeep Singh of Punjab Kings rounds out the top five with 15 wickets as well.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth a total of $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109940827,imgsize-31764,width-400,resizemode-4/109940827.jpg"
