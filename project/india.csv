Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours.

NEW DELHI: The criminal justice system is set for a major overhaul with the three new criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - coming into force on Monday, replacing the British-era Indian Penal Code , Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act .Starting Monday, all FIRs will be registered under the provisions of BNS.However, all cases registered before July 1 will continue to be tried under IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act until final disposal.BNS has 358 sections, down from 511 in IPC. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC, duration of imprisonment extended in 41 crimes, fines increased in 82 crimes, minimum punishment introduced in 25 crimes, community service introduced as penalty in six crimes and 19 sections removed.BNSS has 531 sections as against 484 in CrPC, with changes in 177 sections, addition of nine sections and 39 sub-sections and deletion of 14 sections. The Indian Evidence Act, with 166 sections, is being replaced with BSA having 170 sections, with change in 24 sections, addition of two new sub-sections and deletion of six sections.BNS, BNSS and BSA are being implemented six months after they were enacted based on protracted and detailed consultations with all stakeholders including SC and HC judges, governors, chief ministers, civil servants, police officers, collectorates and Members of Parliament and legislative assemblies. Around 3,200 suggestions were received and examined over several rounds of talks, with home minister Amit Shah having taken 158 such meetings, leading to the drafting of a whole new set ofcriminal laws that seek to leverage technology to make India's criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world. The BNS, BNSS and BSA bills were referred to a parliamentary standing committee and most of its recommendations were accepted by the govt before bringing the bills to Parliament for approval.The underlying spirit of the new criminal laws , as PM Modi had stated at the All-India DGPs conference in Jan, is ""citizen first, dignity first and justice first"", with emphasis on the 'danda' (baton) being replaced by 'data' as a policing tool.While replying to the debate in Parliament on BNS, BNSS and BSA bills, Shah had underlined that the focus of the new laws was on justice delivery, while safeguarding the rights of victims as well as accused, rather than on punishment. Also, the colonial mindset apparent behind ordering of IPC sections - with those dealing with 'rajdroh' (treason) preceding ones related to serious offences like 'murder' and 'rape' - was being done away with.Under the , a person may report crime online, without having to visit a police station (online FIR) and also file a zero-FIR at any police station. A free copy of the FIR will be provided to the victim. In the event of arrest, the individual will have the right to inform a person of his choice. Arrest details will need to be prominently displayed within police stations and district headquarters.The new laws prioritise investigation for offences against women and children, ensuring timely completion within two months of recording information. Victims shall be entitled to updates on the progress of their case within 90 days.Courts may now grant a maximum of two adjournments to avoid unnecessary delays in case hearings.","Three new criminal laws come into force on Monday. They replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Evidence Act. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC. The focus of the new laws is on justice delivery, rather than punishment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111387623,imgsize-932258,width-400,resizemode-4/111387623.jpg"

The CM faces pressure from several legislators, led by seniors Vinay Kulkarni and P M Narendra Swamy, to overhaul his council of ministers. Around 40 MLAs are waiting to replace non-performing ministers.On Sunday, Shivakumar met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi, while Siddaramaiah met party MP Rahul Gandhi the day before.""Kharge, Siddaramaiah, and I have arrived at a decision on how to work in interest of the party,"" Shivakumar said. ""There is no need for any minister, MLA, or any individual to talk about it in public. If any functionary continues to talk to the media about the CM or deputy CM posts, then it would be inevitable for both AICC and KPCC to take disciplinary action.""Both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar issued strict instructions to their supporters to refrain from making public statements on the CM and deputy CM issues. The central brass has also decided to send veteran Madhusudan Mistry to review Congress' performance in Karnataka in Lok Sabha polls and gather legislators' opinions on the leadership dispute.The state unit is planning to send a fact-finding team to all 28 parliamentary constituencies. ""The objective is to hear from all quarters about prevailing issues and restore discipline to prepare the party to face a series of polls ahead,"" said KPCC working president GC Chandrashekhar.Shivakumar's opponents have called for his replacement as Congress state president, citing the party's ""one man, one position"" principle. Shivakumar currently serves both as deputy CM and state party president.However, Shivakumar's brother and former MP DK Suresh dismissed these demands, suggesting that those calling for his resignation should either ""put up or shut up"". Suresh referred to former chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde, who dissolved govt and called for early elections after a poor performance in LS polls, challenging those seeking positions to lead the party to victory before claiming privileges.","Congress high command has intervened, issuing a stern warning to maintain discipline.

Commissioned into the J&K Rifles in 1984, he had a two-year tenure as the GoC-in-C of the crucial Northern Command before becoming the vice-chief in Feb this year. ""While China has mastered salami-slicing and grey zone warfare, Pakistan continues with its proxy war,"" a top official said.In a statement announcing Gen Dwivedi's taking over the top post, the Army said, ""The global geo-strategic environment remains dynamic, with the challenges in the security domain becoming more pronounced due to technological advancements and ever-changing character of modern warfare.""""Operational preparedness to counter security threats to a rising nation, therefore would figure prominently, as a key focus area for the chief. Concurrently, a focused response strategy to myriad non-traditional security challenges, too, shall be a priority towards augmenting the nation's defence,"" it said.Gen Dwivedi will have to push hard to fast-track modernisation and transformation of the Army during his two-year tenure.Despite emergency procurements, the force is still grappling with major operational voids in several areas, ranging from modern air defence weapons and fourth-generation anti-tank guided missiles to attack and light utility helicopters and night-fighting capabilities.This is especially critical for the Northern and Eastern Commands along the 3,488-km LAC. There are 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese troops with heavy weaponry deployed along the western (Ladakh) and central sectors (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC. China has upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) as well, with another 90,000 soldiers deployed there.Then, there is the entire question of the short-term recruitment of soldiers under the controversial Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022. The armed forces want the retention rate of Agniveers to be raised from the existing 25% after their four-year tenures to at least 50%.","Gen Dwivedi will have to push hard to fast-track modernisation and transformation of the Army during his two-year tenure.

The meeting is significant as it is the first time that the Taliban are attending the talks.However, the UN has denied that the latest round of talks in Doha are meant to pave the way for international recognition for the Taliban.The conference has also come under strong criticism from rights groups for not engaging Afghan women and civil society members.India is being represented in the meeting by MEA joint secretary of the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran (PAI) division J P Singh. The official, who visited Kabul in March this year, also met Taliban leaders in Doha.India continues to tread carefully on the Taliban, as it works closely with them for Afghanistan’s humanitarian needs and its own security needs but without doing anything that might be seen as a step towards official recognition for the regime in Kabul.The conference in Doha is also seeing participation by the EU, OIC and SCO, the Eurasian bloc which will be hosting its summit meeting this week in Astana, where one of the main focus areas again will be the situation in Afghanistan. With PM Narendra Modi skipping participation, although he may still address it virtually on July 4, foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent India at the SCO summit Both in Doha and Astana, government will look to further hammer its point that as a contiguous neighbor, India has legitimate economic and security interests in Afghanistan, and that the international community must focus on combating terrorism, humanitarian assistance, formation of a truly inclusive government and preserving the rights of women, girls and minorities. The focus on girls and women is important as the Taliban continue to deny them access to schools and colleges, in line with their interpretation of Islamic laws.Securing its investments in Afghanistan is also a priority for India as it working on close to 500 projects in the country spread across all 34 provinces in areas like power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education and agriculture. In all, India has invested more than $ 3 billion in Afghanistan.Ensuring that Afghan territory is not used for sheltering terrorists or financing terrorist acts, however, tops the list of Indian priorities. This is particularly so in the case of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council, including those belonging to Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. India will look to again make the point that any instability in Afghanistan is a threat to the whole region.","India is among the 25 countries participating in the third UN-led conference on Afghanistan in Doha.

Three new criminal laws coming into force across India on July 1: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-new-criminal-laws-coming-into-force-across-india-on-july-1-what-it-means/articleshow/111385520.cms,"Zero FIR: Allowing people to file an FIR at any police station, regardless of jurisdiction, to eliminate delays in initiating legal proceedings.

Online registration of police complaints and electronic service of summons.

Mandatory videography of crime scenes for all heinous crimes to strengthen investigations.

Summonses can be served electronically, expediting legal processes, reducing paperwork, and ensuring efficient communication among all parties involved.

Faster justice delivery, with judgments required within 45 days of trial completion and charges framed within 60 days of first hearing.

Sensitive handling of crimes against women and children, including recording victim statements by female officers and faster medical reports.

New provisions to address emerging crimes like false promise of marriage, gang rape of minors, and mob lynching.

Definition of terrorism for the first time, with expanded scope to include ""economic security"" of the country.

Reduction in the number of sections from 511 in IPC to 358 in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

Merging of overlapping sections and simplification of language

Criticism by opposition



The new laws significantly expand the maximum duration of police custody from 15 days to 60-90 days, increasing the risk of police excesses and coerced evidence.

The laws give police officers broad discretion to choose whether to prosecute under the new laws or the existing UAPA, without clear guidelines.

The new laws introduce vaguely worded offences related to ""terrorism"", ""organized crime"", and ""acts endangering sovereignty"", which can be arbitrarily applied.

The definition of ""terrorism"" is expanded beyond the existing UAPA to include acts that ""disturb public order"" or ""destabilize the country"", giving wide scope for misuse.

The expanded police powers and vague offences pose a threat to fundamental rights like freedom of speech and personal liberty.

The removal of the legal aid provision from the point of arrest is seen as particularly problematic for protecting the rights of the accused.

NEW DELHI: The three new criminal laws - the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita , and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam -- which will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act, respectively, will come into effect from July 1 , 2024.The new laws, which were passed by the previous NDA government, aims to modernise India's criminal justice system by incorporating provisions such as:The laws aim to prioritise justice and fairness over just punishment, with an Indian ethos, as opposed to the colonial-era laws, Union home minister Amit Shah had said in Lok Sabha when the laws were being debated.The government recently said that extensive preparations, including training programs and technological upgrades, have been undertaken to ensure smooth implementation of these new criminal laws across the country.Though the new laws have been widely hailed as much-needed update to the Colonial-era legislations, the opposition has cited several issues.","The three new criminal laws will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act.

BJP's counterattack plan

What INDIA bloc is demanding



NEW DELHI: The second week of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, which is set to begin from Monday, is likely to witness heated debates and fiery exchanges between the BJP-led NDA government and opposition bloc INDIA on issues ranging from the NEET-NET paper leaks row to Agnipath scheme, inflation, and unemployment .The opposition, led by the Congress, is pressing for a dedicated discussion on the paper leaks controversy, but the government seems to want to focus the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address first.While in the Lok Sabha, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has accused the Congress of wanting to ""run away"" from a discussion on NEET and asserted the government is ready for any type of discussion; Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar has said he was ""constrained"" to not accept the opposition's notices for a discussion under Rule 267 on NEET, as the President's address debate was the priority.The BJP will be initiating the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with Anurag Thakur and Sudhanshu Trivedi as the first speakers respectively. In Lok Sabha, the motion will be seconded by first-time MP Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of late BJP leader Sushma Swaraj.The Lok Sabha has allocated 16 hours for the debate on the Motion of Thanks, which will conclude with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply on Tuesday. In the Rajya Sabha, 21 hours have been allotted for the debate, with the PM likely to reply on Wednesday.This allows the NDA to set the agenda in Parliament initially in the week.Several media reports citing sources have also suggested that the BJP has compiled an action-taken list against those responsible for NEET anomalies and the government's commitment to CBI investigation of the matter.Many reports also indicate that the BJP plans to ""expose the Opposition"" on issues like corruption and the recent hooch tragedy in Tamil Nadu to counter the NEET allegations. It is expected that the BJP-led NDA will target the DMK government over the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy and the TMC over post-poll violence in West Bengal, to hold the opposition accountable for their ""selective outrage"".The opposition INDIA bloc has been vocal in its demand for a discussion on the NEET paper leak issue, with Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Rajya Sabha LoP Mallikarjun Kharge leading the charge.However, the government has so far refused to provide a separate discussion on this, asking the opposition to raise it during the debate on the Motion of Thanks.The Congress has tried to put pressure on the government by holding nationwide protests demanding justice for students affected by the NEET irregularities. It has also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the alleged malpractices, paper leaks, inflated marks, and other irregularities in the NEET-UG 2024 exam.The INDIA bloc has also calling for the removal of the National Testing Agency (NTA) chairman, who the Congress alleges is responsible for the NEET irregularities.The opposition is also likely to corner the government on rising prices and the state of the economy.","The second week of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, which is set to begin from Monday, is likely to witness heated debates and fiery exchanges.

The party urged that the bill be brought in the next session of Parliament and asked PM Narendra Modi to clear his stand on the issue.The demand came a day after NDA constituent JD(U) passed a resolution at its national executive meeting urging the Centre to put Bihar's law pertaining to reservations under the Constitution's Ninth Schedule to rule out judicial review of the quota increase beyond 50% in the state.In a post on X on Sunday, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh questioned the silence of BJP, JD(U)'s ally in the state and at the Centre. He said putting reservation laws beyond the 50% cap in the Ninth Schedule was not a solution, because according to a 2007 SC decision, such laws were also subject to judicial review.Ramesh said the current limit of 50% was not explicitly mandated by the Constitution, but was decided through various SC decisions. He went on to say that in such a situation, a bill to amend the Constitution was the only way out and this was something the Congress had promised in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls and remained committed to.Ramesh asked whether the PM would ""clear his stand""?

The school, which should be a sanctuary of learning, became an arena of judgment... This is the plight of my daughter, a plight shared by many, often silenced by the shadows of ignorance.These are excerpts from a letter to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma by a Guwahati woman after photos of her 17-year-old transgender daughter in a swimming pool in a bikini, posted on her social media platform, forced her to leave the school last month.While the mother has slammed the principal of the reputed co-educational school in Guwahati for ""slandering"", ""belittling"" and ""mocking"" her daughter and ""targeting her truth and her very being"", school authorities said the photographs ""expressed vulgarity"" and all that they had asked for was to have the posts removed from social media.As the world celebrated June as Pride Month, photos of the transgender girl in a bikini, clicked during a family vacation on June 9 and posted on social media, became not just a flashpoint between the school and her family but also put a question mark on the issue of gender inclusivity in educational institutions in India.The family has asked Sarma for a slew of changes - from embracing diversity with gender-inclusive uniform in schools to extending protection against bullying and harassment.Also, the state's Transgender Welfare Board has moved Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (ASCPCR), saying ""nobody can sexualise a child's body and a photo"".On June 26, ASCPCR began hearings in the case, with the transgender girl's family narrating the incident. ""We heard the complainant and would now summon school authorities. After hearing both the parties, we would convene on a specific date. Thereafter, legal action would be initiated,"" commission chairperson Shyamal Prasad Saikia said.On June 10, a day after the transgender girl posted the photos, the school principal called the parents at 9pm. ""'Your daughter is disgusting and shameful. Come tomorrow and take her out of my school...' this is what the principal told me,"" the student's mother recounted the call.The family opted for a transfer from the school rather than what they said was ""capitulating to infringement on her right to exist"".School management said they have taken care of the 17-year-old student and counselled her throughout besides protecting her from bullying by some students.The principal said after she posted the photographs in swimsuit ""expressing vulgarity"", the school earned a ""bad name"" among academia and that the school could not tolerate ""such behaviour"". He said the school never intended to target her and had merely asked her to remove the posts.However, the student's family hurled allegations at the school, saying the issue of bikini photos was an excuse to get her out of school. They alleged that she became a target because of her gender. ""The school doesn't find similar photos posted by boys disgusting or shameful. It indicates their sick mentality,"" the mother said.In the letter to Assam CM, which later went viral on social media, the student's mother said, ""My daughter, with dreams as vast as the Brahmaputra, has faced the heights of discrimination and prejudice. Yet, she stands unwavering, aspiring to contribute to society...""""The phone call at night from the principal was a stark reminder of the battles we still face. Her social media, a space of personal expression, was scrutinised and slandered. A family pool outing, a moment of innocent joy, was twisted into a weapon of shame just because my daughter wore a bikini,"" the letter said.""We asked for a transfer certificate from the school after she was shamed and subjected to mental harassment. We decided to keep her away from such a toxic environment,"" her mother said, adding that the family wants a public apology from the school. Now, she might have to forfeit an entire academic year as she was issued the transfer certificate amid the ongoing session.State Transgender Welfare Board president Rituparna Neog said, ""In the explanation given to us, the school's view is that the photos were sexually explicit. I have forwarded this to ASCPCR, with the point that nobody can sexualise a child's body and photos."" Neog is also a member of the National Council for Transgender Persons.The principal told TOI that the message was clearly communicated to the family. ""Body piercing, tattooing are against our rules. Posting obscene photos on social media is not desired. We told them they could delete the photos and start behaving properly or withdraw the student from the school,"" he said.""I am delighted that transgenders will now raise their voice for liberty and fairness.

A police team is working on identifying them.A police note said the first officer arrested, Lt Commander Vipin Dagar (28), would prepare forged documents, forward them to the South Korean consulate in Mumbai and visit it on Jyoti's instructions. Both officers were posted in Western Naval Command, which has its headquarters in Mumbai.Two others, Ravi Kumar and Deepak Dogra, have been arrested from J&K and are being brought to Mumbai, police said. Police said Kumar wanted to leave for South Korea on a visa acquired through forged documents, while Dogra appears to have been monitoring the overall operation and identifying potential targets.All arrested accused have been sent to police custody till July 5. They have been booked for cheating, forgery, breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy under IPC as well as relevant sections under Passport Act.Police have seized 14 passports, documents of four fictitious companies, fake rubber stamps, stamp papers, various certificates, and three bank accounts with a balance of a little over Rs 2 crore. An examination of Jyoti's bank account showed that he had accumulated Rs 1.6 crore in the last eight years, which was beyond his known sources of income.Investigations showed that the gang would entice people seeking opportunities abroad, particularly in South Korea, to apply for visas even if they were ineligible. The two naval officers would visit the consulate in Mumbai in uniform, claiming to be close relatives of the applicants, to ensure that certain discrepancies were overlooked, said police. They even forced the consulate employees to expedite visa applications, they added.Police said Teji (26) had established a fictitious company, Tosha International, through which she would send people abroad.","Mumbai police crime branch probing human smuggling to South Korea has arrested a second naval officer and suspected kingpin of the racket.

Political reaction

NEW DELHI: A disturbing video has surfaced on social media, showing a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.The assault, captured in the video, showed the woman being repeatedly struck until she was barely conscious and unable to resist. Shockingly, onlookers present at the scene do not intervene to help the victims.The video, shared widely on social media platforms, drew condemnation from political figures including BJP's Amit Malviya and CPI(M)'s Mohammed Salim.They criticized the safety of women under the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal , identifying the assailant as a local TMC leader nicknamed 'JCB' allegedly named Tajemul by the CPI(M) state secretary.Following the brutal assault on the woman, Tajemul is also seen in the video assaulting another man who was lying on the ground. Some people from the crowd reportedly assisted in making the man kneel so that Tajemul could continue his attack.Reports suggest that the incident occurred during an 'Insaf Sabha' organized by Tajemul, reminiscent of a Taliban-style 'quick justice' forum. The meeting allegedly convened to address allegations of an extramarital affair involving the victims, who were also fined as part of the so-called arbitration.Local sources cited by TV9 Bangla identified the woman as a married resident of the village, accused of having an extramarital affair with the man assaulted alongside her. The victims reportedly did not receive immediate medical attention after the assault.West Bengal Police have taken action in the case. Islampur Police Superintendent Joby Thomas K confirmed PTI that the police have registered a case upon verifying the video circulating on social media.""We have initiated raids to apprehend the perpetrator and are swiftly investigating the motive behind this reprehensible act,"" Joby Thomas K said.The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties BJP and CPI(M) accusing the TMC of orchestrating what they describe as ""bulldozer justice"" under chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's administration.BJP's social media head Malviya condemned the incident, highlighting broader concerns about law and order under the TMC regime.He said, “India must wake up to the reality of Sharia Courts in TMC run West Bengal. There is a Sandeshkhali in every village and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a curse for women. There is no semblance of law and order in Bengal. Will Mamata Banerjee act against this monster or defend him like she stood up for Sheikh Shahjahan?”He called on the National Commission for Women (NCW) to intervene and criticized Mamata Banerjee for what he described as systemic issues of governance in West Bengal.CPI(M) West Bengal state secretary Mohammed Salim echoed these sentiments, criticizing the state government for failing to uphold justice and women's safety. He referred to the incident as worse than a ""Kangaroo Court"" scenario, demanding accountability from the administration.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also weighed in on a separate incident, condemning an alleged assault on a minority woman in Cooch Behar. ""Attacks on women, irrespective of their caste, are unacceptable... Elections have been held, results have been declared, and the ruling party has won the maximum seats in the state, so why is the government resorting to violence in the state? Nowhere in the country are we seeing such cases as are seen in Bengal after the elections? No one has the right to exercise violence against women,"" Chowdhury said.Local TMC MLA Hamidur Rahman, however, has distanced himself from the accused, characterizing the incident as a local matter unrelated to the party.TMC district president Kaniyalal Agarwal attributed the assault to disapproval within the community regarding the couple's alleged relationship. He said the alleged illicit relationship ""did not go down well with the villagers"".TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen condemned the incident but also pointed out that such kangaroo courts were common during the Left Front regime too.","A video shows a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.

VADODARA: The chairman of a reputable private school in Gujarat's Godhra was arrested Sunday in the NEET-UG malpractice case being investigated by CBI, making him the sixth suspect to be taken into custody in the state and the fourth person linked to an educational institute after the school's principal, a teacher and an academic consultant.Dixit Patel , who heads the Jay Jalaram Education Trust, stands accused of seeking Rs 10 lakh each from willing medical aspirants in return for helping them clear NEET-UG through unfair means.Jay Jalaram School was one of the designated NEET-UG centres in Panchmahal for the May 5 test, just as Oasis School in Hazaribag, whose principal and vice-principal are in CBI custody.A CBI team arrested Dixit Patel, chairman of a reputable private school in Godhra, in Anand and drove 86km to Godhra, where he was produced in a court with a remand plea. The magistrate asked the agency to seek his remand from the special CBI court in Ahmedabad.Dixit's arrest came days after CBI sought and received custody of the four people arrested by police in the initial days of the investigation. A CBI team has been camping in Gujarat to connect the dots in the NEET-UG paper leak case investigation that started in Bihar and Jharkhand before evidence emerged in other states, including Maharashtra and UP, of a larger conspiracy involving paper leak rackets entrenched across the country.The Godhra case was registered on May 8, three days after the exam, against five people based on information that they had helped 27 medical aspirants cheat. All five were charged with criminal conspiracy , cheating and criminal breach of trust under sections of the IPC.The arrested suspects include Vadodara-based education consultant Parshuram Roy, Jay Jalaram School principal Purushottam Sharma, teacher Tushar Bhatt, and alleged middlemen Vibhor Anand and Arif Vohra.On June 23, CBI filed a fresh FIR in the case under IPC sections 120B and 420, among others as protests erupted countrywide.

PANAJI: Goa police have said in a report to the state chief secretary that they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family in order to help Mumbai resident Pooja Sharma, a senior intelligence officer's wife, get the property vacated , reported.Besides instructing them to not take any action against Pooja, the report said the DGP threatened Anjuna police officers that if the ""demolition work"" was not allowed to continue they would have to ""face the consequences"".The report said when Anjuna police tried to stop the demolition, ""the DGP started shouting"" and said it should be demolished at any cost. He also instructed them that ""if any person is obstructing the demolition they should be brought to the police station"".In a chronology of events that transpired on June 22, the report said at 2.32pm, Anjuna police got a call from Panaji police control room that a person needs their help as “some persons are demolishing his house near Ganga tiles factory at Assagao”.Anjuna police sub-inspectors (PSIs) Sanket Pokhare and Nitin Naik rushed to the spot and found an excavator was demolishing the house — ground plus one floor. Pradeep Agarwadekar and his family, who were present on the spot, claimed that they were inside the house when they started demolishing.“Pokhare told the people to stop the demolition work, while asking the Agarwadekars to produce the documents of the house. He also directed the excavator operator to bring the vehicle to the police station,” the report said.While Anjuna police were carrying out their duty, they got a call from the DGP, “asking why the work of demolition of the house has been stopped”. When he was apprised about the situation, the report said, he got angry and said, “there was nobody inside the house when the demolition work was going as he has personally verified it”.The report said the DGP was pressurising Anjuna police to “take the occupants of the house to the police station and to allow the demolition work to continue”. Instead, Anjuna police instructed the Agarwadekars to come to the station and lodge a complaint.Pradeep Agarwadekar’s wife Prinsha along with her daughter came to the police station, while her husband and son stayed back at the site.The report said while they were at the police station, a person Arshad Khawaja came and told police that he was demolishing the house “as per the instructions from the top officer”. He told them that they would have received a phone call from the top officer.Khawaja also told them that he had received instructions to start the work again and said they could get in touch with him if they had any doubts. “Khawaja shared his mobile number.”The owner of the excavator, Ashley Rodrigues, also went to the police station and said Khawaja had told him that he has “contacts with top officials and that he (Khawaja) will manage all things on the spot”.The DGP called Anjuna police again and directed that “anyhow the work of demolition of the house must take place and no one should stop the work… to allow Arshad Khawaja to continue demolishing the house”.The Anjuna police report also said DGP Singh told them “Pooja Sharma is the owner of the property, and no cognisable offence is made out into the complaint of Prinsha Agarwadekar.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Unveiling Kerala's Unique Duryodhan Temple: A Taxpaying Tribute to Mahabharat's Arch Villain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

Nawazuddin Siddiqui comes out in support of Ranveer Singh as Jim Sarbh and Prashant Narayanan undermine his acting process for ‘Padmaavat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/nawazuddin-siddiqui-comes-out-in-support-of-ranveer-singh-as-jim-sarbh-and-prashant-narayanan-undermine-his-acting-process-for-padmaavat/articleshow/111348437.cms,"Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh Spotted Hand-in-Hand at Mumbai Airport

We frequently hear stories of actors who become overly committed to a part and struggle to let go of it. Ranveer Singh is one of those actors who shared this story. He revealed that the character of Allaudin Khilji in the film ‘ Padmaavat ’ was so dark and complicated that he was frightened he would fall into a deep pit from which he could never come out.He had disclosed that, in order to get ready for the part, he would shut himself up in his Goregaon house, where he was completely empty.But recently, in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, actor Prashant Narayanan questioned Ranveer's methodology. He said, “Woh jhoot bol raha hai. Yeh dark spaces mein jana, yeh sab karna yeh bakwas ki baatein hai.”Now, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer. He yelled aggressively, ""It's about Narayanan's remarks from a conversation with Shubankar Mishra.""Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has been in the profession for years and is considered one of the finest actors of his generation, has spoken up in Ranveer’s support. When he was questioned about Narayanan’s recent remarks in a conversation with Shubankar Mishra, he angrily said, “The people who are calling it fake, did they bother to understand the actor’s process? Did they bother to understand how he was living his life when he was creating the character? They are simply judging him. We don’t know what a man is thinking when he’s coming up with a characterisation.”He further added, “They think it is pretentious. When you dive deep into a character, it is a very painful process. This is a very irresponsible thing to say. If there was no process, then what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight would not be possible… That man was extremely serious about his performance and that is why he excelled in the character; that’s how iconic characters are born. If we are going to take (the process) casually, then you’ll end up with people just blurting out dialogues randomly. This is what makes separates a good actor from the rest. You never know which part of his past he is tapping to get into character. You can’t take this so easily.”The actor emphasised that in order to enter the characters' heads, actors enter difficult places. He angrily asked in what way people are able to dismiss all of this as pretentious and if they have ever attempted to portray a role similar to this. He even called out Jim Sarbh and Prashant Narayanan for their remarks and said, “What are they doing now? Do you see what Bobby Deol has been doing lately? And what is the man who commented doing currently?”He concluded by saying, “Who are we to say if Ranveer should or should not put himself through a painful process? What if he did? How do we know it? It is very easy to make such comments. We cannot underestimate anyone.. This is an actor’s job.”In a recent interview with The Quint, Jim Sarbh stated, “There are all those actors who are like ‘You know, I was so stuck in my character that I had to get mental therapy for weeks after.’ I was like ‘shut up bro. You didn’t even know your lines on the day, what nonsense.”On the work front, Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s new film ‘Rautu Ka Raaz’ was released on ZEE5 on June 28.","Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer Singh.

Calories Burned by Walking: How many calories are burned in walking 1 km?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/how-many-calories-are-burned-in-walking-1-km/articleshow/111300054.cms,"Factors influencing calorie burn



Heart diseases in women: Experts weighs in on latest worrying trends, signs and symptoms

Estimating calorie burn



How to enhance calorie burn



One effective way to burn more calories is by walking faster. A brisk pace increases your heart rate, leading to higher calorie expenditure.

Incorporate intervals of fast walking or jogging. Alternating between walking and jogging or sprinting can significantly increase the total calories burned.

Carrying light weights or wearing a weighted vest can add resistance, increasing the energy required and thus, burning more calories.

Opt for routes with hills or uneven terrain. Walking uphill or on trails provides a more strenuous workout than flat surfaces.

Simply walking longer distances will naturally increase the total calories burned. Gradually increasing your walking distance is a great way to boost your overall calorie expenditure.

Health benefits of walking beyond calorie burn



Walking is one of the simplest and most effective forms of exercise, offering numerous health benefits. From improving cardiovascular health to keeping the respiratory system on track, walking offers several benefits that can be reaped during a regular day.One frequently asked question is, ""How many calories are burned after walking 1 kilometer?"" The answer depends on several factors, including weight, walking speed , and terrain.The number of calories burned during walking significantly depends on the individual’s weight. Heavier individuals burn more calories because their bodies require more energy to move. For example, a person weighing 70 kg will burn fewer calories walking 1 km compared to someone weighing 90 kg.The pace at which you walk affects the calorie expenditure . Walking at a brisk pace (5-6 km/h) burns more calories compared to a leisurely stroll (3-4 km/h). Increasing your walking speed boosts your heart rate and energy expenditure, leading to higher calorie burn.Walking on different types of terrain or inclines also impacts the number of calories burned. Walking uphill or on uneven terrain requires more effort than walking on flat, smooth surfaces. Thus, walking on hilly or rugged paths increases calorie consumption.Metabolism tends to slow with age, so younger people might burn calories more efficiently than older individuals. Additionally, men generally have a higher muscle mass compared to women, resulting in slightly higher calorie burn.Individuals with higher fitness levels tend to burn fewer calories performing the same activity as their bodies become more efficient at utilizing energy. Conversely, those who are less fit may burn more calories as their bodies work harder.To provide a general estimate, let’s consider a few scenarios based on body weight:A person weighing 55 kg walking at a moderate pace (5 km/h) burns approximately 50-60 calories per kilometer. The exact number can vary based on speed and terrain, but this provides a baseline figure.For someone weighing 70 kg, the calorie burn is roughly 60-75 calories per kilometer. This estimate assumes a moderate walking pace on flat terrain. The calorie burn increases with faster walking speeds or uphill walks.A person weighing 90 kg may burn about 80-100 calories walking 1 kilometer. This higher calorie expenditure is due to the increased energy required to move a heavier body.Walking 1 kilometer may burn a modest number of calories, but the health benefits extend far beyond weight management. Regular walking can improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, enhance mood, and boost overall well-being. It’s a low-impact exercise suitable for all ages and fitness levels, making it an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.Common walking mistakes to avoid include overstriding, where steps are too long, leading to inefficient movement and potential injury. Walking with poor posture, such as slouching or leaning too far forward or backward, can strain muscles and joints. Another mistake is walking with tense shoulders or clenched fists, which increases tension and discomfort. Neglecting proper footwear and walking on hard surfaces without cushioning can impact joints over time. Finally, not warming up or cooling down properly before and after walking can increase the risk of injury. Correcting these mistakes promotes safer, more enjoyable walking experiences while minimizing strain on the body.Certain individuals should avoid walking if they have medical conditions or physical limitations that could be exacerbated by physical activity. This includes people with severe arthritis, recent bone fractures, acute injuries, or conditions affecting balance and coordination. Individuals with cardiovascular issues like unstable angina or severe heart failure should consult their healthcare provider before engaging in strenuous activities such as prolonged walking. Pregnant women with complications like preterm labor or placental disorders should also be cautious. Always seek medical advice if unsure about your ability to walk safely based on your health status.Walking offers widespread benefits, especially for those leading sedentary lives like office workers, aiding in countering prolonged sitting and improving overall health. Older adults benefit from maintaining mobility and joint flexibility through regular walks, lowering the risk of age-related mobility problems. For individuals managing stress or mental health issues, walking is therapeutic, enhancing mood and reducing anxiety. Moreover, anyone aiming to enhance cardiovascular fitness, manage weight, or boost overall well-being can significantly benefit from integrating regular walks into their daily routine. Whether to combat inactivity, support aging joints, alleviate stress, or improve physical fitness, walking serves as a simple yet effective way to promote health across various age groups and lifestyles.","The number of calories burned during walking significantly depends on the individual’s weight.
