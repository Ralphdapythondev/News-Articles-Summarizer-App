What is your biggest challenge as a lone candidate of

TMC

in UP?

What made you pick Bhadohi over Mirzapur where you have a stronger base?

How well has the alliance worked for you?

TMC and Congress aren’t on great terms in West Bengal. Did you draw flak on this account?

Is Mamata Banerjee keeping an eye on your election, or are you by yourself?

Any direct interaction with Mamata Banerjee on election?

What are your poll promises?

How well are you placed in the constituency?

Trinamool Congress ’s lone candidate in UP ,, who is contesting from Bhadohi as INDIA bloc pick, is confident of his victory. Talking to, he spoke about the challenges and poll prospects. Excerpts:When we started out two-and-a-half months ago, the common suggestion was that I should contest on Samajwadi Party’s symbol, but I kept reinforcing and the challenge of people not knowing my party’s symbol was eventually won over.We were careful about the selection of words that connected with the people to describe the symbol as ‘phool’ (flower) is normally used by the BJP in the Hindi belt. We used ‘Do daali aur chhe patti wala phool’ to help voters recall the symbol.Mirzapur was my first choice and I have a personal connection with that seat. But I accepted the decision of the leadership. Bhadohi is also not new to me because of my familial association. Bhadohi was one of the safest seats that SP could offer to TMC. Soon, I realised that most constituencies are the same and the strategy to reach out to voters should be tweaked according to hyperlocal needs. We did extensive visits to establish connections with voters.I am an INDIA bloc candidate and have all the support from members of constituent parties. Though it took some time for the alliance dharma to trickle down but when it did, it worked like well-oiled machinery. AAP, which has a small presence in this region, started working on its own. Akhilesh Yadav’s rally pulled people from neighbouring constituencies as well.Initially, there was some hesitation, but when instructions came from the high command, problems were ironed out.We send regular updates and get questions/suggestions and feedback from her end. She also sent TMC MP Nadim-ul-Haque as her emissary, and recently, Rajya Sabha member Sushmita Dev also camped here. She also sent a couple of MLAs to oversee activities.Yes. We planned a mega rally but then we realised that the sixth phase was crucial for the party in West Bengal, and she was more needed there.I have kept Nyay Patra and Samajwadi Party manifesto as the base and picked up points from them besides listing out local issues like a university in the district, need for a better system to facilitate carpet export and promote skill development opportunities.If we keep Akhilesh Yadav’s rally as a reference point, as compared to 2019 or 2022 elections, people are listening more carefully to what the INDIA bloc leaders are saying. During campaigning, I realised that the alliance manifesto has percolated with more clarity than Modi’s guarantee. In fact, people of this constituency are fighting elections as they feel that the double engine has failed them on various fronts. The BJP is not sure of its candidate for the seat. Three different candidates have contested on the BJP ticket since 2014. People want to give a chance to someone other than the BJP candidate.","Trinamool Congress’s lone candidate in UP, who is contesting from Bhadohi as INDIA bloc pick, is confident of his victory.

How do you see the political issues churning up nationally this election?

The BJP leadership is spinning the political narrative around Hindutva. Don’t you think the election is going on a communal track?

Are you dissociating yourself with the BJP’s campaign line?

Then how do you tend to go about it?

Do you prefer keeping a very low profile while connecting with people?

What’s your opinion about BJP taking on Congress in Rae Bareli and Amethi calling for making them “Parivar mukt”.

You have been associated with the BJP for over two decades. How much has the party changed over the time?

Didn’t it hurt when your son Varun who himself has been an MP, was benched by the BJP?

Varun has been missing from action ever since he was denied a ticket. Will he campaign?

What future do you see for Varun?

You said that Sultanpur is your only focus. What kinds of problems do people come up with and do you go about it?

The BJP leaders keep raising the Ram Temple issue. PM Narendra Modi has been cornering opposition for not attending Ram Temple consecration ceremony. How do you see the overall issue?

Do you plan to visit Ram Temple?

How do you see the challenge from the opposition? You won the last election by a narrow margin (

In an interview with, she spells out her strategy.Excerpts…I have no idea about issues outside Sultanpur. And for me issues in Sultanpur are purely local.Not here in Sultanpur.I don’t dissociate or associate myself. I just want to stay with people in Sultanpur. My objective here is to see what people want here.See, there is no need to create big problems when there are none. We have tendencies to create big issues for nothing. We have no big issues here. People just want to remain connected with their elected representatives (MPs and MLAs).That’s the only way I work.Seriously, I just don’t want to get into this. I just don’t want to comment on them at all. I never comment on other seats and other parties and their leaders. Rae Bareli and Amethi are not an issue here in Sultanpur.You know, all political parties adapt themselves to leaders. So as the leader comes there is an adaptive change in a party and its organisation.Let’s just finish it off. I just can’t keep feeling the pain.I do expect him to campaign here soon.I see a very bright future for him. And I am sure he will work very hard for it. A party does not depend only on MPs. In fact, most of the leaders in BJP are not MPs.They often come up with bizarre problems. There is a man who wants the body of his wife exhumed. I don’t tell a lie. Everybody’s work is done. And if it is not done then it is explained as to why it could not be done.It is not an issue here. Ram Mandir is in everybody’s heart.

"In Ghatal, two actors and a worn-out flood-relief script",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-ghatal-two-actors-and-a-worn-out-flood-relief-script/articleshow/110347149.cms,"GHATAL: Ghatal’s annual tryst with floods is a hot-button issue that crops up every elections and is put on the back burner after voting. The Ghatal Master Plan was proposed way back in 1959 to bring relief to people living in the lowlying areas in and around the Ghatal sub-division of West Bengal. It took Planning Commission 20 years to okay the plan and its foundation was finally laid in 1982 — the year Trinamool Congress ’s Ghatal candidate Dev was born and his BJP opponent, former Tollywood co-star Hiraan , was all of six.Today, Dev is 41, Hiraan 47, and the proposed master plan, a sepiatinged 65. The lack of its implementation continues to dominate the poll discourse this year too.Considered among the country’s most flood-prone zones, the Ghatal sub-division is located 120km from Kolkata. It lies in the catchment area of the rain-fed Shilabati and Jhumi rivers at the base of the Chhota Nagpur plateau. Boats and canoes replace vehicles as flood waters inundate farmlands, roads and homes, destroying standing crops and displacing people.In 1982, Rs 50 crore was allocated to the plan after it was sanctioned. Today, it is a Rs 1,250-crore project that promises to benefit 17 lakh people across 12 blocks in West and East Midnapore districts by making the rivers navigable, clearing canals and ponds, setting up drainage facilities and pumping stations and building barrages, dams and bridges.According to the earlier plan, Centre was to bear 60% of its cost, and the state govt the rest.Unable to get the project on track, Dev had given up hope and even contemplated quitting politics. But in Feb 2023, CM Mamata Banerjee and party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee stepped in, announcing that if Centre does not fund the project, the state will fund it entirely. A survey will be conducted, and the first tranche of funds will be released before yearend, the CM promised.Hiraan, a PhD in rural development and a post-doctoral researcher at IIT Kharagpur, has not lost sight of the issue. While he has repeatedly stressed that Centre will fund this project, he questions the intent of Dev and the Mamata govt behind raking up the issue only during polls and not after.Dev has been Ghatal’s MP since 2014. It is also a fact that Bengal has been pressing the issue with Centre, but in vain. In his first speech as a Lok Sabha MP in Aug 2016, and his last in Feb 2024, he urged Centre to help mitigate Ghatal’s recurring flood crisis. Ghatal Master Plan figures in every election speech he has made since his nomination was announced by Trinamool on March 10.The battle for Ghatal has also led to an intense off-screen rivalry between Dev and Hiraan, who is also the sitting BJP MLA from Kharagpur.Hiraan’s relentless personal attacks on Dev, an actor with a huge fan following in Bengal, has been an electoral campaign fixture.If Keshpur, where Dev’s extended family lives, votes as it did in 2019, it will be an easy victory for him. Of his 1 lakh-plus victory margin on Ghatal LS seat, Keshpur assembly segment alone gave him a 92,000-vote lead. However, in the 2021 assembly elections, Trinamool’s Siuli Saha could win by a margin of only 20,000 votes.Keshpur grabbed headlines in 1998 following violent clashes between CPM and Trinamool Congress over control of the area, marking the first time Trinamool made inroads into the once-impregnable red bastion of CPM.However, since 2019, BJP has made significant inroads into Ghatal. In the 2021 assembly elections, BJP won the Ghatal seat. The saffron party secured a 41% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha contest in Ghatal against Trinamool’s 48%.","The Ghatal Master Plan was proposed way back in 1959 to bring relief to people living in the lowlying areas.

The campaigning for Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday saw one such interesting exchange between Prime Minister Modi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav .PM Modi took a dig at the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and ridiculed their coming together for a second time. ""I am surprised by the repeated release of 'Do Shehzade', a flop film of SP and Congress,"" PM Modi said at an election rally in Basti.The Prime Minister's reference was to the alliance of the two parties in 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Akhilesh and Rahul had then joined hands and ran a spirited campaign under the banner ""UP ke ladke."" However, the alliance failed and the BJP stormed to power in the state.The Samajwadi Party chief, who is known for his witty responses, reacted to PM's dig and said ""a new film will be released on June 4."" ""The INDIA alliance is surging ahead with the passing of every round of voting. A new film will be released on June 4 which the country will see with enthusiasm,"" Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally.The Samajwadi Party chief has exuded confidence about the results of ongoing Lok Sabha elections and has claimed that the INDIA bloc will be winning 79 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh.

Minor's bail sparks outrage

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Pune court has sent the minor's father to 2-day police custody till May 24 after his 17-year-old son rammed his Porsche into a motorcyle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies.This comes after Pune crime branch team on Tuesday morning detained the father of the teenage driver involved in Sunday’s fatal accident that killed two techies in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.The father, a prominent builder, is facing charges of giving his son his high-end car to drive despite knowing that the latter did not have a driving licence nor was he trained to drive the car and that his son consumed alcohol. The builder was detained from a lodge in Sambhajinagar, while his driver and associate were picked from a hotel.The builder attempted to outsmart the cops after fleeing the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but it had a GPS fitted in it.The accident occurred around 2.30am on Sunday when the Porsche Taycan, driven by the 17-year-old at 160kmph speed at the time of the crash, rammed into a motorcycle from behind in Kalyaninagar. The collision claimed the lives of Anish Awadhia and Ashwini Kosta, both 24-year-old techies hailing from Madhya Pradesh.Before the accident, the teen along with his friends drank alcohol at two pubs in the city - Cosie and Blak Mariott. He spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at Cosie which the teen and his friends visited at 10.40pm on Saturday evening. They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott, at 12.10am after Cosie stopped serving them.The police also arrested Naman Bhutada (25), the owner of the Cosie pub in Mundhwa, and Sachin Kaatkar (35), a staff member at the establishment. Additionally, Sandip Sangle (35), an assistant restaurant manager at the Blak Marriott pub, also located in Mundhwa, has been taken into custody. The minor driver had reportedly visited these establishments to party with his friends before the fateful accident.The teenage driver was arrested by the police, but within 15 hours, he was granted bail by Pune's Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which also rejected the police's request for his trial as an adult. The bail conditions set by the JJB, which included writing a 300-word essay on accidents, painting traffic awareness boards, working with a traffic constable, and attending counseling, sparked outrage among the public. Even Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed shock at the bail conditions, calling them ""shocking and surprising"" and suggesting that the order needs to be reviewed.","Pune court has sent the minor's father to 2-day police custody till May 24 after his 17-year-old son rammed his Porsche into a motorcyle from behind, resulting in the death of 2 young techies.

There was a time when the IITs would see recruiters land up at their gates a day before the hiring season began, and the famed 'day zero' came into being.Far from that glorified time, the class of 2024 has had a rough start to their professional careers. Around 38% IITians across all 23 campuses are yet to be placed, shows responses to RTI applications filed by IIT Kanpur alumnus Dheeraj Singh.IIT Delhi has mailed its alumni seeking help to place the current batch or recommend graduates to firms looking to hire engineers. IIT-Bombay and Birla Institute of Technology and Science have also reached out to its alumni.As the placement session for the academic year 2023-24 at IIT-Delhi draws to a close, we find ourselves faced with a significant challenge. Despite our best efforts, approximately 400 students are yet to secure job placements. In light of this, we are reaching out to our esteemed alumni network , seeking your assistance in providing job opportunities for these graduating students, according to RTI responses .From offering students jobs in their organisations to providing referrals and recommendations to even extending internship opportunities, the appeal goes on to ask old students to support their juniors. ""On behalf of the Office ofCareer Services (OCS) at IIT-Delhi, we appeal to you to consider extending a helping hand to our students. Your support and efforts in this matter will not only be greatly appreciated but will also serve as a crucial steppingstone for these students as they embark on their professional journeys,"" it states.Birla Institute of Technology and Science first reached out to its alumni two months ago, and so did many other institutes, some informally, some other loudly.IIT-Bombay also reached out to former students for assistance. While placements are still on and will go on till June end, about 10% of the batch - or 250 candidates - who are participating in placements are yet to find a job. According to an RTI by Singh, last year, 329 candidates were not placed and 171 of them from the class of 2022 failed to find a job.V Ramgopal Rao, BITS group vice-chancellor, said, ""Everywhere, placements are 20% to 30% lower. If some institute is saying all students have been placed, the quality of jobs leaves much to be desired. This is the first year when ChatGPT and large language models have started showing their impact. If two people can do the work of three people, we are already 30% down in hiring. There has already been a lot of overhiring and many countries are holding elections this year, so companies are adopting a wait-and-watch policy.""""Over 7,000 IIT students are yet to be placed via campus placement this year across all the 23 IITs.

Soren drops bail plea after Supreme Court frowns on it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/soren-drops-bail-plea-after-supreme-court-frowns-on-it/articleshow/110344107.cms,"SC refuses to entertain Soren's

bail plea

on ground of suppression of facts

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to entertain Jharkhand's former CM Hemant Soren 's petition challenging the validity of his arrest by ED in a money laundering case related to alleged illegal acquisition of 8.8 acres in Ranchi, thus scotching his hopes for interim bail to campaign in the polls.A vacation bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and S C Sharma critiqued Soren for suppressing from SC that the trial court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet against him and, also, that his bail petition had been dismissed.Soren 's lawyer Kapil Sibal was allowed to withdraw the plea on request.We expected some candour from the petitioner to inform SC that he had applied for bail and that it was dismissed. It was also not brought to our notice that the trial court has taken cognisance of the chargesheet. Petitioners must not come to SC suppressing facts,"" the bench said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal took responsibility for the twin facts not being mentioned before the bench. ""Soren was in jail. The fault is mine and not that of Soren. I have never ever even attempted to suppress facts from the court,"" he said. The bench suggested that a senior advocate should not take the blame on behalf of the petitioner. As the bench kept reiterating its serious reservations on suppression of vital facts by Soren and said it would dismiss the petition on that ground alone, Sibal requested that the petitioner be allowed to withdraw the plea challenging his arrest. The court accepted the request and dismissed the petition as withdrawn.Prior to withdrawal of the petition, Sibal said Soren was seeking interim bail while challenging his ""illegal"" arrest on Jan 31.But the bench said once the trial court took cognisance of the chargesheet, the case took a different hue as the trial court had rendered a prima facie opinion that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the charges against the accused. This vital fact was not shared with SC when the petition challenging arrest was filed, it said.Sibal attempted to put the blame on Jharkhand HC. ""The petition challenging the arrest was filed on Feb 2 and order was reserved on Feb 28. For two months, HC judge kept the verdict reserved knowing that chargesheet would be filed within 60 days rendering the challenge infructuous. Can a judge's actions prejudice a person's fundamental right to liberty? I have been saying that Soren has been wrongly dealt with by HC.""Unconvinced, the bench proceeded to dismiss the petition. Sibal interjected and requested for withdrawal of the petition. The bench agreed. But it declined to entertain Sibal's request for a direction to HC to decide Soren's bail plea in a month and said, ""It is difficult for the SC to manage the business of high courts.""",Jharkhand's former CM Hemant Soren's petition challenging the validity of his arrest by ED in a money laundering case related to alleged illegal acquisition of 8.8 acres in Ranchi.

The voting percentage has not been as expected. Can BJP win more than 400 seats even if voting is less? Who are these voters who are not leaving their homes?

PM

Voting percentage increased in Kashmir. What is the message of increased voting in Kashmir?

What difference do you feel in the elections and campaign of 2024 as compared to 2014 and 2019?

What do you consider to be the biggest achievement of the last 10 years and how are you preparing yourself for the third term?

When our reporters travelled across the country, one thing that emerged was that people everywhere talked about employment and inflation. What will you do for the youth in the first 100 days after winning? Would you like to give any assurance to the youth on the employment front?

Foreign policy has been very important during both your tenures. At present, the world is going through a lot of ups and downs. The G7 summit is scheduled immediately after the election results. How do you see India’s role in the new situation?

BJP’s entire campaign is focused on you. Has this reduced the importance of MPs and reduced the incentive for them to cultivate their constituents because they can now hope to win only through Modi magic?

You got the women’s reservation bill passed. Will we see this implemented by the new govt?

The political situation in Maharashtra has become very complicated. Will NDA be able to repeat the record of the last two times?

BJP has made a lot of efforts in West Bengal. Last time, BJP was successful in winning 18 seats. How difficult is this state for you compared with others and what is your expectation this time?

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had to go to jail in the liquor scam case. He says ED has framed him and that no money has been recovered from him till now.

This time, Congress and AAP are contesting elections together in Delhi. Can this cause any problem for BJP in winning the seven seats thrice in a row? This time, you have changed six candidates.

Prime Minister, you are the MP from Kashi. You have promoted Kashi a lot in the last 10 years. Today, Kashi is becoming the most preferred tourism destination in the country. The infrastructure work done by you has also brought a lot of change in Banaras. How do you see the impact of this on the economy and employment situation of Banaras and Purvanchal?

The opposition says democracy is in danger and if BJP wins, we will remain a democracy only in form.

You look very fit. What’s the secret of your health, your routine from morning till night?

'Vote To Save Democracy': Cong Leader Digvijaya Singh Warns Of 'Change In Constitution'

PM Modi brushed aside the allegation that he was seeking a 'super majority' to change the Constitution as ""fresh falsehood"" being spread by opposition after ""failure"" of its campaign on the purchase of Rafale fighters five years ago.""Earlier, their trick used to work sometimes, but today, in the age of social media , their lies get exposed within minutes.They lied on Rafale, they lied on HAL, they were caught. India knows who wants to change the Constitution. Who had conspired to end democracy through Emergency?"" Modi said in an interview with Hindi daily Navbharat Times.Modi also rejected allegations levelled by Arvind Kejriwal and others that the Centre has been misusing central agencies, including ED, against opposition. Not a single such case has been proved to be based on false charges, he said, adding the Delhi CM has lost his credibility. ""After coming out on bail for a few days, he (Kejriwal) has been further exposed. He and his people (AAP netas) are making mistakes, and blaming BJP. But public knows the truth,"" he said.Describing the rise in voting percentage in Kashmir as the most gratifying part of the polls, he said, ""I am satisfied that steps we have taken for the better future of J&K are yielding positive results."": It is very important for any democracy that people participate actively in voting. This is a bigger issue than the victory or defeat of any party. In my rallies through the country, I am appealing to people to vote. I tell them to consider voting as an obligation and fulfil it. As for BJP’s prospects... after four phases of elections, we have achieved the majority mark. Now the fight is only for crossing the 400-mark. Experts can go on analysing, but if they take care to see BJP’s chemistry with voters, they will realise that the slogan of crossing 400 is going to become a reality.■ For me, the most gratifying part of the current polls is the rise in voting percentage in Kashmir. Pictures of people queuing up outside polling stations there are so energising. I am satisfied that the steps we have taken for the better future of Jammu & Kashmir are yielding positive results. After Srinagar, we have seen bumper voting in Baramulla also. Every Kashmiri is feeling relieved after seeing changes post-370 (abrogation). The people there have understood that they were being cheated all these years under the guise of Article 370. For decades, the people of Jammu & Kashmir were kept away from development. The people there were troubled by corruption but lacked options because of the control of dynastic parties. Today, people there are voting for development without any fear or pressure.■ When I went among the people in 2014, I got the opportunity to know their expectations. They wanted change, development. In 2019, I saw the glow of confidence in people’s eyes. That confidence came from the work of our govt in those five years. I realised that people’s aspirations have expanded in the period. They now have bigger dreams about their families, and also about the country. The last five years have been one of rapid growth and big decisions. It has affected the life of every person. Now, when I am campaigning in the 2024 elections, I see a determination in the eyes of people. This is the resolution of developed India. This is the resolution of corruption-free India. This is the resolve of a strong India; 140 crore Indians are confident that their dreams can be fulfilled only under the BJP govt, hence there is unprecedented enthusiasm among the public about the third innings of our govt.■ In the last 10 years, our govt has taken many major decisions related to economy, social justice, welfare of the poor and national interest. Our actions have impacted people of every class and every community. If you analyse different areas, you will come to know about our achievements and how people have been affected by them. I am very satisfied that we were able to bring 25 crore people out of poverty. We were able to provide houses, toilets, electricity, water, gas connections and free treatment facilities to crores of people. They had not even imagined these changes in their lives. We have given them the right to live with dignity and the courage to stand on their own feet, also the belief that their children will not have to go through what they suffered. We also made efforts to empower female members of the household. Women have become financially strong through schemes like Lakhpati Didi, Drone Didi.■ In the last 10 years, we have been successful in keeping inflation under control. During UPA’s time, inflation rate used to be in double digits. Today, there is a situation of war in different corners of the world. These circumstances have affected the country’s economy and inflation. We gave priority to the interests of the people and did not allow the price of petrol and diesel to go up. If the price of petrol and diesel had increased, everything would have become expensive.Today, poor families get free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh in the best hospitals. Due to Jan Aushadhi Kendras, there has been 70-80% relief in the cost of medicines. Be it knee surgery or heart operation, the cost of everything has reduced by more than half. Today, loan rates are the lowest in the country. If you want to buy a car or a house, then easy and cheap loan is available. Personal loan was never this easy in the country. Farmers are getting bags of urea and fertiliser at 10 times lower prices than the world’s price. Many new employment opportunities have been created in the last 10 years. Lakhs of youths have got govt jobs. New employment opportunities have been created in the private sector. According to EPFO, 6 crore new members have joined it in the last seven years. Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows that unemployment rate, which was 6% in 2017, has come down to 3%. The youth now have opportunities to progress in the space sector, drone sector, gaming sector also. The digital revolution in the country has also created opportunities for the youth. Today, data is so cheap in India and that is why the creator economy of the country is growing. Today, there are more than 1.25 lakh startups in the country, which are creating a large number of employment opportunities. We have prepared an action plan for the first 100 days of our govt, in which we have added 25 more days separately for the youth. We are considering the suggestions of youth coming from all over the country, and after the results, work on it will start rapidly.■ Perhaps this is the first election in which India’s foreign policy is being discussed so much. That is because India’s reputation has grown in the last 10 years. Every Indian feels proud when the country’s reputation rises. India became a strong voice of the Global South in the G20 summit, now India’s role in the G7 is going to be very important. Today, every country in the world knows that India has a strong govt.We have kept our national interest paramount in our foreign policy. Today, when we are at the trade agreement table, the other side instantly realises that it is having to deal with a new India. Initially, they were surprised but have now accepted the reality of new India, an India full of confidence. India has strongly told countries engaged in military confrontation that this is not the time for war. Today, the world believes that India’s progress is good for the entire world and humanity.■ This is the opposition’s propaganda. BJP works like a team. Every member of this team is working hard to win the elections. Every party worker is as important as the PM in the campaign. True, as PM, I definitely go to connect with the public, but people connect with us only through the MP candidate. I am going to the people with the national vision and am giving the guarantee of fulfilling it, while our MP candidate is giving the assurance of fulfilling local aspirations.■ This question has emerged from the disappointing experience of Congress rule, when laws were made but it took years to get notified. Nari Shakti Vandan Act has an important role in the roadmap we have prepared for the next five years. We are committed to giving rights to half the country’s population. A new era of women’s empowerment will begin with increasing participation of women in Parliament and legislative assemblies of the country.■ The situation in Maharashtra has, in fact, become simple. People have to choose between dynastic parties and a grand alliance dedicated to the development of the country. Shiv Sena, which is the real inheritor of Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideology, is with us. People are seeing that the fake Shiv Sena has abandoned its core ideas and joined hands with Congress. Similarly, NCP has associated itself with us for the development of Maharashtra and the country. Now, the NCP of Maha ‘Vinash’ Aghadi is only asking for votes to take his (Sharad Pawar) family forward. People are also seeing that the INDI coalition has already accepted defeat. Now, he (Pawar) is talking about merging with Congress to save his existence after the elections. Voting for such people is wasting your vote. This time, we are going to break our previous record in Maharashtra.■ Be it TMC, Congress or Left, all of them have committed the same sins in Bengal. People in Bengal have understood that these parties have only slogans and no vision for development. Once, people from other states used to come to Bengal for employment, today people from all over Bengal are forced to migrate. The public is also seeing that parties that are contesting against each other in Bengal are seen together in Delhi. There can be no bigger deception than this. This is the reason why INDI Alliance is not able to win the trust of the people. The people of Bengal have been tolerating corruption, violence, anarchy, mafia and appeasement for a long time. TMC’s identity has become that of a scam govt, which has crushed the dreams of the youth to fill its coffers. The situation there is that even after getting a govt job, the youth are not sure whether their job will remain or will be lost. People are completely disappointed with the current govt in Bengal. Now, the development model of BJP is in front of them. Wherever I went in Bengal, I saw unprecedented confidence in BJP among the people. Especially in Bengal, I saw that I was getting a lot of love from women. Whenever I meet women, they become emotional, I too am not able to control my emotions. We will win more seats than before in Bengal this time.■ Have you ever come across an accused who has acknowledged perpetrating a scam? Or one who says that police rightly arrested him? If the agencies framed him, why did he (Kejriwal) not get relief from the court? The opposition, which has accused ED and the agencies, has till date not been able to prove that even a single allegation against them was false. He came out on bail for a few days but has got further exposed. He and his people are making mistakes and are blaming BJP. But people know their reality. His words no longer have any credibility.■ INDI Alliance parties are fighting a losing battle in Delhi. They are facing an existential crisis. After the polls, there will be no such thing as INDI Alliance left. The people of Delhi had ousted Congress long ago, now they want to survive by joining hands with other parties. Did anyone ever think that the day would come for Congress, which ruled the country for so long, that members of its ‘first family’ would vote for some other candi date and not for their own party? The parties of INDI Alliance in Delhi are distinguished by two features: they are corrupt and lie shamelessly. They try to manipulate public sentiment and make false promises. People are very intelligent today, they will decide. BJP has fielded its candidates keeping in mind the interest of people. In BJP, no Lok Sabha seat is considered a leader’s property. The party takes decisions according to what is appropriate in the public interest. For us, politics is a medium of service. This is the reason why our workers do not get disappointed that their ticket has been cut, rather they engage in serving the public with full dedication.■ Kashi is a wonderful city. On one hand, it is the oldest city in the world. It has been revered in the Puranas. On the other hand, it is also the economic nucleus of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the last 10 years, we have developed religious tourism in Kashi a lot. We focused on city streets, cleanliness, facilities in markets, train and bus arrangements. We created many facilities for passengers from the station to different places in the city. After all this, when we set out to promote Banaras, there was a strong desire among devotees across the country to see the new Kashi. Now, many times more tourists come here than earlier. This created new employment opportunities in the entire city. We have started bringing industries to Banaras. A new campus of TCS has been built, Banas Dairy has been built, Trade Facilitation Centre has been built, new machines are being given to weavers of Kashi, youth have got Mudra loans. This gave a new impetus to the economy not only of Banaras but also of many surrounding districts.■ Congress and its ecosystem have come out to contest elections on the basis of lies and rumours. Their trick would work earlier but today, in the age of social media, its lies get exposed within minutes. They lied on Rafale, they were caught. They lied on Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, they got caught. The public no longer takes them seriously. The country knows who wants to change the Constitution. Who had conspired to end the country’s democracy through Emergency? The Constitution was changed the maximum number of times during the tenure of Congress. They changed the original copy of the Constitution for appeasement. Congress curbed the freedom of expression through the first amendment. In 60 years, Congress repeatedly attacked the basic spirit of the Constitution and dismissed many state govts one after the other. Congress holds the record for imposing President’s rule the maximum number of times. They want to destroy the Constitution because it is an obstacle to their real intentions. You see, the framers of the Constitution had opposed reservation on the basis of religion. But Congress has repeatedly tried to bring it to please its vote bank. After several failed efforts, they implemented it at the cost of OBCs. The leaders of Congress and INDI Alliance shed tears for democracy, but reality is that they use all their strength to crush democracy and suppress the voice of the people.■ I believe that I have been greatly blessed by some divine power, which has made me a medium for public welfare. Over the years, my belief has strengthened that God has chosen me to fulfil a special responsibility. He is also giving me the strength to complete it. The feeling of serving people gives me energy.","PM Modi says he is satisfied that steps have been taken for the better future of J&K. He rejects allegations levelled by Arvind Kejriwal and others that the Centre has been misusing central agencies, including ED, against opposition.

Officials who refused to speak on record by saying that the matter was pending in Supreme Court, said it was wrong to take the numbers on polling day , as distinct from those made available the following day, as the basis, for the simple reason that details of voting from remote polling stations were rarely in on that day.Going by the updated turnout figures, both in absolute and percentage terms, figures were not very different from the ""final"" ones released by the commission, they said. For example, in the first phase, the overall voting percentage increased from 63.5% on polling day (April 19) to 66.1% the next day. The final voting was the same as the percentage.The trend was the same in the first three phases while in the fourth, the final voting rose marginally to 69.2% compared to the figure of 68.9%. In this phase, maximum increase was recorded in the updated data. Sources said this was because of high turnout later in the day as polling had to be extended in several polling stations.Officials cited data from 2019 to counter claims of a high level of revision. In all the phases in 2019, the gap between the number released at the evening press conference on polling day and the final numbers released by EC ranged between 1.5% and 3.4%.""All these years, turnout data has been updated on the second day after all polling parties provide the exact number of people who voted in each polling booth.

The poll panel also said giving out final voter turnout numbers based on Form 17C would lead to ""confusion among voters as it will also include postal ballot counts"", while pointing out that turnout data of each polling booth is shared with polling agents of candidates on the day of voting itself.The EC filed the affidavit in response to the application by NGO ' Association for Democratic Reforms ' (ADR), which has sought that final voter turnout figures of all polling stations be made public in 48 hours.""ADR's application ignores the disclaimer to the effect that the figures in the non-statutory voter turnout app is secondary data and is only provisional in nature,"" EC said.Election Commission accused the NGO 'Association for Democratic Reforms' (ADR) of ""trying to create entitlement when none exists in the law by way of filing an application in the middle of an election period"". ""In any electoral contest, the margin of victory may be very close. In such cases, disclosure of Form 17C in public domain may cause confusion in the minds of voters with regard to the total votes polled as the latter figure would include the number of votes polled as per Form 17C as well as the votes received through postal ballots . However, such difference may not be easily understood by voters and may be used by persons with motivated interests to cast aspersion on the whole electoral process... cause chaos in the election machinery which is already in motion,"" the affidavit said.""The voter turnout data is facilitative and a transparency initiative of the commission, in addition to extant statutory design of providing exact turnout data of each polling booth to polling agents of candidates,"" EC added.The poll panel also rebutted allegations of increase in voting percentage days after polling possibly being a sign of change of EVMs and said ""vested interests habitually throw baseless charges"" during elections to create suspicion and discredit the exercise to demotivate voters. ""There are certain elements and vested interests who keep on throwing baseless and false allegations, creating unwarranted atmosphere of suspicion in close proximity of time of conduct of every elections by the EC to somehow discredit the same,"" EC said.It stressed that other countries were looking forward to the efficacy of conduct of elections in the largest democracy where 97 crore voters will exercise their franchise in seven phases, and said, ""There is a consistent mala fide campaign/design/effort to keep on raising suspicion and doubt in every possible manner and by misleading assertions and baseless allegations regarding the conduct of elections.""It said the latest charges from ADR came after a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta on April 26 dismissed its petition seeking return to ballot paper and rejected the NGO's allegations about the efficacy of EVMs. ADR filed the application in its petition, which has been pending since 2019, soon after leaders of Congress, TMC and CPM wrote to EC expressing concern over high increase in voter turnout figures days after phase one and two of the polls. SC will hear the case on May 24.EC relied on SC's six landmark decisions since 1952 reiterating that no petition or application would be entertained by courts during the process of elections and that any grievance about elections has to be made through an election petition after the completion of the process and declaration of results. Hence, the present application by ADR was not maintainable, it said.EC said since five out of seven phases of polling had already taken place, the procedure for declaration of voting percentage could not be changed for the last two phases scheduled for May 25 and June 1. On ADR's plea for uploading constituency - and polling station-wise voter turnout percentage on the EC website, the commission said the issue relating to voting percentage declaration was fully adjudicated by the bench of Justices Khanna and Datta.","EC says there is no legal mandate to provide final voter turnout data of all polling stations to any person other than the candidate or his/her agents.

""Ye party khud apna samvidhan nahi manti hai (This party disobeys its own constitution).

""I was told SP and Congress hand out contracts to bring people to their rallies. These people are reaching the stage because they have not received their payments.""The PM said Congress would shield the corrupt by changing all laws if it had the reins.
