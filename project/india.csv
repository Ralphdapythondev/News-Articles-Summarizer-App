"In Sambhal, with a large Muslim presence, Kalki skews arithmetic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-sambhal-with-a-large-muslim-presence-kalki-skews-arithmetic/articleshow/109742999.cms,"Sambhal , a tranquil town in Moradabad about 180km from Delhi, shot into the limelight on Feb 19 when PM Modi laid the foundation stone of a Kalki temple here.Kalki is believed to be a yet-to-beborn avatar of Vishnu who will complete the deity’s dashavatar (10 incarnations), and Sambhal is believed to be where Kalki will appear. Thus, a temple dedicated to the deity, constructed by expelled Congress functionary Acharya Pramod Krishnam, who has now aligned with BJP , is generating significant interest in religious and political circles.Sambhal has traditionally been a Samajwadi Party (SP) bastion — its veteran, Shafiq Ur-Rehman Barq (who died at 93 a few months ago), had won the seat more than once. SP has now fielded his grandson, Zia Ur-Rehman Barq, the incumbent Kundarki MLA, from this constituency.With a large Muslim population — comprising almost 35% of the electorate — the seat had been a difficult place for BJP in 2019, as it lost all six seats in the Moradabad division, which encompasses Sambhal. But now, with the Kalki card up its sleeve, the party is hoping for a favourable turn of events.Krishnam, the peethadheeshwar (temple head) of Shri Kalki Dham, told TOI, “After Kashi, Ayodhya and Mathura, Kalki Peeth will be developed into a major religious centre, particularly after the PM himself laid its foundation. The move will impact the political landscape of western UP. Until now, the Hindu vote was divided into various splinter groups affiliated with regional parties. Now, it will bring all of them together.”Interestingly, Krishnam, who contested the 2014 polls from Sambhal on a Congress ticket and lost, is hoping to retain the liberal Muslims who attended various events at Kalki Dham in the past. “During the foundation ceremony, half of the attendees were not part of the BJP fold, and that included some Muslims too,” he said. “Barq had thrown a spanner into the temple proposal in 2016, but in Aug 2023, Allahabad high court gave a decision in our favour,” he claimed.Parmeshwar Lal Saini is BJP’s choice for the seat. He had lost to Barq Sr five years ago. Sambhal has always been an opposition stronghold, except for 2014, when BJP’s Satyapal Singh Saini emerged victorious, securing 34% of the votes to win a tight triangular contest against SP and BSP. In 2019, the SP-BSP alliance defeated Parmeshwar, with the latter still managing 41% of votes.Saini told TOI, “This time, we are confident that the lotus will bloom in Sambhal. The Kalki temple foundation by the PM will seal our victory. I have the support of voters, irrespective of gender, caste, or faith.”Saulat Ali, a former MLA who won from Moradabad in 1996, has since contested six elections without success. Recently, he parted ways with Congress to join BSP, and is contesting from Sambhal. Ali said, “I played a pivotal role in Zia Ur-Rehman Barq’s victory as Kundarki MLA as an SP candidate in 2022. As far as I see, SP has no significant presence in Samb hal, and the contest is two-pronged between BJP and BSP.”Ali holds considerable influence in the region considering his political experience. His father, Riyasat Hussain, was also a four-time MLA. His ability to sway supporters of Iqbal Mehmood, Barq’s rival, could impact the election outcome, especially considering Barq’s strained relations with Qureshi voters.Political experts agree on a possible Kalki effect. “BJP has skilfully used religion to blunt the impact of caste politics in the area. The Kalki event will consolidate Hindu votes for the party irrespective of the caste of the candidate they put up,” said Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, head of political science department at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut.Amroha-based analyst Shoib Chaudhary said, “Voters in Sambhal and surrounding districts have primarily been anti-BJP due to the large Muslim presence. These areas have remained SP strongholds for the last three decades, barring a few incidental wins for BJP on the back of an unconsolidated opposition. BJP had been eyeing these regions for long, and the development of a temple in Kalki Dham can work wonders for them.”","Kalki is believed to be a yet-to-beborn avatar of Vishnu who will complete the deity’s dashavatar (10 incarnations) A temple dedicated to the deity, constructed by expelled Congress functionary Acharya Pramod Krishnam, is generating significant interest in religious and political circles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109743009,imgsize-42794,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109743009.jpg"

"7 years gone, little action on govt’s 2017 plan on curbing ads for unhealthy foods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-gone-little-action-on-govts-2017-plan-on-curbing-ads-for-unhealthy-foods/articleshow/109742213.cms,"There has been little or no action on key recommendations in govt’s 2017 action plan for prevention and control of common non-communicable diseases which seek strict regulation of advertising, marketing and promotion of unhealthy food to children.

Seven years on, there is no regulation on what the plan described as “unchallenged aggressive marketing strategies” of food and beverage companies.

Promotion of

unhealthy foods

high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) came into focus recently when Supreme Court talked of expanding a petition on Patanjali’s

misleading ads

to include misleading ads “taking the public for a ride, in particular, adversely affecting health and well being of babies, young children, women..

. who have been consuming the products on the basis of misrepresentation”.

National Multisectoral Action Plan-NMAP (2017-22) drawn up in Oct 2017 included enactment of laws and other regulatory measures, launching of IEC (information, education, communication) campaigns, formulation of appropriate policies, and so on for “reduction of risk factors levels in children, adolescents and adults”. Unhealthy diet was one of the key risk factors identified and “change in lifestyle driven by unchallenged aggressive

marketing strategies

of unhealthy foods and beverages and alcohol industry” was identified as one of the challenges in bringing down NCDs.

The plan identified action points for 39 ministries/departments. Ministries of information and broadcasting (I&B), commerce, consumer affairs and food distribution, law and health were supposed to work together to regulate advertisement of demerit goods (like HFSS food products, alcohol, and tobacco) through “amendment of advertisement code of Cable Television Networks Rules and norms of journalist conduct; and Trademark Rules”.

Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under health ministry was supposed to implement interpretative

front of pack labelling

and detailed nutrition labelling at the back of the pack.

“On prevention of NCDs, the national plan contains two key policy provisions — front of pack labelling and prohibition of advertisements of HFSS foods. Both require a definition of HFSS foods. India had a pretty good definition of HFSS in the 2018 draft regulation on front of pack labelling, which matches the definition used in Latin American countries and many other regions.

But that draft was dropped. The same definition is there in the Sept 2022 draft too. But after putting the draft in the public domain for comments, it seems to have gone into cold storage as nothing has moved since then,” said Dr Arun Gupta, who has filed several complaints regarding misleading ads for HFSS foods.

Other recommendations include regulation to promote reformulation of processed foods to limit the amount of fats, sugar and salt in such products by the food processing ministry and FSSAI, and “guidelines to prohibit sponsorship of sports events/teams/athletes by companies producing products that have negative health externalities” by sports ministry.

“We filed RTIs with several ministries but barring a few, most have not done much about the action plan and some were not even aware of it. In one of its responses, the health ministry claimed that there were regular meetings on the plan but failed to provide any minutes of the meetings,” said Dr Nupur Bidla, member of Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, a national think tank on nutrition.",There has been little or no action on key recommendations in govt’s 2017 action plan for prevention and control of common non-communicable diseases.

Despite only three days remaining for the filing of nomination papers, the Congress has not yet announced a candidate for the seat, according to the party's district spokesperson, Anil Singh.Leaders and workers, including Congress district president Pradeep Singhal and former district president Yogendra Mishra, convened at the party office with posters stating ""(Amethi wants Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra).""""People of the constituency and Congress workers want a member of the Gandhi family as their candidate. We want Rahul Gandhi to contest from Amethi to bring back its lost honour,"" Singh said.The demonstrators demanded that the Congress immediately announce a candidate in Amethi, emphasising that the nominee should be from the Gandhi family. The seat was secured by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in 2014. However, in 2019, Gandhi contested the general elections from both Wayanad in Kerala and Amethi. He lost Amethi to BJP's Smriti Irani.(With inputs from agencies)","Raj Babbar, a seasoned Congress leader, has previously served as a Member of Parliament from Firozabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh.

US report names RAW man involved in alleged plot to take out Pannun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-report-names-raw-man-involved-in-alleged-plot-to-take-out-pannun/articleshow/109708372.cms,"US Pannun plot probe involves CIA, FBI, others

A report in Washington Post, a US newspaper, has claimed that a Research and Analysis Wing officer, Vikram Yadav , instructed a hired hit team to kill US-based Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun .According to the report, “US intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel .” It adds that Yadav was transferred back to CRPF after the Pannun plot unravelled last year.There was no response by the Indian govt to the assertions made in the report till late Monday night.US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official they referred to in the indictment as CC-1.Gupta is currently in a jail in Prague, where he was detained last year by Czech and US agencies. While India had formed a high-level committee in Nov to probe the information shared by the US about the role of the Indian official, saying it had a bearing on India’s security too, the govt has so far not revealed any of its findings.RAW officer Vikram Yadav, who was on deputation from CRPF, allegedly forwarded details of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, including his address in New York, said a Washington Post report, citing sources and a US indictment. The official is now back with the central paramilitary force.Given his background, Yadav “lacked training and skills” needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated US counter-intelligence capabilities, the Post said. According to the report, senior officials at the US justice department and FBI had pushed to prosecute Yadav, a step that would have implicated RAW in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. “But while a US indictment unsealed in November contained the bombshell allegation that the plot was directed by an Indian official, it referred to Yadav as only an unnamed co-conspirator, CC-1, and made no mention of the Indian spy agency,” it said.“Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to Modi’s inner circle,” the report said.","US authorities had last year indicted an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, for the plot, alleging that he was acting at the behest of an Indian official.

Calcutta high court sets aside Ganguly order in Suvendu kin case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-high-court-sets-aside-ganguly-order-in-suvendu-kin-case/articleshow/109704292.cms,"KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Monday set aside an order by former judge Abhijit Ganguly that fined Egra sub-divisional police officer Rs 5 lakh for allegedly “harassing” Krishnendu Adhikari , the elder brother of BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, Bengal’s leader of opposition.Ganguly joined BJP in March. He is the party candidate in Tamluk, one of the LS constituencies in East Midnapore, the Adhikaris’ home district.A division bench of Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya held that Ganguly’s order was passed without giving the state “appropriate opportunity” to present its case.The bench observed that such a situation was “uncalled for”.The bench directed the registry to list Krishnendu’s petition in an appropriate court to be heard “afresh” in June and stayed a notice sent to him by cops.Egra cops had sent the notice asking Krishnendu to attend a questioning session as a “witness” in a case over poor lighting on the Mecheda-Digha Bypass in East Midnapore. Krishnendu moved the former HC judge’s court in Nov 2023, praying for quashing the notice as the cops went beyond their remit and asked him to attend the session with 10 years’ income-tax returns.Ganguly admitted Krishnendu’s petition and passed an order the same day imposing Rs 5 lakh as cost on the Egra SDPO for “harassment”. “This is nothing but harassment. The police force was not created to harass a citizen,” the former judge had observed.On Monday, state advocate-general Kishore Datta moved an appeal. “No submission was made by the lawyer. Nothing was recorded in the order. The order was passed the day the petition reached the court,” Datta contended.Datta, pointing to the “chequered history” of the case, also referred to orders of a number of single-judge benches of HC. The CJ-led division bench did not go into the merits of the case but set aside the order saying the state was not heard. “Contesting respondents should have the opportunity to file affidavits. Let them file the affidavits,” CJ Sivagnanam observed.","Former judge Abhijit Ganguly fined Egra sub-divisional police officer Rs 5 lakh for allegedly “harassing’ Krishnendu Adhikari.

However, assuaging the state government's fear that the entire cabinet may be arrested over the case, the SC stayed a part of the HC's order that had asked the CBI to probe all officials involved in the recruitment of the teachers.The SC expressed serious concern about agency which conducted the recruitment test, destruction of OMR answer sheets, erasing of software about results and inclusion of people who were not part of the selection panel. ""You have to satisfy us how the high court went wrong,"" the CJI said.SC posted the next hearing for May 6.In an order passed last week, the Calcutta high court nullified the appointment of all the 25,753 teachers empanelled in 2016 for various categories of jobs at secondary and higher secondary schools in the state.A division bench of Justices Debangsu Basak and Shabbar Rashidi of the high court ordered that the candidates selected will have to return the entire salary drawn by them, along with an annualised interest of 12 per cent, within the next four weeks.Besides directing the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to start the recruitment process afresh, it also directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry on with its investigation into the matter.Taking cognisance of the state cabinet's decision for the creation of super-numeric posts, the Calcutta high court said that the CBI, if necessary, can question the masterminds behind the creation of the seats in excess of the vacant posts. These super-numeric posts, which have remained under the cloud since the beginning, are perceived to provide room for ineligible candidates recruited illegally.","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Calcutta high court's order terminating the appointment of 25,000 teachers recruited ""illegally"" in West Bengal.

The total sanctioned strength of judges across all HCs is 1,114, which means 29.4% posts are lying vacant.Large number of vacancies in high courts also means increasing pendency of cases, which has reached almost 62 lakh as on April 30.The total pendency in all courts has crossed 5.1 crore, including 4.5 crore in subordinate and district courts and over 80,000 in Supreme Court.Interestingly, for half of these vacancies, Centre had claimed earlier that no recommendations were made by HC collegiums when the laid down procedure demands initiating proposals well in advance, at least six months before the vacancy arises.Allahabad HC, country’s largest HC, has 69 vacancies against a strength of 160 judges, which means 43% posts are vacant. Gujarat HC has a higher vacancy percentage at 44%, followed by Patna and Rajasthan with 36% each.Punjab & Haryana HC has 30 posts vacant against a sanctioned strength of 85, followed by 26 in Bombay HC where the approved strength is 94. There are 23 vacancies each in Calcutta and Gujarat HCs.In Dec last year, while responding to MPs’ concerns against the large number of vacancies in high courts, Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal had pointed to the slow pace of recommendations reaching the Centre.He had said that HC collegiums were not adhering to timeline on initiation of recommendations against vacancies, adding that for 198 vacancies across HCs, collegiums of these HCs had not made any recommendations till then, leading to a huge backlog.According to the memorandum of procedure (MoP) that guides the appointment of judges to the higher judiciary, a proposal for appointment is initiated by the chief justice of the HC concerned in consultation with two senior-most judges of the HC at least six months before a vacancy occurs. “This timeline is often not adhered to by the high courts,” Meghwal had said.Once these HC collegiums recommend candidates for judgeship, the govt seeks Intelligence Bureau’s inputs and refers them to Supreme Court collegium, which finally selects and recommends names to Centre for notification. In cases where the SC collegium has reservations, those are referred back to the HCs for reconsideration.","Allahabad, Punjab and Haryana, Gujarat, Bombay and Calcutta alone have 171 vacancies.

“Without initiating adjudicatory proceedings (attachment action), can you initiate criminal proceedings?” The court noted that there were no attachment proceedings in the case so far.

“As far as the judgment in Manish Sisodia case is concerned, there are findings in his favour and against him also. Tell us which side this case (Kejriwal’s) lies.”

“How is Section 19 of PMLA to be interpreted, as he (Kejriwal) is coming against his arrest...instead of applying for bail, because he will have to face the higher threshold under Section 45 of PMLA if he takes the latter course? So how do we interpret it? Do we make the threshold much higher and ensure the standard is same to find the person who is guilty?”

CM arrested 18 months after case was filed, says counsel

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday said Enforcement Directorate would have to give an explanation on the timing of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s arrest, which was carried out just before general elections , and observed that the gap between initiation of proceedings in the alleged Delhi excise scam case and his arrest was “bothering” the court.At the conclusion of Kejriwal’s submission by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta asked additional solicitor general S V Raju to be ready with answers on Friday to five questions it raised on the basis of Singhvi’s arguments, including on the timing of arrest and the time-gap in proceedings against the CM.What is bothering us is the time gap between the initiation of proceedings and repeated complaints being filed after some time. If you see Section 8, there is a limit of 365 days. Other option is to not arrest... life and liberty are exceedingly important.”“Why was the arrest made right before Lok Sabha polls?”The agency will respond to the court’s queries on Friday. Singhvi, appearing for the CM, concluded his submission and contended that Kejriwal was arrested 18 months after the case was filed and that too on the basis of “hearsay evidence”. He gave a detailed timeline on how relief was granted to accused-turned-approvers soon after they named Kejriwal and were “forced by the agency to make statements against him”.In his affidavit, the CM has accused ED of working on behalf of the Centre to crush its political opponents ahead of general elections and said his arrest was “illegal, arbitrary and an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on free and fair elections and federalism”.“It is very sad and some kind of farce is going on. The agency is relying upon the statement of co-accused who were made to give statements prior to grant of pardon,” Singhvi said while referring to statements of Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy on the basis of which the chief minister was arrested.He said Reddy gave the statement five months after his son Raghav Reddy was arrested, and once the latter turned approver, ED on the very next day did not object to his bail plea.“The mode, manner and timing of the arrest of the petitioner just before Lok Sabha elections speaks volumes about the arbitrariness of the ED. This timeline establishes the fact that the petitioner has been arrested intentionally with a malafide intent without any necessity to arrest,” Kejriwal said in his affidavit.",Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta asked ED to be ready with answers on Friday.

The notice comes a day after the Uttarakhand govt suspended the licences for 14 products sold by Patanjali Ayurved and Divya Pharmacy, including popular offerings Swasari Gold, Mukta Vati Extra Power, and BP Grit.The penalty by DGGI Chandigarh stems from the detection of a Rs 20-crore irregularity in ITC, as GST officials revealed. According to GST officials, in case of a fake ITC claim, a penalty can be imposed up to the amount of the ITC claim along with interest. They said that in this case, the wrong ITC claim was Rs 20 crore, and the penalty amount is Rs 27.5 crore – inclusive of interest — hence, the total amount stands at Rs 47.5 crore. Despite attempts by TOI, Patanjali officials remained unresponsive for comment.Meanwhile, legal tussle escalated as Uttarakhand suspended licences for 14 Patanjali products, including those mentioned above. The state government also demanded the formula for these drugs from Patanjali. Speaking to TOI, Patanjali Ayurved media in-charge S K Tijarawala stated, “We will reply to the notice served by state govt and take legal recourse regarding the action taken against us.”This action follows a case filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in the Supreme Court after Patanjali published an advertisement claiming to cure various diseases, which the IMA deemed misleading. The apex court scrutinised govt's response to Patanjali Ayurved’s activities, criticising their passivity. Responding to the court’s queries, the state Ayurvedic and Unani Services department suspended the licences of the mentioned drugs under provisions of the Drug and Cosmetic Act 1945. Dr Mithlesh Kumar, the drug controller, stated, “Manufacturing permission for the mentioned drugs is suspended with immediate effect.”The legal confrontation deepened as the Ayurvedic and Unani services department of the Ayush ministry filed affidavits regarding the action taken against Patanjali. The department sought the apex court’s permission to file revised affidavits, and the case is scheduled for a hearing on May 14.","The penalty stems from the detection of a Rs 20-crore irregularity in ITC, as GST officials revealed.

‘Juvenile’ to suggest national wealth redistribution: SG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juvenile-to-suggest-national-wealth-redistribution-sg/articleshow/109738521.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid a growing debate on redistribution of wealth, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told Supreme Court on Tuesday that these were “rustic and juvenile” methods to achieve egalitarianism.Outlining that Article 39(b) of the Constitution envisaged distribution of material resources of the community to subserve the common good, Mehta told a nine-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud, “It would be a rustic and juvenile method to propose computing the nation’s wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and then distributing it equally among a particular section.Such ideas reflect a lack of understanding of economic development , governance, social welfare and the nation.”Mehta said if a plot of land belonged to an individual and it was needed for construction of a road to subserve the common good of residents of a large area, then that privately-owned land would be classified as material resource to be utilised for greater good of the community. “Article 39(b) based legislation is not meant to take away properties owned by people of a particular community, race or caste for distribution among another class of citizens,” he said.The bench comprising CJI Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih seemed to concur. “It would be rather extreme to interpret Article 39(b) to include privately-owned property as material resources of the community,"" the bench said.“The dynamics of economic development have changed from socialist pattern to a free market economy since the 1990s and now private investments hold the key. If we want to have a productive economy, then private investment must be encouraged. In the 1950s, no one had envisaged that electricity would be distributed by private parties. In the present scenario, it would be extremely unfair to argue that community resources include all private properties,” it added.CJI Chandrachud said when the constitutional court interprets a key provision like Article 39(b) in Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution, it must ensure that the interpretation “sends a clear message of what India is and what it aspires to be”.“It is difficult to outrightly categorise all private properties as material resources of the community. But at the same time, we cannot say that material resources can never include any private property,” he said, indicating that a balance needs to be struck between the two extreme views — socialist and capitalist — in the context of India's development.Mehta said Article 39(b) was a measure for developing a welfare state with the goal of achieving common good, where material resources of the community need legislative intervention to be either taken over or controlled for distribution. He said the govt did not advocate either extremes — that all assets of the country vested in the nation or community, or that no private property could ever be categorised as community resources. “It depends on the context of time and purpose,” he said.After hearing Mehta, the bench said, “Your arguments appear to contradict that of attorney general R Venkataramani who had argued that community resources would include private properties.” Mehta said he had nuanced the legal proposition differently. Arguments will conclude on Wednesday.",Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told Supreme Court on Tuesday that these were “rustic and juvenile’ methods to achieve egalitarianism.

NEW DELHI: South India experienced its second hottest April on record in terms of maximum temperatures while the average mean temperature in east and northeast India was the highest for the month in 51 years, IMD data reveals, attesting to the torridly hot conditions that these regions have been witnessing over the past few weeks.The last few days have seen heat records fall in three of India’s biggest cities — Bengaluru, Kolkata and Mumbai.The South as a whole recorded an average maximum temperature of nearly 37.2 degrees Celsius during the month — surpassed only by 37.6 degrees C logged in April 2016 in records going back to 1901 — IMD’s monthly temperature data reveals. Bengaluru witnessed its hottest ever April. The metro, once famous as the Garden City, recorded 13 extremely hot days, including six in a row, during the month.Eastern India has been baking in April heat during a prolonged spell of extreme weather. As per IMD’s data, the average mean temperature in the region (east and NE, as per IMD classification) during the month was the highest since 1973, with the average night temperatures the highest ever in April. Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar have been reeling under extreme heat. On Tuesday, Kolkata (Dum Dum) logged 43 degrees C, its highest temperature in April and fourth highest for any month. It was 43 degrees C at Kolkata’s Alipore as well, less than a degree from the all-time high of 43.9 recorded almost a century ago and only the second time ever that Kolkata’s April temperature had touched the 43-degree mark.Meanwhile, for the first time in the country this season, the mercury crossed the 47-degree mark on Tuesday — Kalaikunda in (Bengal) logged 47.2 degrees C, a whopping 10.4 degrees above normal, and Baharagora in East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand touched 47.1 degrees C. At least three spots in the region — Kalaikunda, Panagarh (Bengal) and Balasore (Odisha) — reported temperatures 10 degrees higher than normal.Odisha, which falls under central India in IMD’s classification, has been reeling under a heat wave for 16 straight days. “This is the highest number of consecutive days of heat wave in Odisha in 10 years. The record for the longest heat wave spell in the state is 26 days, reported in 1998,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, chief of IMD.“The heat waves in several parts of the country weren’t entirely unexpected. El Nino continues to persist in the Pacific and under this condition, south India and adjoining areas are known to witness above normal temperatures in April. A more immediate reason for the heat in eastern India is the presence of an anti-cyclonic circulation in central Bay of Bengal, which is preventing sea breeze from entering the region. As a result, the land has become dry and hot,” Mohapatra said.Another wind circulation, an anti-cyclone over western Arabian Sea, has been pumping up heat along the western coast, particularly the Konkan belt, over the past few days. On Monday, the temperature at Mumbai’s Santa Cruz crossed 39 degrees for the second time this month, making it the second hottest April day in the city in 10 years.IMD expects the heat wave to continue in eastern India till May 2 and for at least another five days in the South.","South India experienced its second hottest April on record in terms of maximum temperatures.

IPS officer compulsorily retired gets CAT relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ips-officer-compulsorily-retired-gets-cat-relief/articleshow/109738252.cms,"RAIPUR: Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has quashed IPS officer Gurjinder Pal Singh ’s compulsory retirement from service and ordered his reinstatement with all associated benefits within four weeks. The 1991-batch officer held the rank of ADG in Chhattisgarh when he was compulsorily retired from service after being raided by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and a sedition case was registered against him during the tenure of Bhupesh Baghel govt in state.CAT principal bench in New Delhi, comprising chairman, Justice Ranjit More, and member Anand Mathur, observed: “The applicant has been retired compulsorily as a punitive measure. The order of compulsory retirement has been passed as a shortcut to avoid departmental inquiry. The impugned order retiring the applicant compulsorily cannot be sustained in the eyes of the law.”In his submission before CAT, the IPS officer maintained that while working as ADGP-ACB/EOW, he was in-charge of high-profile and sensitive probes in state, including Nagrik Apoorti Nigam scam. During probe, he was repeatedly subjected to “political pressure from the higher echelons of state govt” to conduct probe as per their instructions, but he did not give in, he told the tribunal. This is why he was “unceremoniously” transferred to police HQ with no assignment and then made director of the state police academy, he said.“Govt, maliciously and after a lapse of over four years, constituted inquiry committee into suicide of Bilaspur SP Rahul Sharma,” he said, adding that he moved Jabalpur bench of the tribunal, which stayed panel proceedings.",The 1991-batch officer held the rank of ADG in Chhattisgarh.
