DHAKA: Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP on Tuesday urged India to extradite deposed PM Sheikh Hasina to face trial in murder and other cases registered against her since she took flight on August 5 in the face of a student-led uprising. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to government of Bangladesh in a legal way.The people of this country have given the decision for her trial.Let her face that trial,"" BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in Dhaka after paying tribute to the party's founder president Ziaur Rahman.Alamgir said Hasina being allowed to take refuge in India isn't aligned with the country's commitment to upholding democratic principles. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh.""Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated in courts for any ""extraditable crime"", including financial offences liable to invite a minimum punishment of a year in jail.BNP, whose ailing chairperson and ex-PM Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest after Hasina fled, said the murder and extortion cases filed against the latter were in the ""extraditable"" category.The bilateral treaty isn't applicable to cases that are ""political in nature"", although this exemption is not available to those charged with serious crimes like murder, sources said.India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have ""not been made in good faith and in the interests of justice"". The BNP secretary general alleged that Hasina's Awami League was ""still conspiring in New Delhi to falsify the victory"" of students and other citizens of Bangladesh. ""I am saying this strongly, and we want to make it clear that I do not think that India can get much love from the people by sheltering the enemy of the people of Bangladesh, who had to flee from the country,"" Alamgir said.Awami League has criticised Bangladesh's interim government for cases registered against Hasina, terming them ""false and politically motivated"".","Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated.

Sitting outside, it surprises you as a coach as well. We sometimes think what is he doing, but then you realise after a while what he has done,"" he said.Citing an example, Rathour mentioned one of Rohit's decisions during the T20 World Cup final earlier this year in June.""In the T20 World Cup final, he finished (Jasprit) Bumrah's overs early.

While there are currently no reported cases of Mpox in India, officials indicated that the risk of a widespread outbreak with sustained transmission remains low.Mishra also emphasised the critical importance of widely disseminating prevention and treatment protocols. He highlighted the necessity of launching an awareness campaign to educate healthcare providers on recognizing the signs and symptoms of Mpox and ensuring timely reporting to the surveillance system.The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ) due to its prevalence and spread across multiple African countries. An official source said that the current strain of the virus is more virulent and infectious, but the likelihood of a major outbreak in India is still considered low.According to WHO, since 2022, there have been 99,176 cases and 208 deaths due to Mpox reported from 116 countries globally. In 2023, the number of reported cases worldwide significantly increased, and this year, more than 15,600 cases and 537 deaths have already been recorded.

Here’s an overview of the trends from previous years-In 2022, the NEET Post Graduate exam result was declared by the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences within a record time of just 10 days from the date of the exam. Although the result was initially scheduled for June 20, 2022, it was released earlier on June 1, 2022.It is worth noting that prior to 2013, aspiring medical postgraduates in India competed for admission through the All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Exam (AIPGMEE). This exam was conducted to fill postgraduate seats in various medical colleges across the country. However, to streamline the medical entrance examination process and ensure a common platform for all aspirants, the AIPGMEE was replaced by NEET PG. Subsequently, after a period of transition the AIPGMEE exams were replaced with the NEET PG exams.The National Board of Examinations (NBE) will prepare the NEET PG 2024 results using a normalisation process similar to that used by AIIMS for other exams, including the INI CET. The normalisation process entails converting raw scores into percentiles to ensure fairness across multiple exam shifts.Candidates' final grades are calculated by first determining their raw scores and then converting them into percentiles. The top scorers, or toppers, are assigned a percentile of 100. All other candidates are assigned percentiles based on their relative performance. The top scorers in each shift of the NEET PG 2024 exam, which will be administered in multiple shifts, will receive a perfect score. To ensure precision, each candidate's percentile score will be calculated to seven decimal places.","The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) is expected to announce the NEET PG examination results soon. Candidates can check their results on the official website, natboard.edu.in.

NEW DELHI: After the Centre on Tuesday asked the UPSC to withdraw its advertisement for lateral entry into bureaucracy , a flurry of responses poured in from both sides of the aisle. While members from the BJP-NDA heaped praises for Prime Minister Modi's move to address ""social justice"", the INDIA bloc, on the other hand, termed it a ""victory for the Constitution"" and praised Leader of Opposition for spearheading the campaign against the government's move.The Centre's decision came amid increasing criticism from both the opposition and the NDA allies.The BJP-NDA hailed Prime Minister Modi for intervening personally on the matter and making ""social justice"" a cornerstone of his policy. In his letter minister of state for personnel, Jitendra Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes that lateral entry should be in line with ""principles of equity and social justice,"" particularly regarding ""provisions of reservation.""""While most of the major lateral entries before 2014 were made in an ad-hoc manner, including cases of alleged favouritism, efforts of our government have been to make the process institutionally driven, transparent and open. The Prime Minister is of the firm belief that the process of lateral entry must be aligned with the principles of equity and social justice enshrined in our Constitution, particularly concerning the provisions of reservation.""The Union minister Chirag Paswan , who was the first leader within the NDA to voice concerns against the lateral entry scheme, was ""relieved"" and ""happy"" after the government in a surprising reversal decided to hold the move back. “I am happy that my Prime Minister Modiji understood the concerns of SC/ST and backward people. My party LJP (Ram Vilas) and I thank PM Modi,” he told news agency PTI.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also hailed Prime Minister Modi for having reaffirmed his commitment to the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar by implementing reservation principles in Union Public Service Commission lateral entry. “PM Modi ensured that Babasaheb Ambedkar’s five sacred places are given their proper status.

The Raebareli MP also reiterated that they will continue to fight for social justice based on ""caste census"".""We will protect the Constitution and the reservation system at all costs. We will foil conspiracies like BJP's 'lateral entry' at any cost, "" he wrote on X, hours after the Centre's decision.Reacting to the development, Congress chief Kharge said, ""Long live the Constitution! The Congress party's fight for social justice for our Dalits, tribals, backward and weaker sections has foiled the BJP's plans to snatch away reservation."" He said it was due to the campaign run by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress and INDIA bloc parties, that the government has taken a step back.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said on X, ""A letter from a Union minister working under a non-biological PM to a Constitutional authority without a date.

Congress leader Supriya Srinate said that the cancellation of the latest advertisement for lateral entry into the bureaucracy is a ""victory"" of India's Constitution"", and added it was possible because of the opposition led by Rahul Gandhi.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, meanwhile, said the ""conspiracy of making appointments through the back door of lateral entry in UPSC by rejecting reservation has finally succumbed to the unity of PDA"". He also hailed this a ""big victory"" and claimed the setback to have ""exposed"" the ""anti-reservation face of BJP"".BSP chief Mayawati claimed that the Centre has withdrawn the advertisement for recruitment to bureaucracy through lateral entry after her party's opposition to the move, saying that ""all such anti-reservation processes"" need to be stopped.Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin exuded confidence that a ""strong opposition"" from the INDIA bloc was able to push the BJP led NDA govt to retract from proceeding with the recruitment process under lateral entry.

70 missions to be launched in 5 years; first uncrewed Gaganyaan launch in December: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-missions-to-be-launched-in-5-years-first-uncrewed-gaganyaan-launch-in-december-isro-chief/articleshow/112666553.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro chairman S Somanath said on Tuesday that the space agency is going to launch 50+ satellites and several scientific missions totalling 70 launches for various users, departments and ministries in the next five years. He also said the country’s first uncrewed Gaganyaan mission is likely to be launched in December this year.Somanath revealed this on the sidelines of a function organised by AICTE in collaboration with Isro, Indian Space Association (ISpA), and IN-SPACe, titled “Creating a Space Ecosystem: A New Era—Igniting Young Minds for Space Exploration.” The event also featured the launch of the AICTE-approved model curriculum for space technology and the release of a book titled ‘Introduction to Finite Element Analysis’, co-authored by Isro chief S Somanath and Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre director S Unnikrishnan Nair.Elaborating on the upcoming satellites to be launched, the Isro chief said over 50+ upcoming satellite missions will include four navigation satellites, weather satellites, Cartosat series, Resourcesat series, Oceansat and high-throughput communication satellites.After the successful moon landing on Aug 23 last year, which will be celebrated as National Space Day, Somanath said Isro has completed design work for Chandrayaan-4 and -5 missions. “We are now waiting for the govt’s approval,” he said.About Bharatiya Antariksha Station project, Somanath said India’s space station will have five modules. The first module is scheduled to be launched in 2028. Design work for it is already completed and a full report has been submitted to govt for approval.”On the first Gaganyaan unmanned mission, Somanath said “most of the rocket stages have reached SHAR (Sriharikota). Only the crew module is being prepared at Thiruvananthapuram (centre) and the service module at UR Rao Satellite Centre (Bengaluru). All systems will reach Sriharikota in one and a half months and the launch will be in December.”After the successful launch of the final development flight of SSLV (mini rocket) recently, Somanath said, “We are now working on SSLV technology transfer. The technology will be transferred either to a company or a consortium of companies based on who will be the highest bidder. A request for interest has been floated and more than 10 companies and consortia have evinced interest. Some of them have been shortlisted. After the approved price is paid, two rockets will be realised on a commercial basis by the company as Isro and NSIL will hand-hold the company. Thereafter, they will manufacture the rockets on their own.”The Isro chief also gave details about the next-generation launches. “We have a rocket LVM-3 with a 4-5 tonne carrying capability. We need to double this capability. Though the cost of the existing rocket is high, it is still competitive. But we have to bring the cost down substantially. So, we are going for a PPP mode to develop a next-generation rocket.”About ongoing astronaut training in the US for the International Space Station mission, Somanath said the two astronauts are “currently undergoing an initial phase of a three-month training (in Houston). Thereafter, they will be trained in other facilities”. “One of them will then be sent to ISS, which is likely in the middle of next year,” he said.Lieutenant General AK Bhatt, director general of ISpA, who was also at the event, said, “ISpA is actively working to facilitate private sector participation in India's space economy and we believe that the synergy between the govt initiatives and private enterprises will be the key driver of innovation and growth in this sector. We need increased collaboration between the academia, the industry and the research institutions to foster innovation and accelerate technological development. Investment in STEM education is crucial to nurture the next generation of space scientists and engineers.”",Isro chairman S Somanath said on Tuesday that the space agency is going to launch 50+ satellites and several scientific missions totalling 70 launches in the next five years.

social justice

NEW DELHI: Faced with opposition, government on Tuesday cancelled the move to recruit 45 mid-level bureaucrats through "" lateral entry "" and announced the extension of quotas to such inductions as well.Government asked Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) to withdraw the advertisement for 45 lateral inductions for the posts of joint secretaries, directors and deputy secretaries, in what is being seen as a swift response to allegations from Congress and others in the opposition that the Centre had been making appointments laterally to dodge the requirement for caste quotas.BJP's ally, Union food processing minister Chirag Paswan of LJP had also opposed the decision.""Today, PM Narendra Modi has reaffirmed his commitment to Babasaheb's Constitution and has taken a major decision to apply the principles of reservation in lateral recruitment by UPSC... (This) clearly shows the commitment of PM to take the benefit and to do justice to the weakest section of society,"" I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnav told DD News.Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UPSC chairperson Preeti Sudan, personnel minister Jitendra Singh urged her to cancel the ad for lateral entry positions following instructions from the PM, and referred to Modi's decision to apply quotas to lateral entries.Personnel minister Jitendra Singh also mentioned that reservation in employment is a cornerstone of government’s social justice framework, aimed at addressing historical injustices and promoting inclusivity. “It is important that the constitutional mandate towards social justice is upheld so that deserving candidates from marginalised communities get their rightful representation in government services,” Singh said in his letter to the UPSC chief.Opposition celebrated the decision as its “victory” and emphasised that it forced government to retrace its steps. government, for its part, said lateral inductions, without provision for caste quotas, began under Congress governments.Singh said the policy for lateral inductions, where quotas are not applied because positions are treated as “specialist” “single-cadre” posts would be reviewed and changed in context of PM’s “focus on ensuring social justice”. Under current norms, quota system is not applicable where there are less than three recruitments.Officials said government will “undertake an exercise” to see how reservation norms can be applied in lateral entry. “government has followed due process that’s fair and transparent in the last three batches of lateral entry. Now since it has been pointed out that there should be reservation in such recruitment as well and as there is a sentiment, government will review this. We are open to suggestions,” said a senior official.Sources said of the currently serving 57 officers recruited through lateral entry, four are SC and eight OBC. A senior official said the current norm of reservation in direct recruitment — 15.7% for SCs, 7% for STs, 27% for OBCs and 10% for economically weaker section (EWS) — can be applied only when all posts for each category are clubbed and not taken as single-cadre posts.In the letter, Singh referred to how lateral entry was endorsed by Second Administrative Reforms Commission chaired by Congress’ Veerappa Moily and that recommendations of sixth pay commission in 2013 were in the same direction.The minister said there have been many instances of high profile appointments, including of secretaries without following any process of reservation.Taking on previous Congress-led UPA governments, the letter mentioned, “...it is well known that members of the infamous National Advisory Council used to run a super-bureaucracy that controlled PMO.”Slamming Congress for double standards, I&B minister Ashwini asked, “Manmohan Singh ji, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and before that Vijay Kelkar ji became finance secretary through lateral entry. Did Congress take care of principle of reservation at that time?”","Government asked Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) to withdraw the advertisement for 45 lateral inductions for the posts of joint secretaries, directors and deputy secretaries.

NEW DELHI: The hurried cancellation of advertisement for lateral recruitment of mid-tier bureaucrats by Modi government Tuesday signals BJP's recognition of opposition 's plan to hurt it by hurling the quota card .In bringing up the issue of reservations in lateral entries, opposition had picked up from where it left off in its Lok Sabha election campaign when it turned BJP's ambition to post a 400+ score to its advantage by alleging that the bid for super majority was meant to scrap caste quotas by amending the Constitution.BJP took time to grasp the seriousness of the threat and by the time it woke up, opposition's campaign, analysis of results shows, found takers who did not consider the party's rebuttals to be convincing.This time, the party responded with alacrity.Although it strongly defended the policy over the weekend by pointing out that lateral entries date back to the days of first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, a re-think, sources indicated Monday, was already underway, with govt choosing not just to back-pedal but do one better by introducing quotas in lateral entries: something which may not sit exactly well with the objective to bring in specialists for jobs requiring special skills.The upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, each home to sizable constituencies with direct stake in quota, also appear to have weighed in with the party and the govt.With Supreme Court verdict on sub-categorisation of SCs putting the spotlight on caste census that it has opposed, BJP obviously feels the need to use its political capital wisely insofar as the twin issues of caste and quotas are concerned.The public stand taken by ally, LJP's Chirag Paswan, would have only emphasised the need for early damage-elimination. It acted with considerable speed turning down top court's recommendation for introduction of 'creamy layer' concept in quotas for SCs and STs, stealing a march over many of its opponents who were still working out their stand.It may not just be a coincidence that the advertisement for lateral recruitment came a day ahead of Bharat Bandh called by Dalit outfits to oppose top court's verdict on sub-categorisation of SCs and STs.","BJP's cancellation of advertisement for lateral recruitment of mid-tier bureaucrats signals recognition of opposition's plan to hurt it by hurling the quota card.

"Remove victim’s name, videos from electronic, social media: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/remove-victims-name-videos-from-electronic-social-media-supreme-court/articleshow/112663244.cms,"NEW DELHI: Strongly disapproving revelation of identity of the doctor, who was sexually assaulted prior to her murder at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital at Kolkata on August 9, and the circulation of video clips of the body, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered immediate deletion of such posts from social and electronic media.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra passed this order on a PIL filed by advocate Kinnori Ghosh and others who argued that the revelation of the sexual assault victim's name and circulation of the video clips of the body were in breach of the SC's 2018 judgment in Nipun Saxena as also Section 72 of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita.The CJI-led bench passed the ex-parte direction for deletion of these posts as it found that such lapses on part of persons posting these on social media and electronic media were not only in violation of law and SC order but an affront to the dignity and privacy of the victim.During the earlier hearing in the morning session, the same bench said, ""We are deeply concerned that the name and identity of the deceased, who was raped and murdered, was revealed all over the media. Photographs have been all over the media. Video clips of her body, either before or after the postmortem, have been published.""It is extremely concerning. We are the first to recognise the right to free speech. But there are well settled parameters which have been laid down in the new criminal code. There are judgements which ruled that names of sexual assault survivors cannot be revealed.Appearing for West Bengal, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said he entirely agreed with the bench and informed the court that the state police have so far filed 50 FIRs on this breach by social and electronic media. ""These photographs were taken before police reached the crime scene. We did not allow any such thing to happen thereafter,"" he said.The CJI said, ""Is this the way we provide dignity to a deceased who was sexually assaulted? An individual who lost her life was a young doctor. Everyone must exercise restraint in such cases.""In Nipun Saxena judgment of December 11, 2018, the SC had said, ""No person can print or publish in print, electronic, social media, etc. the name of the victim or even in a remote manner disclose any facts which can lead to the victim being identified and which should make her identity known to the public at large.""""In cases where the victim is dead or of unsound mind the name of the victim or her identity should not be disclosed even under the authorisation of the next of the kin, unless circumstances justifying the disclosure of her identity exist, which shall be decided by the competent authority, which at present is the sessions judge,"" the SC had said. Following this the Union home ministry had issued general direction incorporating the above ruling of SC.",Supreme Court orders immediate deletion of such posts from social and electronic media.

SC sets aside Calcutta high court order advising adolescent girls to 'control sexual urges',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sets-aside-calcutta-high-court-order-advising-adolescent-girls-to-control-sexual-urges/articleshow/112663222.cms,"NEW DELHI: Strongly disapproving of the sweeping observations made by the Calcutta high court , including advising adolescent girls to control their sexual urges instead of giving in to ""two minutes of pleasure"" while deciding a criminal appeal , the Supreme Court on Tuesday urged judges to decide cases based on law and facts and not to indulge in preaching or expressing personal opinions in adjudication.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan not only set aside the high court's remarks but also its verdict in 2018 of acquitting an accused who was in physical relationship with a 14-year old minor girl and out of which a child was born.The top court convicted him under the Pocso Act and said it would decide on the quantum of punishment. It also directed West Bengal govt to form a committee of three experts, including a clinical psychologist and a social scientist, to interact with the girl to help her make an informed choice whether she wants to continue to remain in the company of the accused or avail of the state's benefits.Referring to various observations made by the HC, including carving out a non-existing category of ""romantic relationships"" in rape cases and suggesting amendment in laws to decriminalise consensual sexual acts involving adolescents above 16 years, the court said the HC's remarks were shocking.""A judgment of the court cannot contain the judge's personal opinions on various subjects. Similarly, advisory jurisdiction cannot be exercised by the court by incorporating advice to the parties or advice in general. The judge has to decide a case and not preach. The judgment cannot contain irrelevant and unnecessary material. A judgment must be in simple language and should not be verbose. Brevity is the hallmark of quality judgment. We must remember that judgment is neither a thesis nor a piece of literature. However, we find that the impugned judgment contains personal opinion of the Judges advice to the younger generation and advice to the legislature,"" the court said.The bench agreed that the relationship was consensual as there was no evidence of enticing the victim and she had left the house on her own but held that the offences punishable under Section 6 of Pocso Act and Sub- sections (2)(n) and (3) of Section 376 of the IPC were made out. It said whether such offence arises from a romantic relationship is irrelevant. The court also expressed concern over the Child Welfare Committees in states not doing its job in reaching out to the children in need of care and protection.""It is the responsibility of the State to take care of helpless victims of such heinous offences. Time and again, we have held that the right to live a dignified life is an integral part of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution... The minor child, who is the victim of the offences under the Pocso Act, is also deprived of the fundamental right to live a dignified and healthy life. The same is the case of the child born to the victim as a result of the offence... Therefore immediately after the knowledge of the commission of a heinous offence under the Pocso Act, the State, its agencies and instrumentalities must step in and render all possible aid to the victim children, which will enable them to lead a dignified life,"" the bench said.",Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan not only set aside the high court's remarks but also its verdict in 2018 of acquitting an accused who was in physical relationship with a 14-year old minor girl. The top court convicted him under the Pocso Act and said it would decide on the quantum of punishment.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112663236,imgsize-802277,width-400,resizemode-4/112663236.jpg"

Political activities surge as Election Commission issues J&K poll notification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-activities-surge-as-election-commission-issues-jk-poll-notification/articleshow/112662991.cms,"SRINAGAR: Political activities across J&K intensified following Tuesday’s notification by EC for the first round of the three-phase assembly elections on September 18 — following a decade-long gap and the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the region into two Union territories, including Ladakh.This round will cover 24 of the 90 constituencies — 16 in Kashmir valley and eight in Jammu division.With the notification, the nomination process has officially begun. Candidates have until August 27 to submit their nominations, with scrutiny set for August 28. The final date for withdrawal of candidature is August 30.While parties like National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Congress, and BJP remain major players, Baramulla’s independent MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh, better known as Engineer Rashid, might upend the equation.Arrested in 2019 by NIA and currently imprisoned in New Delhi’s Tihar jail on terrorism-funding charges, Rashid defeated NC vice president Omar Abdullah and People’s Conference president Sajad Gani Lone in the Lok Sabha polls .Rashid’s brother Sheikh Khurshid, a government teacher, resigned from his job to focus on the elections. “I will be working with my two nephews to make the party vibrant. We are optimistic about winning several seats. My brother’s victory in Lok Sabha elections, where he secured more than 4.7 lakh votes and defeated political heavyweights, demonstrates AIP’s growing popularity,” Khurshid said. Rashid’s sons — Abrar and Asrar — campaigned on his behalf in the Lok Sabha polls and will fill in for their father again this time.The political momentum behind Rashid’s Awami Itehad Party (AIP) has been growing lately as several politicians have defected to his side. AIP plans to field multiple candidates in both north and south Kashmir and could potentially secure several seats, positioning itself as a key player in the formation of the new govt. AIP general secretary Prince Parvaiz is the potential candidate for Bandipora.Key constituencies voting on September 18 include Pampore, Tral, Pulwama, Shopian, Anantnag East and West, and Pahalgam, predominantly in south Kashmir. In Jammu region, seats such as Inderwal, Kishtwar, Doda, and Ramban will be contested.As voting day nears, shifting allegiances and strategic alliances are likely to shape the scenario. Resignations have already hit political parties. Key figures such as Harbaksh Singh from Tral and PDP chief spokesperson Syed Suhail Bukhari left their parties Tuesday. Singh accused both PDP and NC of neglecting minority communities, while expressing hope that AIP “won’t repeat such things”.Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari’s J&K Apni Party has been witnessing mass resignations, with members either joining PDP, NC, or AIP. Apni Party politician Zaffar Manhas and his son are expected to join Congress during Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi’s visit to J&K for two days, starting Wednesday.Congress MP Gandhi will likely finalise a pre-poll alliance and a seat-sharing formula with NC. Though NC members had earlier dismissed any formal alliances, a party functionary said an agreement with Congress is likely, with the parties dividing seats between south Kashmir and Hindu-dominated constituencies in Jammu.After the 2023 delimitation, the new J&K assembly will have 47 legislators from Kashmir division and 43 from Jammu. According to political analysts, BJP is likely to win around 30 seats in Jammu.During the Lok Sabha polls, BJP had asked Kashmiris to vote for any candidate other than the “dynastic troika” of NC, PDP and Congress. However, the results were surprising. BJP retained two seats in Jammu but failed in Kashmir and Ladakh. NC won two of the three Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti is also gaining traction, despite losing the Lok Sabha polls to NC’s Mian Altaf in Anantnag-Rajouri. Former J&K minister Abdul Haq Khan re-joined PDP Tuesday after nearly two years away from the party.","First round of three-phase assembly elections on September 18.

Bharat Bandh 2024: Authorities on high alert

Bharat Bandh August 21: What’s closed and what’s open?

Markets and businesses: The organising group has requested that all business establishments close for the day. However, it remains uncertain whether markets will indeed shut down nationwide. Market committees have not yet confirmed widespread closures. Local variations are expected, and businesses are advised to check with local authorities for specific guidance.

Public transport: Public transport, including metro services, may experience disruptions. While some services might be partially operational, delays and cancellations are anticipated. Commuters should plan their travels accordingly and consider alternative modes of transportation if necessary.

Schools and colleges: Educational institutions such as schools and colleges are expected to remain open despite the bandh. However, attendance may be lower due to potential disruptions in transportation. Parents and students should stay informed about any specific instructions from their institutions.

Government offices and banks: Government offices and banks are likely to function normally. There may be some impact on services due to reduced staff and increased security measures, but essential services are expected to continue.

Emergency services: Emergency services, including medical services, ambulances, drinking water supply, public transport, rail services, and electricity services, will remain operational. These services are crucial for maintaining public safety and health, and authorities have assured that they will be unaffected by the bandh.

Impact on daily life due to Bharat Bandh

On August 21, 2024, India will witness a nationwide protest known as the Bharat Bandh , organised by the Reservation Bachao Sangharsh Samiti in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling on SC/ST reservations. This bandh is expected to have a significant impact across various sectors. Here’s a comprehensive guide on what to expect on this day.According to an ET report, the Supreme Court of India recently ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) for the purposes of reservation.The decision is aimed at ensuring that those who are most in need within these groups receive priority. However, this ruling has sparked widespread controversy and opposition from several social and political organisations. Critics argue that it undermines the principles of reservation and could lead to increased division among communities. The Bharat Bandh is a response to this ruling, with the aim of challenging and reversing it.In preparation for the bandh, law enforcement agencies have heightened their alert levels. A high-level meeting, including divisional commissioners, district magistrates, and senior police officers, was held to ensure effective management of the situation, as per reports. Western Uttar Pradesh has been identified as a particularly sensitive area, and extra precautions have been taken there. DGP UR Sahoo stated, ""We have asked our officials to organise meetings with groups calling for the bandh, as well as with market associations, to facilitate better cooperation.""While the Bharat Bandh is designed to protest the Supreme Court ruling, its impact will vary depending on location. Urban areas might experience more significant disruptions compared to rural regions. Individuals are advised to stay updated through local news and government announcements to navigate the potential disruptions effectively.","The Bharat Bandh will take place on August 21, 2024.
