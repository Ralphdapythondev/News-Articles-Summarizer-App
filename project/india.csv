Afghanistan's economy faces tough times three years after Taliban return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/afghanistan-economy-faces-tough-times-three-years-after-taliban-return/articleshow/112509318.cms,"Here are some human stories amid Taliban rule:

Afghanistan 's economy continues to face challenges three years after the Taliban 's insurgency ended, despite security improvements. The United Nations reports that a significant portion of the population relies on minimal sustenance, and widespread unemployment persists.The World Bank cautions that economic growth may stagnate in the coming years.Nevertheless, the Taliban government has made some progress since taking control in 2021, although it lacks international recognition.The Afghan currency has remained stable, corruption has decreased, and tax collection has improved.The government has also established economic, trade, and investment ties in the region, according to Ahmad Zahid, the deputy commerce and industry minister.Afghanistan possesses significant potential in minerals and agriculture, but developing these sectors is hindered by inadequate infrastructure, expertise, and investment.Azizullah Rehmati, a businessman in Herat, is thriving despite the challenges. His saffron company is poised for growth, and the improved security has eliminated the need for armed guards. However, he faces difficulties due to the crippled banking sector and the closure of embassies, which complicate international transactions and travel.In contrast, Wahid Nekzai Logari, a former musician in Afghanistan's national orchestra, has been left jobless due to the Taliban's ban on public music performances. He occasionally works as a taxi driver to support his family but earns significantly less than he did as a musician, reports AFP.Abdul Wali Shaheen, a former Taliban fighter, now works at the Department of Information and Culture in Ghazni province. Although his new job is more stressful, his salary is sufficient to support his family, and he is optimistic about the country's progress under the Taliban.Sayeda, a beautician in Kabul, secretly reopened her salon after beauty salons were ordered to close. Despite the risks of being discovered by the authorities, she continues to operate to provide an income for herself and her employees, albeit with a reduced customer base and salary.","Afghanistan's economy continues to face challenges three years after the Taliban's insurgency ended.

"‘Burst of rainfall’ caused by human-induced climate change to blame for Wayanad landslides, say researchers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/140-mm-of-rain-lashed-wayanad-in-a-single-day-study/articleshow/112507580.cms,"NEW DELHI: A scientific study has attributed the July 30 devastating Wayanad landslides to a “burst of rainfall” triggered by human-induced climate change . It said more than 140 mm of rains fell in a single day - equivalent to nearly a quarter of London's annual rainfall - on soils that were already highly saturated following two months of seasonal monsoon rains in Kerala.A group of 24 researchers from India, US, UK, Sweden, Netherlands and Malaysia, who conducted the study, noted that though such an extreme event is expected to occur on average about “once every 50 years” under the current global warming of 1.2 degree celsius, people in northern Kerala can be saved from future landslides and floods only with “minimising deforestation and quarrying, while improving early warning and evacuation systems”.The study under the World Weather Attribution (WWA) shows that the event was the third heaviest one-day rainfall episode on record in the region, with heaviest spells in 2019 and 1924, where the climate change made the downpours 10% heavier, triggering the deadly landslides.“The Wayanad landslides is another catastrophic example of climate change playing out in real-time... Until the world replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy, monsoon downpours will continue to intensify, bringing landslides, floods and misery to India,” said Mariam Zachariah, researcher at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London.On prior alerts issue that put the Centre and the Kerala govt at loggerhead, the study underlined that though the extreme rainfall was well forecast by the IMD and warnings were issued, the information was at the state-level, making it difficult to discern which localities would be impacted by landslides (one of the potential impacts of heavy rainfall listed in the warning) and would therefore require evacuation.“The findings reported here are physically consistent with those predicted by climate science... These direct threats to people in India will continue to escalate as the climate warms and humans continue to regulate natural systems,” said Arpita Mondal, associate professor, IIT Bombay.The WWA study, released on Wednesday, flagged that if the world does not move away from fossil fuels, causing global warming to reach 2 degree Celsius, one-day spells of rainfall in Kerala will become a further 4% heavier, risking even more destructive landslides.WWA is an international collaboration that analyses and communicates the possible influence of climate change on extreme weather events, such as storms, extreme rainfall, heatwaves, and droughts.",A scientific study has attributed the July 30 devastating Wayanad landslides to a “burst of rainfall” triggered by human-induced climate change.

It's instead planning to manufacture 24-coach sleeper version of these modern trains that can travel at higher speeds.Sources said besides high cost, manufacture of these trains with aluminium coaches requires import of foreign technology.They added that focus is on bringing down prices and use of indigenous technologies.Last year, railways had cancelled its Rs 30,000 crore tender for procuring 100 Vande Bharat trains with aluminium coaches after it found the cost quoted by lowest bidder Alstom India was high. Sources said the French rolling stock company had quoted Rs 150.9 crore per trainset, but railways' tender panel had recommended that the price shouldn't be more than Rs 140 crore. They said Alstom India had intended to close the deal for approximately Rs 145 crore per trainset. But no agreement could be reached and the tender was cancelled. Prior to this, railways had bid out a contract to manufacture 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trainsets at Rs 120 crore per rake.Aluminum-bodied trainsets were chosen by railways and it had floated a tender last year since these are lower in weight and more energy efficient than standard stainless steel. Till now the national transporter has awarded contracts to procure 102 Vande Bharat with chair cars and another 200 with sleeper facility.An Alstom spokesperson said the company's offer for 100 aluminium trains was a very competitive offer, and the lowest when benchmarked against similar trains produced globally.",Railways may not go for aluminum-bodied Vande Bharat trains with sleeper facility because of high cost.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

'Making excuses is where our country will win gold medals': Gavaskar backs Prakash Padukone over Lakshya Sen criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/making-excuses-is-where-our-country-will-win-gold-medals-gavaskar-backs-prakash-padukone-over-lakshya-sen-criticism/articleshow/112470389.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar voiced his support for badminton legend Prakash Padukone after he called for players to take responsibility and accountability following Lakshya Sen 's defeat in the bronze medal match at the Paris Olympics last week.Lakshya let slip an opening game advantage and an 8-3 lead in the second, ultimately losing 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in a 71-minute match.Lakshya succumbing to the pressure left Padukone miffed as the former All England Open champion said it's high time that players learn to withstand pressure, become accountable and start delivering results after receiving support.However, Padukone's remarks sparked division within the badminton community, with doubles player Ashwini Ponnappa stating that his comments were equivalent to ""throwing the player under the bus.""But Padukone got the backing from none other than Gavaskar, who said our country has mastered the art of making excuses and would win gold medals every time if it were a competitive discipline.""He has always been reticent and publicity-shy, and he goes about his life with as much quiet as his famous dribble at the net. Therefore, his frank comments after the badminton disappointment came as a surprise to so many who have known him over the years to keep his counsel and not say much.""It also stirred up a debate where the majority tried, as is the modern way, to take the side of a current would-be champion and not that of a past-proven world champion. Making excuses is where our country will win gold medals every single time, so the debate around his assessment was more about that than looking without tinted glasses at what he said,"" Gavaskar wrote in a column for Sportstar.""And what did he say? He said that the players today get all the backing and facilities from their Federations and the government too. Therefore, they should take responsibility for their performances too. It was a point well-made and well-articulated too, without pointing fingers at anybody. Yet as it invariably happens in our country, which again is a champion at reading between so-called lines and imagining unintended poisoned arrows, we were quick to jump on him and denounce his comments rather than take the time to digest them and then come out with our comparatively uninformed views.""If a player is not going to take responsibility for his performance, then who is? So what wrong did he say? Some say the timing was wrong, but it's always better to say that when a player is searching for excuses and support rather than later. Yes, he could have said that privately in the changing room, but believe me, nothing has more impact on a player than a public rebuke. If he has the heart of a champion, then he will want to make the person who rebuked him eat his words. Otherwise, he will continue to flatter only to deceive,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar drew a parallel between Lakshya's performance and a recent comment made by the Indian cricket team Rohit Sharma. He had previously used the phrase ""Garden Main Ghoomne Vala"" to describe a certain situation.""To then see a 20-17 and 7-0 lead being squandered off in the semifinal and then lose the bronze medal match after winning the first game comfortably must have been gut-wrenching indeed. He, Vimal Kumar, the BAI and the government's TOPS had done everything possible, but when it came to the crunch, Lakshya was, in the famous words of the Indian cricket team captain,"" garden mein ghoomne wala,"" wrote Gavaskar.""For those who watched both the semifinal and the bronze medal matches, it did appear that Lakshya had lost his trend of thought and concentration in the way he looked at his racquet as he sipped from his water bottle in between points or at the changeovers. I could be completely wrong, but on TV, it looked like a blank expression, and that's usually a sign that the mind has wandered.""Concentration and focus are things that no coach or trainer can ever teach. It can be developed over the years by the athlete by observing other champions and having an inner resolve, but there's no specific programme for it. Yes, mind trainers are around, but they can only do so much and not more. It's got to be within the athlete,"" Gavaskar further stated.","Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar voiced his support for badminton legend Prakash Padukone. He said it's high time that players learn to withstand pressure, become accountable and start delivering results after receiving support. Lakshya Sen lost 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112470428,imgsize-73896,width-400,resizemode-4/112470428.jpg"
"Eye on China & Pakistan, India fast-tracks deal for 31 US 'hunter-killer' drones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-pakistan-india-fast-tracks-deal-for-31-us-hunter-killer-drones/articleshow/112505123.cms,"NEW DELHI: With both China and Pakistan bolstering their fleets of armed drones , India is fast-tracking negotiations for the acquisition of 31 weaponised MQ-9B `hunter-killer’ remotely-piloted aircraft from the US, with the somewhat ambitious aim to ink the mega deal by November-December this year.Techno-commercial discussions for the inter-governmental contract for the 31 armed high-altitude, long endurance drones “are in an advanced stage now”, with 15 Sea Guardians earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, defence ministry sources told TOI.This comes at a time when China, which continues the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh for the fifth year running now, has stepped-up supplies of its armed Cai Hong-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan. “Pakistan has sought 16 more armed CH-4 drones from China. It already has seven CH-4 drones in the Army and 3 in Navy,” a source said.The MQ-9B Reaper or Predator-B drones, designed to fly for around 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet for surveillance and armed with Hellfire air-to-ground missiles and smart bombs for precision strikes, are considered far superior to Chinese armed drones.The operational utility of the MQ-9B drones has been reinforced by extensive ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions being undertaken by the two unarmed Sea Guardian drones -- taken on lease from US firm General Atomics -- both over the vast Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as well as along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China.While the US has put a price tag of $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore) for the 31 weaponised MQ-9B drones and associated equipment, including 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, the Indian negotiating team is working to bring the costs down.“The price and terms offered by the US govt and General Atomics to other countries is being taken into account. All efforts are underway to conclude the deal within this calendar year after the final nod from the cabinet committee on security,” a source said.Under the deal, the drones will be assembled in India, while General Atomics will also source some components from Indian companies as well as set up a global MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here.“Since General Atomics cannot give transfer of technology for the varied sub-systems it sources from other companies, it will provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and other entities to develop such advanced drones indigenously,” the source said.The armed forces hope to induct the first 10 MQ-9B drones within a couple of years of the contract being inked, though it will depend on General Atomics’ production capacity. The rest will come in batches every six months.The plan is to deploy the fighter-size drones at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the Indian Ocean region and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders. “With their long-distance hunting and killing capabilities, such drones are required at a time when China’s naval forays into the IOR are only going to increase further,” an officer said.","The MQ-9B Reaper or Predator-B drones are designed to fly for around 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet for surveillance and armed with Hellfire air-to- ground missiles and smart bombs for precision strikes.

"Irked by rally, Supreme Court threatens to cancel bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/irked-by-rally-supreme-court-threatens-to-cancel-bail/articleshow/112504924.cms,"Times View It has happened in the past that politicians accused of serious crimes have celebrated the occasion of being given bail like an acquittal. The apex court has rightly warned against over the top displays on such occasions.

NEW DELHI: Politicians , imprisoned for alleged crimes, are typically greeted by unruly celebrations by their supporters when they get bail, leading to inconvenience to the public. In what could be a cautionary tale for them, SC Tuesday took a serious view of the practice and threatened to cancel the bail it had granted to an alleged criminal of Maharashtra's Newasa for taking out a motorcade and getting showered with flowers by a JCB machine.Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013. His bail plea in the murder case was rejected by trial court and Bombay HC bench at Aurangabad considering his criminal antecedents, absconding during pendency of trial and tactics to delay trial.On Tuesday, the complainant in the case, which related to murder of advocate Riyaz Pathan, complained before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan that days after SC granted bail considering that he has undergone almost a decade of incarceration, the accused roamed around Newasa town in a huge motorcade apparently to terrorise witnesses.Seeking cancellation of Sopan Gade's bail, complainant Asif Khan told SC that ""On Dec 16 last year, to create his fear among the people, Sopan organised a rally in his four-wheeler accompanied by 100 to 150 four-wheelers and 70 to 80 two-wheelers. It was telecast live on social media. They burst crackers, showered flowers from JCB to felicitate the accused. The motorcade caused a traffic jam on the NH for five to six hours.""The bench was furious and said it has become a habit with leaders to go around the town with supporters in a rally after getting bail. When Sopan's counsel said his supporters arranged the rally, the bench said, ""You file an apology for going in a motorcade and organising a rally.

CBI takes over

Doctors' body calls off strike

NEW DELHI: Following the Calcutta high court's order, the Central Bureau of Investigation took over the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday. This case has placed significant scrutiny on the Mamata Banerjee-led government after a postgraduate trainee doctor was raped and murdered by a volunteer police worker.The agency promptly completed all necessary formalities within hours of the Calcutta High Court's order instructing the state police to transfer the case documents to the central probe agency.Meanwhile, Federation of resident doctors' association called off its strike after meeting Union minister JP Nadda.The controversy began when the victim's family revealed to the Metro that the hospital initially attempted to downplay the incident. The opposition criticised the Mamata government for forming an 11-member panel, which included interns, to investigate the case.Although Sanjay Ray was arrested with evidence and DNA tests linking him to the crime scene, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the West Bengal police of mishandling the investigationInvestigative details indicate that after committing the crime, Sanjay Ray returned to police barracks to sleep. Allegedly, Ray had unrestricted access to various rooms and wards in the hospital.The incident occurred after the victim and four colleagues shared a meal in the seminar room while watching the Olympics. Her colleagues left, and she remained in the room to study. At 3am, she was last seen asleep. Around 4am, the accused allegedly entered, sexually assaulted her, and strangled her when she resisted. Her body was discovered at 7.30am.Sanjay Ray, a civic volunteer with the Kolkata Police , was arrested on Saturday just six hours after a seven-member Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) was formed by the police force to investigate the case.On Sunday, the most damning evidence against Sanjay Ray, the primary suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor, was uncovered by investigators.""Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Ray's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack,"" a senior police officer stated. This evidence strongly links Ray to the heinous crime.The report concluded that the cause of death was smothering and throttling. The initial findings suggest that the victim died as a result of gagging, and there were numerous indications of injuries and struggle on the body. ""The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming.""Sanjay strangled the victim's throat to suffocate them, resulting in the fracture of the thyroid cartilage. The victim's face and eyes were stained with blood, and scratch marks were present on various parts of the body. Additionally, there was evidence of bleeding from the private parts, further indicating the violent nature of the attack.The Calcutta high court has directed Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, to submit a leave application by Tuesday at 3pm. Ghosh's appointment as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, which came immediately after his resignation, sparked protests.""How can the principal - who resigned by taking moral responsibility, be appointed as the principal of another government college? The court has asked him to submit a leave application by 3pm today or the court will pass an order for him to leave the position,"" the court observed.""Why are you protecting him? Record his statement. Let him tell whatever he knows,"" the court asked.The National Human Rights Commission on Tuesday took suo moto cognisance of the case. The commission observed that the contents of the media report, if true, raise a serious issue of violation of human rights of the victim. In response to the gravity of the situation, the commission has issued formal notices to the chief secretary and the director general of Police of West Bengal, requesting a comprehensive report on the incident within a period of two weeks.Representatives from the National Commission for Women went to the location where the crime occurred and spoke with the investigators and the victim's family members. The NCW strongly condemned the incident, describing it as ""heinous,"" and demanded that justice be served.In its direction to transfer the case to the CBI the Calcutta high court also urged the agitating doctors to call off their strike saying that they have a ""pious obligation"".Demonstrations broke out in various parts of India, with medical professionals calling for a thorough inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into recent incidents. Doctors at AIIMS Delhi, as well as hospitals in Mumbai and Nagpur, participated in the protests, urging authorities to take action and ensure better security measures for healthcare workers.The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association has resolved to continue its current indefinite strike after a fruitless discussion with officials from the Union health ministry in New Delhi.Union health minister JP Nadda met with the national president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr R V Asokan.This came after the IMA expressed their shock and dismay in a letter addressed to Nadda, and put forth five demands:The IMA urged the government to declare hospitals as safe zones and define the entitlement of this term in the law. They also called for the establishment of police camps and adequate security personnel in all major government hospitals, with similar arrangements being made mandatory in large private hospitals. The association emphasized the need for compulsory installation of CCTV cameras at vulnerable points within healthcare facilities.The Central Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation into the incident. The agency promptly completed all necessary formalities within hours of the Calcutta High Court's order instructing the state police to transfer the case documents to the central probe agency.On Wednesday early morning, a team of CBI officials from Delhi, accompanied by forensic scientists and medical experts, will visit Kolkata.The federation of resident doctors association (Forda) also met Union health minister JP Nadda and called off the protests after getting assurance of free and fair trail of the matter.",The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the RG Kar Medical College rape- murder case.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Tuesday regretted the ""Pawar versus Pawar"" electoral battle in Baramati in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Baramati Lok Sabha seat, which has been a bastion of Sharad Pawar for decades, saw an interesting contest between senior Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule and his estranged nephew's wife Sunetra Pawar .For Sharad Pawar, who had lost his party and most of his MLAs to Ajit Pawar, it was not just a prestige battle but also a test of his influence and relevance in state politics.Sharad Pawar won this battle hands down with Supriya Sule securing 51.85% of votes and Sunetra Pawar managing only 40.64%. In fact, Sharad Pawar trumped his estranged nephew comprehensively winning 8 Lok Sabha seats, his best-ever performance in Maharashtra. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, could manage only one seat despite being a part of the BJP-led ruling alliance in the state.Reflecting on the Lok Sabha battle, Ajit Pawar said one should not allow politics to enter home. ""I love all my sisters. One shouldn't allow politics to enter homes. I made a mistake in fielding Sunetra against my sister. This shouldn't have happened. But the parliamentary board (of NCP) made a decision. Now I feel it was wrong,"" Ajit Pawar told Marathi news channel Jai Maharashtra.Ajit Pawar, who had split the NCP in July last year and eventually got the name and symbol of the party, has been pushed to a corner after a disastrous showing in Lok Sabha elections. The NCP still does not have a minister in Modi 3.0. This after the party refused to accept minister of state with independent charge post that was being offered for its leader Praful Patel. Ajit Pawar had then said it was a conscious decision taken unanimously as Praful Patel had been a Cabinet minister at the Centre earlier and the offered post would be demotion for him.What's worse for the junior Pawar, the RSS had openly questioned the BJP's alliance with him after the Lok Sabha results were out.An article in ""Organiser"" magazine, which is linked to the RSS, had slammed BJP's move and called it ""unnecessary politicking."" It had said the induction of Ajit Pawar's NCP into NDA had reduced the brand value of BJP.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" RSS lifelong member Ratan Sharda had said in the article.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he had added.However, despite RSS criticism, Ajit Pawar remains a part of the ruling coalition for now. But as Maharashtra gears up for the year-end assembly elections, the NCP leader stares at an uncertain future. Little wonder, the junior Pawar, who was very aggressive vis-à-vis Sharad Pawar before the Lok Sabha elections, seems to have softened his stance. However, Sharad Pawar has made it clear that he can accept Ajit Pawar back only after consulting all leaders who stood with him after his nephew's rebellion.","Sharad Pawar trumped his estranged nephew comprehensively winning 8 Lok Sabha seats.

"Bail rule, jail exception even in special law like UAPA: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bail-rule-jail-exception-even-in-special-law-like-uapa-supreme-court/articleshow/112504869.cms,"Times View It is an established judicial view that bail should be the norm and jail the exception. By clarifying that this principle applies not just in cases of routine crime but even where the charges are under special laws like UAPA, the apex court has made an important ruling.

NEW DELHI: In an important ruling, Supreme Court Tuesday held that the conventional idea ‘ bail is the rule , jail is an exception ’ should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also to others for which special statutes like Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have been enacted if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.While granting bail to a former constable of Bihar Police who was charged under the stringent UAPA because of his alleged association with the outlawed Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI), a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih emphasised that courts should not hesitate in granting bail in serious offences if a case is made out for bail.Recently, the apex court, through its various verdicts, had diluted stringent provisions for bail under special laws, like it did in the Manish Sisodia case when it held that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for bail despite the tough triple test in the anti-laundering act PMLA.Interestingly, just six months ago on Feb 9, another SC bench had held that ‘bail is the rule, jail is an exception’ was not applicable when an accused was facing charges under anti-terror law UAPA and, also, held that delayed trial proceedings in grave offences could not be a ground to seek bail.In the case on Tuesday, the court noted that the accused had been in custody for more than two years and the trial had not commenced. It said the trial court and Patna high court erred in rejecting his bail plea as they did not objectively analyse the evidence and their main focus was on the activities of PFI which the accused was alleged to be associated with.“When a case is made out for grant of bail, courts should not have any hesitation in granting bail. The allegations of the prosecution may be very serious. But the duty of courts is to consider the case for grant of bail in accordance with the law. ‘Bail is the rule and jail is an exception’ is a settled law. Even in a case like the present case where there are stringent conditions for the grant of bail in the relevant statutes, the same rule holds good with the only modification that bail can be granted if the conditions in the statute are satisfied. The rule also means that once a case is made out for grant of bail, the court cannot decline to grant bail. If courts start denying bail in deserving cases, it will be a violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 of our Constitution,” the bench said.On Feb 9, the court had ruled to the contrary. “The conventional idea in bail jurisprudence vis-a-vis ordinary penal offences that the discretion of courts must tilt in favour of the oft-quoted phrase ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’, unless circumstances justify otherwise, does not find any place while dealing with bail applications under UAPA. The ‘exercise’ of the general power to grant bail under UAPA is severely restrictive in scope. The form of the words used in proviso to Section 43D (5) — ‘shall not be released’ — in contrast with the form of the words as found in Section 437(1) CrPC — ‘may be released’ — suggests the intention of the legislature to make bail the exception and jail the rule,” the court had said.In the Patna case, the prosecution alleged that the accused was associated with PFI and he let out one floor of his house to members of the outfit to carry out illegal activities. It was also alleged that he was part of the meeting where PFI members discussed plans to kill BJP’s Nupur Sharma for her statements on Prophet Mohammed. But the court said the evidence and statements of witnesses falsified the allegation that he was present in the meeting.The court said there was nothing in the chargesheet which showed that the accused had taken part or had committed unlawful activities as defined in UAPA and no specific material was there to show that he advocated, abetted or incited commission of any unlawful activities.Analysing the evidence and statements of witnesses threadbare, the bench said on plain reading of the chargesheet, it was not possible to record a conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the charges against the accused of commission of offences punishable under UAPA were prima facie true.“There is not even an allegation in the chargesheet that the appellant was a member of any terrorist gang. As regards the second part of being a member of a terrorist organisation, as per Section 2(m), a terrorist organisation means an organisation listed in the first schedule or an organisation operating under the same name as the organisation was listed. The chargesheet does not mention the name of the terrorist organisation within the meaning of Section 2(m) of which the appellant was a member.

PFI and its affiliates were termed “unlawful association” under UAPA and banned by govt in Sept 2022. The first schedule of UAPA lists terrorist organisations.","It is an established judicial view that bail should be the norm and jail the exception.

EC to talk to home secretary on Jammu & Kashmir security today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-to-talk-to-home-secretary-on-jammu-kashmir-security-today/articleshow/112504795.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission will hold consultations with the Union home secretary Wednesday to assess the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of scheduling assembly polls in the Union Territory, besides discussing the possible challenges and concerns as well as availability of security forces .Some key concerns likely to come up during the deliberations between EC — represented by CEC Rajiv Kumar and election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu — and Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla include arranging the force logistics to secure the candidates, campaign meetings and electors, particularly as the recent uptick in terrorist activities in Jammu region has led to redeployment of forces to secure the mountain tops and counter the foreign terrorists hiding there.Even Kashmir districts like Kulgam and Anantnag have seen attacks on security personnel of late, and counter-terror operations are underway to trace and neutralise the perpetrators.EC sources toldthat the requirement of security forces for poll deployment is assessed as “very high” as their stepped-up presence is crucial to creating a conducive security atmosphere for campaigning and polling. More than 16,000 personnel will be needed to extend security to an average 15 candidates in each of J&K’s 90 assembly constituencies.“Democracy is to be strengthened layer by layer... increasing voting percentage is just one layer, the others being facilitating participation by a large number of candidates, more poll rallies and meetings and the wider use of IT applications like CVigil etc. EC is committed to holding the polls in J&K with all the layers strengthened,” CEC Rajiv Kumar toldSome other factors to be considered by EC are climatic conditions in J&K, apple harvesting season, and expected seasonal migration of nomadic tribes like Gujjars and Bakarwals from the higher reaches to lower ground, over Sept and Oct.The EC had indicated its intent to hold J&K polls within the Sept 30 deadline set by the Supreme Court by announcing the special summary revision of electoral rolls in J&K and other poll-bound states in June. An EC team visited J&K last week to assess poll preparedness and has now set up the customary meeting with MHA to discuss the security arrangements.A source said the publication of revised J&K electoral roll with July 1, 2024 as reference date, on Aug 20 and the conclusion of Amarnath Yatra on Aug 19, shall pave the way for EC to announce polls any day after Aug 20.Sources in the J&K security establishment said that while there are concerns about the surge in terror strikes in Jammu, “the fact remains that most of these attacks were the handiwork of foreign terrorists and targeted at security forces”. “The threat to J&K elections may, on the other hand, emanate from local terrorists and sleeper modules and target candidates and other civilians. J&K Police have largely controlled the situation in the flat areas of Kashmir and even Jammu, though the hilly regions remain a challenge. Terrorists may still carry out surprise attacks, but J&K Police are fully prepared for conduct of assembly polls as and when the EC directs,” a senior police officer told","The Election Commission will hold consultations with the Union home secretary Wednesday to assess the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

Murder: Bilaspur court sentences man to death for murdering wife and three minor children in 'rarest of rare' case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilaspur-court-sentences-man-to-death-for-murdering-wife-and-three-minor-children-in-rarest-of-rare-case/articleshow/112503893.cms,"RAIPUR: The trial court of Bilaspur has convicted 34-year-old Umend Kevat for the murder of his wife and three minor children , including his 18-month-old son Pawan Kevat, under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code , and has pronounced the death penalty for the accused, considering the case as one of the rarest of the rare. Suspecting his wife's character, the accused strangled Sukrita Kevat, 32, along with their daughters Khushi Kevat, 5, Lisa Kevat, 3, and son Pawan Kevat on January 1, 2024.“Given the severity of the crime, the accused's behavior does not warrant any leniency.The act of murdering his helpless wife and children in such a brutal manner makes this case one of the ' rarest of rare ' cases, which justifies the imposition of the death penalty,” the trial court stated.The tenth Additional Sessions Judge, Bilaspur, Avinash K Tripathi, said, “The court is of the view that a witness may lie, but circumstances do not. Circumstantial evidence forms the basis of rules and law. The accused, in this case, is solely responsible for the crime from which he cannot escape. The saying 'Actions Speak Louder Than Words' applies aptly to this case. The only conclusion is that no one else has committed the crime other than the accused, Umend Kevat.”Citing Supreme Court judgments in similar cases and the circumstances of this case, the court ruled that the accused's act of killing his family was nothing less than inhumane. The victims, including the children, were innocent and helpless. After a premeditated plan, the accused killed his wife and children one by one by strangling them with a rope, likely driven by doubts about his wife’s character.The accused first took his wife outside under the pretext of some work, strangled her from behind with a rope, and then returned to the room to kill his three children. This indicates that the accused was fully aware of his actions and their consequences. The manner in which these murders were carried out reflects a calculated and deliberate plan, leaving no room for doubt that this was an exceptionally heinous crime, the trial court noted.After thoroughly examining all the circumstances and arguments presented, the court rejected the plea for leniency and sentenced the accused to death under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, along with a fine of Rs 10,000. The court also ordered that the accused be hanged by the neck until death. This death sentence will remain subject to confirmation by the High Court as per Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The trial court also observed that the impact of these murders is especially devastating for the surviving family members, particularly the elderly grandparents, whose only surviving relatives have now been taken from them. Given these circumstances, the court found no reason to show any leniency, concluding that Umend Kevat’s actions warrant the death penalty, which is in the best interest of society.","Umend Kevat, 34, convicted of murdering his wife and three minor children, including his 18-month-old son Pawan Kevat.

Chhattisgarh leads India's charge with first Lithium mine in Korba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chhattisgarh-leads-indias-charge-with-first-lithium-mine-in-korba/articleshow/112501456.cms,"RAIPUR: India is set to open its first lithium mines in the Katghora region of Korba district of Chhattisgarh following confirmation of significant lithium deposits by the Geological Survey of India (GSI).The decision to open the lithium mines was announced during the sixth governing body meeting of the National Mineral Exploration Trust in New Delhi on Monday.The GSI reported lithium concentrations of 10 to 2,000 parts per million (PPM) across approximately 250 hectares, with potential for even higher content.The meeting of the National Mineral Exploration Trust was chaired by Union Minister G Kishan Reddy and discussions were done on how the extraction and utilization of minerals can be done along with conservation of nature and the environment.State health minister Shyam Bihari Jaiswal attended the meeting as a representative of Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai, stating that lithium is currently a crucial metal that will lead the state and country towards new dimensions of development.The minister said, “With the commencement of the lithium mine in the state, Chhattisgarh will become one of the leading states in the country to contribute much more to the vision of developed India by 2047.”Ministry of Mines had issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) on the MSTC portal for the allocation of 20 critical and strategic mineral blocks, including those in Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Chhattisgarh through e-auction.According to information shared by officials in the state mining department, among these 20 blocks, the lithium and Rare Earth Element (REE) block in Katghora area was included. Preliminary surveys by GSI have found lithium content ranging from 10 PPM to 2,000 PPM in an area of approximately 250 hectares. The block also contains rare earth elements.Critical and strategic minerals are required for renewable energy, defence, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, high-tech electronics, telecommunications, and transportation and currently, the country relies on imports for these minerals.Lithium was among the 23 proposals by state for exploration projects and is considered as a critical mineral used in making lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, the demand of which has grown exponentially.Chhattisgarh has generated approximately Rs 13,000 crore in mineral revenue in 2023-24, which is nearly 30 times more than the year of state formation.","The decision to open the lithium mines was announced during the sixth governing body meeting of the National Mineral Exploration Trust in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Government is unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report as senior officials believe that the charges against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, are ""untrue and malicious"" and are in response to the regulator 's notice to the short seller.They alleged that Hindenburg may also be trying to make a quick buck from the Indian markets through its latest action and the regulator and govt are keeping a close tab on how the developments unfold.Describing it as a fresh attempt to ""create a smokescreen"", a govt source suggested that this may be part of a larger attempt to discredit the regulator at a time when the Indian stock market is seeing a good run on the back of healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and strong growth prospects with clean corporate and bank balance sheets. The source alleged such actions were part of a pattern to hit Indian markets but argued that the markets were now strong and deep enough to withstand Hindenburg-type attacks.""There have been a series of regulatory actions to improve the overall functioning of the markets and the regulator itself has not shied away from cautioning investors, wherever it sees pressure building up,"" another official said, while listing out a host of measures taken by Sebi. The officer said that Sebi has submitted its probe findings on issues raised by Hindenburg in its earlier report to the Supreme Court.Pointing to the statements issued by Madhabi Puri Buch and Dhaval Buch , who both worked in the private sector, officials said required disclosures had been made, which may not be in public domain like those of civil servants.While suggesting that some of Puri Buch's actions may have upset some of the market participants, sources said, the regulator has followed an elaborate consultation paper, even in the case of REITs, amid suggestions by Hindenburg that the rules benefited Blackstone, where Dhaval is an adviser.Market players are closely monitoring govt's response, given that Puri Buch has over six months to go as Sebi chief and is eligible for another term. She took over as Sebi chief in March 2022 and was given a three-year term.","Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch are accused of irregularities.
