Why Jharkhand may hold key to national tribal politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-jharkhand-may-hold-key-to-national-tribal-politics/articleshow/110516194.cms,"RANCHI: Jharkhand accounts for 2.42 per cent of the country’s total geographical area and 2.77 per cent of the total population. Yet in terms of representation, it has 14 seats — 2.5 per cent share — in the 543-member Lok Sabha .Why is such a state relevant in national politics ? Primarily because of the tribal population as the state accounts for five of the 47 seats reserved for scheduled tribes nationally. For BJP , Congress and even the regional parties that fought for a separate tribal state since pre-independent times, these seats matter.Since its formation, Jharkhand has seen BJP-led alliance govts none of which could complete a full term. Political instability hindered the state’s development, despite its rich mineral resources.But the saffron party has improved its performance in the Lok Sabha polls. From one seat in 2004, BJP made it 12 out of 14 in 2014 and maintained the tally in 2019 by taking Ajsu party alongside. The opposition had a different story to tell. CPI and RJD were wiped off the scene in 2009 while Congress had to settle for one seat. In 2014, Congress drew a blank, but it re-emerged in 2019 with one seat. JMM, however, gave the saffron party a fight in all these elections by retaining at least one seat.The LS polls this year will also set the stage for the assembly elections to be held later this year.Jharkhand’s tribal population, primarily consisting of Ho, Munda, Santhal, and Oraon communities, comprises 26.21 per cent of the state’s 3.2 crore population as per the 2011 census. The number is expected to be higher in the upcoming census.The current non-BJP govt in the state, the JMM-Congress-RJD combine, has been at odds with the central govt since it came to power in 2019, primarily over funds. The state govt alleges it is being destabilised using central agencies.The arrest of former tribal chief minister Hemant Soren by ED for alleged land grab earlier this year is being portrayed as a fight for ‘tribal Asmita’ (pride) and ‘abuse of constitutional bodies’.BJP, which was criticised for choosing non-tribal Raghubar Das as CM in 2014, lost the next assembly elections. Soon after, the state’s first CM, Babulal Marandi, was brought back to lead the party in Jharkhand. BJP has manoeuvred carefully in the state to demonstrate its ‘love for tribes’ but it has been challenged by local parties as well.“Tribals in Jharkhand have long been demanding the implementation of the Sarna code, which would give them a separate religious identity. They have also been demanding the inclusion of their languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. With state govt backing it vehemently, tribal voters could swing in its favour in these polls,” remarked a political science professor at Ranchi University.He said the ongoing polls may also throw a referendum indirectly on JMM patriarch Shibu Soren’s successor Hemant, to decide the future course of him and his party.“With the incarcerated Hemant still being the face of the state’s coalition govt and INDIA bloc in the state, the LS poll outcome will also be a referendum on whether tribal voters consider him as a culprit or victim of political vendetta. It is because in the last four years, he emerged as the most vocal tribal voice nationally to stand against BJP and Modi regime,” he added.Main opposition BJP, on the other hand, has been trying to attract tribal voters by showcasing the development work done by the central government.However, a slew of unsuccessful attempts to amend CNT and SPT Acts between 2014 and 2019 and the introduction of the contentious anti-conversion bill during Das’s tenure has contributed to a perception — which still persists — that BJP is an ‘anti-tribal’ party.","Jharkhand accounts for 2.42 per cent of the country’s total geographical area.

Karnataka town tense as group assaults tailor after altercation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-town-tense-as-group-assaults-tailor-after-altercation/articleshow/110516173.cms,"Representative image

MANDYA: Belluru town in Karnataka's Mandya district was on edge on Monday night after a group allegedly from the minority community attacked and wounded a 28-year-old tailor named Abhilash , following a confrontation when a car hit his motorbike on Saturday evening.

According to sources, the group accosted and assaulted Abhilash when he was returning from his shop on Monday evening, and later entered nearby colonies and abused the residents there. Abhilash was admitted to a private hospital, and residents rushed to Belluru police station to lodge a complaint.

However, the complainants alleged that police delayed filing an FIR. This led to protests outside the police station. ""Based on a complaint lodged by Abhilash's father, we have registered an FIR under IPC section 307,"" Mandya SP N Yatish said Tuesday. No arrests have been made so far.

Police said the accused group have also lodged a counter complaint. Southern Range DIG Amit Singh visited the town and reviewed the situation Tuesday morning, while senior BJP and JD(S) functionaries went to the hospital to enquire about Abhilash.

FEROZEPUR : “Shaheedan di dharti de soormeyan da khoon hun chitta pe gaya ey. Pakistan di himmat nai, saade apne hi gaddar jimmevar ne es nasalkushi layi (Bravehearts in land of martyrs now have white blood. Pakistan doesn’t dare, our own traitors are responsible for this ‘genocide’).”This is how Ajit Singh (84), who valiantly donned the olive greens during the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars and retired from the Army as a havaldar, sums up the sorry state of affairs in Punjab’s border district Ferozepur, which is tightly in the grip of ‘chitta’ ( heroin ), being pumped in from Pakistan through the international border.Ask anyone in this border belt about the burning issues in the Lok Sabha elections and pat comes the response, generally in this order — drugs , unemployment, lack of industries, theft, snatchings and extortions.And, all these issues are interrelated. People also demand reopening of the Hussainiwala international border for trade since it has been lying closed after the 1971 Indo-Pak war. It is in Hussainiwala that the last rites of revolutionary martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were performed in March 1931 on the banks of Sutlej river.A native of Baba Ram Lal Nagar, where at least 200 houses out of nearly 300 have one or more members settled abroad, the Army veteran says, “Chitte ne jinda murde banate saade jawan munde ithe. Saanu shauk nahi karza le ke bachcheyan nu baahar bhejan da (Heroin has turned our young boys into living corpses here. We are not pleased to send our children abroad by taking loans).”A long queue of addicts outside the outpatient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centre at Ferozepur’s district hospital from 8am to 2pm daily depicts the enormity of the situation. They come here to get their free dose of buprenorphine and naloxone combination sublingual tablets in a bid to get out of the clutches of substance abuse.Since its start in 2018, this OOAT centre has had 3,346 drug-dependent patients, including seven women, in the 17-86 age bracket.There are over 20 OOAT centres across Ferozepur district. Centres with the maximum registration of heroin addicts include Makhu, Guru Har Sahai and Mamdot.“We are registering on average 10-15 new patients every month. Female patients are generally those who have either their husbands hooked to heroin or have distorted relationships or are into prostitution,” says Dr Navdeep Soi, a psychiatrist at the hospital.She says the patients have to come to the OOAT centre daily for medicines and only after a month are they given pills for 14 days in one visit. “There are patients who sell their medicines for money,” she says.A 28-year-old injectable heroin-dependent truck driver registered here in 2019 accepts that like many drivers he does sometimes get “bhukki” (poppy husk) from Phalodi in Rajasthan. “A single dose of heroin called ‘bit’ by users is now available for nearly Rs 800-1,000,” he claims.A 73-year-old opium-dependent patient in the queue says that bike thefts by unemployed drug addicts in Ferozepur are common, even on the district hospital campus.“It is very difficult to get out of drug addiction. Unfortunately, many parents have lost young boys to heroin overdose in many areas, including the infamous Basti Shekhan Wali,” he rues.There’s a strong local network of drug distributors. Parkash Singh (47) of Gatti Mattar village under Mamdot block says that nearly 10 days back, police had arrested a youngster, Charanjeet Channi, of his village with a big haul of heroin.Ajit’s three grandchildren have already flown to Winnipeg in Canada and one to Adelaide in Australia in the last few years, just like many of his neighbours in Baba Ram Lal Nagar. Singh says all the three grandsons work as truck drivers, earning between Rs 3-3.5 lakh per month.The granddaughter was sent to Winnipeg on study visa to pursue a sixmonth MSc nursing course, for which the family spent Rs 22 lakh. They took an education loan of Rs 15 lakh from UCO Bank at nearly 11% interest rate and the remaining amount as a property loan at almost similar rates.The granddaughter also works in a departmental store in Winnipeg, earning $16 per hour and working for 20 hours in a week.Ferozepur has one of the oldest Army cantonments in the country, established by the British in 1839. Since this cantonment also has an Army recruitment office, it has served as one of the major employers for the youth in the region.But the launch of the Agnipath Scheme in June 2022, under which youths aged 17.5 to 21 years are recruited as Agniveers for a period of four years without any pensionary benefits, has come as a major setback.“This will definitely dent BJP’s vote bank. We are a martial race and the govt is forcing our youth towards unemployment, drugs and crime,” says Anokh Singh, a retired subedar from Aliwala village in Ferozepur, pointing to the rising number of gangsters in the region, who even call the shots from inside jails.Ferozepur Lok Sabha constituency has been a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) stronghold since 1998.But this time it is not an easy game because of a multi-cornered contest.Since sitting MP and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has refrained from contesting, the party has fielded former MP Zora Singh Mann’s son Nardev Singh, alias Bobby Mann.Former MP from SAD Sher Singh Ghubaya, representing the strong Rai Sikh community here, is contesting on a Congress ticket while Muktsar MLA Jagdep Singh Kaka Brar has been fielded by Aam Aadmi Party. Former cabinet minister in the state Congress govt, Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, is the BJP nominee.","Punjab’s border district Ferozepur is tightly in the grip of ‘chitta’ ( heroin ), being pumped in from Pakistan through the international border.

Legacy

GHOSI (MAU): Even 25 years after his death, no candidate addresses the people of Ghosi Lok Sabha constituency during the ongoing campaign without remembering Kalpnath Rai — a politician who continues to be synonymous with Mau.“A four-time member of Lok Sabha and thrice of Rajya Sabha, Rai carried out development works in and around the district which continue to serve as benchmark. No other parliamentarian from Mau has been able to match the standard till now, let alone surpassing it,” says Virendra Kumar aka Virendra Engineer, once an associate of Rai.“In contrast to Rai’s contribution, barely two months after the death of five-term MLA from Mau Sadar and mafia don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, no sympathy wave is palpable in the constituency in general, and Mau Sadar assembly seat in particular. Behind Ansari’s success were an atmosphere of fear, backing from a particular community and the interests of a handful of people who got contracts,” says advocate Hari Kant Singh.“It is hard to forget Kalpnath Rai’s name when the development of Mau is discussed. It is equally hard to pin-point development works undertaken during Ansari’s five terms, barring construction of roads, drains and setting up of transformers at some places in the constituency,” a govt official, listening to the conversation, chips in.Discussing the projects completed in Rai’s tenure, Virendra Engineer reels out the numbers: “Around 23 power sub-stations, 28 automatic telephone exchanges, and one of the first three 400 kVA power substations in the region were set up in Mau. The other two came up in Varanasi and Gorakhpur.” He points towards an 18-acre rose park across the MauBallia Road, adding that this is one of the last works done by ‘Rai Saheb’ before he died on June 4, 1999, at age 58.“Rai also got a new DM residence built on a five-acre land, a new collectorate and court and over half-a-dozen modern guest houses. The Indian Institute of Seed Science and National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms also came in Mau during his time,” Virendra says, adding that several politicians who came after Rai’s demise claimed they would take Mau to newer heights but none could.“Mau had three railway overbridges at a time when even the state capital didn’t have one,” says Avinish Rai, from Kopa in Mau district. “Rai’s vision of development was such that Mau Sadar, which was not even a tehsil until 1987, became a district in 1988,” he adds.“Politicians have been challenged by people to just get the infrastructure and buildings that Rai got constructed whitewashed and maintained during their fiveyear term. This itself will be a great service to the people of Mau. But even that hasn’t been done,” says Virendra.Shravan Kumar, another Rai admirer, says: “There are many people who have the vision but very few have a strong passion to work for their constituency.”Ironically, candidates across party lines continue to try and show themselves as the “true heir” of Rai’s legacy. After the MP’s death in 1999, his second wife Sudha Rai and his son Siddharth contested against each other in the LS polls. But both lost. Sudha was fielded by Congress while Siddharth was a nominee of George Fernandes-led Samata Party, then part of NDA.“While every second person in Mau talks about Rai’s achievements, his home in Semari Jamalpur wears a deserted look,” says Narendra Rai from Kalpnath’s village. “Not sure who all live there nowadays,” he adds.Balkrishna Chauhan, who won the 1999 LS elections on a BSP ticket is once again the party candidate. He is pitted against SP-Congress alliance candidate Rajeev Rai and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP)-BJP alliance candidate Arvind Rajbhar. Arvind is the son of SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who is a cabinet minister in the Yogi government.INDIA bloc’s Rajeev promises to develop Mau as Rai had done while Rajbhar and Chauhan say that they will fulfil “Rai’s dreams” of bringing unprecedented development to Ghosi.BSP has won the seat thrice — Chauhan in 1999, Dara Singh Chauhan, now a state minister, in 2009, and sitting MP Atul Rai in 2019. SP’s Chandradeo Prasad Rajbhar won the election in 2004 and BJP’s Hari Narayan Rajbhar bagged the seat in 2014.Rai had won the Ghosi seat in 1989, 1991, 1996 and 1998. “Despite his achievements, even Rai had to sweat it out in Mau when it came to winning elections,” says Virendra, adding that the caste equations, which ruled then, dominate even to this day in this constituency.","Rai was a four-time member of Lok Sabha and thrice of Rajya Sabha.

After coaching Mumbai, Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh to Ranji titles, what does an IPL crown mean to you?

What do you think makes you such a successful coach?

Recently, a few players had criticised your coaching approach...

How would you describe mentor Gautam Gambhir’s role in the win?

KKR captain Shreyas Iyer has been very impressive, leading from the front despite losing his BCCI contract...

How did you motivate Shreyas?

Mitchell Starc was struggling initially...

Assistant coach Abhishek Nayar too came in for a lot of praise...

MUMBAI: When this IPL began, Kolkata Knight Riders ' ( KKR ) coach Chandrakant Pandit wasn’t going through a pleasant time, with a few players questioning his “dictatorial” coaching style. Pandit had the last laugh on Sunday. In an exclusive interview with TOI, Pandit explained what makes him a successful coach.It’s a great, special and a very different feeling.This is a high-pressure, prestigious international-level tournament. There’s continuous travelling and you have to maintain that winning momentum. There are a lot of ups and downs. It’s a long journey. You face many obstacles, and to bounce back from them feels something different for the team.I always believe in discipline. There’s a routine that I always follow. Respecting the game is most important. I don’t go above the game, and never allow the others to do that.I always stick to my style of working. I don’t get distracted or react to that because you cannot keep everyone happy. I’ve been coaching for almost 25 years now; however, I’m also changing a little with the new generation and understanding them better. This season was more relaxed because I knew what was important for the team.His presence in the dugout was a great motivation for everyone. It was a great boost for us. He came in with a lot of cricketing experience. He’s been a part of the IPL for so many years. We took all the decisions collectively.I would give a lot of credit to Shreyas. He’s been a fantastic captain, very calm and cool. He was receptive to our suggestions and handled the team well on and off the field. With KKR, he showed the qualities which make him worthy for India captaincy in the future.Any player will be a little disappointed with that (BCCI contract snub). However, that should not affect his performance. Whenever we would discuss anything, we would never touch upon that point. We were clear that the task at hand was more important. I remember that he told me: ‘Sir, I’ll prove it.’ The way he has batted in this IPL, he now seems to be a more matured, sensible batsman.It’s about the plan that we are expecting him to execute. He’s such a big, experienced player. I could make out that he’s highly committed. We discussed about trying to come round the wicket at times. He accepted our suggestion and tried it out too in a match. He’s a very humble man. He was always there to discuss anything with us and was very receptive.Nayar’s contribution was huge, while Bharat Arun (bowling coach) and Carl Crowe (spin-bowling coach) deserve credit for the bowlers’ fine show. Nayar conducts our camps well. He spends time throughout the year with our domestic players. Whenever they are free, our domestic players come to Mumbai for a camp with us. It’s not necessary that 15 players have to be there for us to have a camp.",Chandrakant Pandit has won the IPL with Kolkata Knight Riders. The KKR coach has been criticised for his 'dictatorial' coaching style. Pandit says he is changing with the new generation and understanding them better. He also praises mentor Gautam Gambhir for his support.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110483084,imgsize-67688,width-400,resizemode-4/110483084.jpg"

Pune Porsche crash: 2 doctors arrested for changing blood sample of accused teen sent to police custody till May 30,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-porsche-crash-2-doctors-arrested-for-changing-blood-sample-of-accused-teen/articleshow/110450307.cms,"Govt forms three-member panel after arrest of two doctors of Sassoon Hospital

PUNE: Two doctors from Sassoon general hospital , arrested on Monday for destruction of evidence against the minor accused in Pune Porsche crash that killed two techies, were sent to police custody till May 30 by court.According to the police, the blood samples of the underage driver were discarded in a dustbin and substituted with samples from another individual, which showed no evidence of alcohol consumption. The arrested individuals have been identified as Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware. The court has remanded them in police custody until May 30.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI, ""We have arrested Taware and Halnor for changing the blood samples and manipulating the blood sample reports. We studied the entire procedure at the hospital and realised the manipulation. Our team then decided to arrest the two doctors"".“The minor’s first blood sample was collected at around 11 am on May 19 at Sassoon hospital (eight-and-a-half hours after the accident) and the second was collected at the Aundh-based hospital around 7pm, to rule out the possibility of any manipulation like replacement of blood samples. Both these samples were sent for DNA fingerprinting to FSL. The blood sample which was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin of the hospital and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab. During the investigation, we found Srihari Halnor replaced this on the instructions of the HOD Forensic Medicine Department of Sassoon, Ajay Tawre. The DNA fingerprinting of the minor’s father was done at FSL after his arrest last Tuesday in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” he said.The senior police official further said that as an abundant precaution, they had taken one more sample of the juvenile for DNA sampling and it was sent to another hospital.""The report of the other hospital revealed the juvenile's blood report at the Sassoon Hospital was manipulated as the DNA of (blood samples of) both the reports did not match,"" he said.Both the doctors did not have any idea that the police would take one more sample (of the accused juvenile), he said.""A probe is underway on whose blood samples were collected to replace with that of the juvenile's. We have recovered CCTV footages of the Sassoon Hospital and further probe is on,"" Kumar said.He also said that Indian Penal sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections have been added to the case in which the juvenile has been booked.""We have made the juvenile's father co-accused in the present case,"" he said.""The juvenile's father had called the doctor and offered him allurements to replace the blood samples,"" Commissioner Amitesh Kumar added.According to Pune CP, the builder hired a middleman to get in touch with the mortuary staffer and the latter then facilitated the builder’s contact with forensic sciences department head Dr Ajay Taware around 10am on May 19.The accident, which occurred in the early morning of May 19, resulted in the deaths of two IT professionals when their motorcycle was struck by a speeding Porsche Taycan car at Kalyaninagar at 2.30 am, allegedly driven by the minor.The police have also obtained CCTV footage from one of the pubs visited by the boy, where he reportedly paid a bill amounting to Rs 48,000.The minor accused, who was taken to Sasoon Hospital for a medical examination, had his blood sample allegedly switched with another sample during the course of the investigation.According to the police, the teenager was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. It was later discovered that the minor's blood report was swapped with that of another individual who had not consumed alcohol.As the police awaited the blood sample reports, the manipulation came to light. To prevent any further tampering, the police had collected two samples from the boy. According to the Pune police commissioner, second blood sample indicated alcohol consumption by the teen accused.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to the teenager and instructed him to write an essay about road accidents. However, due to public outrage over the lenient treatment and a review application submitted by the police, the teenager was remanded to an observation home until June 5.Earlier, the Crime Branch unit arrested the grandfather of the minor accused on May 25 in connection with the accident. Pune city commissioner said that a separate FIR was filed against the grandfather under IPC sections 365 and 368.The driver, Gangadhar, filed a complaint with the police claiming that he was forcibly taken to the accused grandfather's residence on the night of May 19 while leaving the Yerawada Police Station.The accused grandfather and his father allegedly threatened Gangadhar, snatched his phone and forcibly kept him confined in their bungalow in an attempt to force him to take responsibility for the crime instead of his minor grandson.The Maharashtra government has set up a three-member committee in response to the arrest of two doctors and an employee from Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The order appointing the committee was issued by Medical Education Commissioner Rajiv Nivatkar on Monday, with Dr Pallavi Sapale, dean of Grant Medical College and J J group of hospitals, serving as the chairperson.The committee also includes Dr Gajanan Chavan, a professor in the forensic medicine department at Grant Medical College, and Dr Sudhir Chowdhary, the Special Duty Officer at Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar Government Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital. The committee has been instructed to visit Pune on Tuesday to conduct their investigation.Pune commissioner has also instructed Dr Vinayak Kale, Dean of Sassoon General Hospital, to fully cooperate with the committee during the probe, as stated in the order.","Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware have been arrested. The blood samples of the underage driver were discarded in a dustbin and substituted with samples from another individual, which showed no evidence of alcohol consumption.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110452999,imgsize-944699,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110452999.jpg"
"India, France to begin contract negotiations for 26 Rafale-Marine jets this week",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-france-to-begin-contract-negotiations-for-26-rafale-marine-jets-this-week/articleshow/110507112.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will kick off official contract negotiations with France this week for the mega acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for over Rs 50,000 crore, with the Navy keen on inducting the supersonic jets for its two aircraft carriers as soon as possible due to the expanding Chinese threat in the Indian Ocean Region.A team of officials from the French government, fighter-manufacturer Dassault and weapon systems integrator Thales, among others, is arriving here on May 30 for the talks with the contract negotiation committee (CNC) constituted by the Indian defence ministry.This comes after the MoD and Navy evaluated the bid or letter of acceptance (LoA) submitted by France in December in response to India’s letter of request (LoR) for the acquisition of 22 single-seat jets and four twin-seat trainers, along with weapons, simulator, spares, crew training and logistics support.“It took time to examine the voluminous LoA with its offer, technical specifications, costs and other details. The CNC is headed by an official from the MoD acquisitions wing and includes representatives from the Navy,” an official said.The aim is to conclude the techno-commercial negotiations and ink the government-to-government deal, after the requisite approval by the PM-led cabinet committee on security, within this financial year.The proposed deals for the 26 Rafale-Ms and three additional Scorpene submarines to be built at Mazagon Docks for around Rs 30,000 crore were granted acceptance of necessity by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council on July 13 last year, a day before the subsequent Modi-Macron summit in Paris.The Navy only has 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant. The MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years.With the indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter (TEDBF) likely to take at least a decade to become operational, the Navy had pushed for the 26 Rafale-M jets as an interim measure. The IAF has already inducted 36 Rafales under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016.China is now conducting trials of its third aircraft carrier, the over 80,000-tonne Fujian, after earlier inducting the 60,000-tonne Liaoning and the 66,000-tonne Shandong, and building more such warships.The Indian government, in contrast, is yet to even give the preliminary nod for the long-pending case for a third 45,000-tonne aircraft carrier, let alone a more potent 65,000-tonne one, which will take at least a decade to build.The US has 11 `super’ 90,000-100,000-tonne nuclear-powered carriers, each of which can carry 70-80 fighters and aircraft. Significantly, the Fujian -- like the newest American carrier USS Gerald R Ford -- has an electromagnetic catapult system to also launch much heavier aircraft for surveillance, early-warning and electronic warfare.While the 10 US Nimitz-class carriers have steam-powered catapults, INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant as well as Liaoning and Shandong have only angled ski-jumps that allow fighters to take off under their own power.","India will kick off official contract negotiations with France this week for the mega acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for over Rs 50,000 crore.

What low voter turnout in Lok Sabha polls could mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-2024-awaiting-june-4-what-voter-turnout-across-phases-suggests-bjp-congress-nda-alliance-result-phase-7-amethi-india-bloc/articleshow/110496953.cms,"What does difference in voter turnout suggest

Voter turnout shifts: Insights and political impacts

Amethi: Minor turnout variations, major electoral shifts

NEW DELHI: In the initial phases of Lok Sabha elections 2024, low voter turnout percentage emerged as a concern not just for the Election Commission but also for the political parties including Bharatiya Janata Party and INDI alliance.However, the seats being contested in the 2024 elections are not exactly the same as those in the 2019 elections, but the differences led to a debate over the implications of low voter turnout.In a move questioned by several opposition parties, the Election Commission updated the voter turnout percentage for phase 1 of the Lok Sabha election after 11 days and for phase 2 after 2 days.With phase 1 polls completed on April 19 voter turnout data for phase 1 was released by a delay of 11 days on April 30, followed by phase 2 data on April 28, just two days after the phase 2 elections on April 26.Opposition parties questioned the delayed update of turnout data. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to all parties, urging them to raise their voices against the Election Commission's move.In his ‘open letter’ to INDIA bloc leaders and other opposition leaders, Kharge highlighted the delay in releasing the final voting percentages for the initial phases of the Lok Sabha elections, suggesting that such delays cast doubts on the credibility of the data provided by the poll panel. He questioned the rationale behind the Election Commission's delay in releasing the voter turnout data, which was made public 11 days after the first phase and four days after the second phase. Additionally, he sought clarification from the Commission regarding the reasons for the delay.The Election Commission reacted sharply to Kharge's allegations and accused him of creating impediments in the conduct of free and fair elections. The Commission said it finds a ‘pattern’ in a series of past and present irresponsible statements from Congress. Calling it ‘disconcerting’, the commission added that with all facts in place, the Congress President is attempting to push a biased narrative.Following this, turnout data for subsequent phases was uploaded much faster.Experts interpret the difference in voter turnout in various ways. Some suggest that low voter turnout could disadvantage the Bharatiya Janata Party, while others believe it might harm the Congress more.The BJP, along with other opposition parties and the Congress, both claimed that the low voter turnout would be harmful. The BJP asserted that its voters were turning out at the booths. In fact, top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, passionately urged voters to cast their votes.Some experts suggested that the BJP was heading for a huge win, causing its voters to become complacent. BJP leaders, including PM Modi , made several appeals requesting voters to come out and vote. They claimed that it was the opposition voters who were not showing up because they were sure of their defeat.The change in voter turnout percentage cannot be a definitive metric to judge election outcomes, but it often provides valuable insights. The shifts in voting percentages in key constituencies are always of significant interest. For instance, the Election Commission data shows substantial increases in voter turnout in several important constituencies: Jodhpur saw a 19.04% increase, Gandhinagar experienced a 19.38% rise, and Khunti reported a 17.9% increase. These changes suggest varying levels of voter engagement and potential shifts in political dynamics across these regions.While some experts argue that a huge increase in voter turnout is a symbol for change, however that is not always the case.Smriti Irani , who contested from Amethi against Rahul Gandhi in the 2014 elections, lost despite a significant campaign. The voting turnout percentage did not show much change despite the difference in the result. In 2014, the voter turnout percentage in Amethi was 52.38%, which was in favor of Rahul Gandhi. In 2019, it saw a marginal increase to 54.05%, which resulted in a victory for Smriti Irani. Now, in 2024, Amethi reported a voter turnout of 54.34%. These slight changes in voter turnout percentages reflect the evolving political dynamics in the constituency.Despite these small changes in voter turnout, the constituency has seen varying electoral outcomes, highlighting that turnout percentages alone do not always predict the election results.When examining the data, the difference in voter turnout between 2019 and 2024 is notably marginal. The average voter turnout in 2019 was 66.54%, compared to 65.54% in 2024 – both figures only till phase 6.Many electoral experts have attributed this slight decline to various factors. A significant reason cited is the intense heat wave experienced during the 2024 elections. Additionally, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were scheduled 15 days earlier than the 2019 elections, which may have also contributed to the lower turnout. These factors together have influenced voter participation, reflecting a complex interplay of environmental and logistical elements.The nation eagerly awaits June 4, when the long-anticipated electoral results will be revealed, determining the fate of many candidates.","Low voter turnout in 2024 elections led to a debate over the implications of low voter turnout. Election Commission updated the voter turnout percentage for phase 1 of the Lok Sabha election after 11 days and for phase 2 after 2 days. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to all parties, urging them to raise their voices against the Election Commission's move.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110497467,imgsize-898376,width-400,resizemode-4/110497467.jpg"

Chauhan had been arrested by ED from Goa in connection with the case on May 4 for allegedly transferring a cash bribe from South Group to the election campaign of AAP during the Goa assembly elections in 2022.He was sent to jail by a Delhi court.The ED had told the court that Vinod Chauhan was involved in transferring proceeds of crime worth Rs 25.5 crore. The agency had added that Rs 1.06 crore was seized after Chauhan’s office was searched.ED also submitted before the court of special judge Kaveri Baweja that Kejriwal was the “kingpin” and “key conspirator” in the case. ""CM Kejriwal was part of the larger conspiracy to generate proceeds of crime. He ensured that there was no meaningful discussion,"" the ED counsel told the court.ED made the submissions on consideration of its supplementary chargesheet filed against Kejriwal and AAP in a money laundering case. The court reserved its order on whether to take cognisance of the supplementary chargesheet for June 4.The agency also told the court that part of Kejriwal's stay at a seven-star hotel in Goa was paid for using proceeds of the alleged crime and the payment was facilitated by Charanpreet Singh, another accused in the case who allegedly acquired money from hawala dealers, which was used for the Goa elections and other purposes.Further, ED told the court that stakeholders who were willing to invest but were not ready to accept these demands were left out. It claimed that the Punjab excise department was used to extract bribes for the Delhi liquor business.“There were some wholesalers in Punjab who didn’t agree to pay up and were then forced to go out of business. There was no reason for Mahadev Liquor to surrender their flourishing business,” said the agency.ED's counsel added that Vijay Nair, AAP’s former communications in-charge, claimed he could secure favours under the policy in exchange for funds for AAP.Elaborating on how AAP as a political entity could be prosecuted for money laundering, ED submitted it could be done under the Representation of the People Act as a political party was an association of individuals, which fulfilled the definition of a company and, hence, could be prosecuted.“Kejriwal had endorsed AAP’s former communications in-charge Vijay Nair, and he held meetings with people on behalf of Delhi govt and sought favours in the nature of party funds,” said the ED counsel.",Court to decide on taking note of supplementary chargesheet on June 4. ED says it has in its possession direct chats between Arvind Kejriwal and Vinod Chauhan.

On Jan 17, 2019, a CBI court sentenced him to life imprisonment for the Nov 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, just over four months after his then manager Ranjit Singh's killing.The verdict by Justices Sureshwar Thakur and Lalit Batra highlights multiple lapses in the probe into the former Dera manager's murder, including the revelation that the presumed murder weapon wasn't used in the crime. It also points out that the vehicle supposedly used in the murder was never seized.Justice Thakur said despite witnesses testifying that all four assailants were armed, CBI failed to confiscate any of these firearms. CBI also didn't present a site plan of the place where the alleged conspiracy to kill Ranjit was hatched on June 16, 2002, he said.The court observed that ""the intellectual strength"" of the investigating officer appeared to have ""become staticised by the glare of media publicity"".

Battle Royale? Mandi’s ‘king’ & ‘queen’ spar for supremacy with jibes & insults,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battle-royale-mandis-king-queen-spar-for-supremacy-with-jibes-insults/articleshow/110515901.cms,"MANDI: Coming out of an election gathering on a hot May afternoon in Takoli village of Himachal Pradesh ’s Mandi district, Krishna Vaidya is all smiles. “I had seen her in movies but never in real life. Today, my wish came true,” says Vaidya, who is in her late 50s and a resident of a nearby village.Vaidya is not alone.In almost all her political gatherings and rallies, actor Kangana Ranaut , BJP’s candidate from Mandi parliamentary constituency, gets immediately surrounded by fans, who come in droves, pulled by her big screen charisma.If political greenhorn Kangana is using Modi and movie magic to win the hearts of voters in Mandi, then her bête noire and seasoned politician Vikramaditya Singh , the Congress candidate and the scion of the erstwhile Bushahr princely state, is being helped by his royal tag and bloodline.The son of six-time late chief minister Virbhadra Singh and Congress state president Pratibha Singh, Vikramaditya is contesting from a rather familiar Mandi seat, which has been represented by his parents three times each.When the tickets were announced, it was hailed as the greatest election battle between a ‘king’ and a ‘queen.’ But it has turned out to be the ugliest political duel ever fought in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh.The first salvo was fired by Congress when its leader Supriya Shrinate in March posted on social media a sexist post with derogatory remarks against Kangana. Thereafter, it’s been a no-holds-barred slugfest.If Kangana in her election rallies has called Vikramaditya a ‘Chhota Pappu,’ a ‘spoiled shehzada,’ ‘someone who doesn’t respect women,’ then the latter’s jibes at the Bollywood actor include a ‘comedian,’ ‘a monsoon frog,’ an ‘imported leader,’ etc.Kangana hails from Bhambla village of Mandi district but Congress has been portraying her as an outsider, who did not stand with the people during the monsoon disaster last year and that she will rush back to Mumbai after elections.Kangana has also stayed away from touching any local issues in her election meetings and speeches and is just banking on Modi’s name.But this doesn’t seem to bother too many people too much at least in many constituencies that fall in Kangna’s home district of Mandi, where BJP had won 9 out of the 10 seats in the 2022 assembly elections — a factor that is expected to go in her favour on the polling day.Mandi is the largest parliamentary constituency of the state with 17 assembly constituencies that cover six of the 12 districts of the state from tribal belts of Bharmour and Lahaul-Spiti to Kullu, Manali, Mandi, Kinnaur and up to Shimla.“Kangana is the daughter of Mandi. She is a Mandial and belongs to this place. Moreover, Modi himself wanted her to contest elections from our constituency,” says Sanjay Kapoor, a shopkeeper from Mandi town.Using local dialect Mandiali in her speeches, Kangana seems to have struck a chord with the voters in areas of Mandi district but in the upper reaches of Kullu, Kinnaur, Shimla and Chamba, it’s Vikramaditya who seems to have an upper hand.“All my life I have voted for Raja sahib (Virbhadra Singh) and later Rani sahiba and now it's their son Vikramaditya, the Tikka sahib. You see the Raja family knows and understands this place, the people and the issues so well that they deserve to be elected as our leaders,” says Mahal Chand Negi, 65, a resident of Chhatenseri, a village near Manali populated by people from Kinnaur district.Along with promises of solving the long-pending issues of the people of Mandi constituency , Vikramaditya has also been making it a point to mention his father’s legacy and the Devniti, a religious code of the deities followed in the villages of the state, especially in areas of the upper Himachal, in all of his poll meetings.“It’s our responsibility to strengthen the Devniti. Rest assured, I will assist with all my support for all the religious and Devniti functions the way my father Raja Virbhadra Singh used to,” Vikramaditya told a cheering crowd at an election gathering in Sundernagar in Mandi on Monday.As June 1, the polling day in Himachal Pradesh, draws closer and the political temperature rises, both Kangana and Vikramaditya sweat it out throughout the length and breadth of Mandi constituency to win over the electorate. At stake in not only their reputations but also the shape of their future.",Kangana Ranaut is the BJP’s candidate from Mandi parliamentary constituency. Congress candidate Vikramaditya Singh is the scion of the erstwhile Bushahr princely state. The first salvo was fired by Congress when its leader Supriya Shrinate in March posted on social media a sexist post against Kangana.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110515956,imgsize-1880415,width-400,resizemode-4/110515956.jpg"

EC on Tuesday released not only the overall and gender-wise turnout data for all states and parliamentary seats where polling was held in Phase 6 but also the absolute electors data and the absolute count of votes cast in the phase. While the absolute figures for Phase 6 have been shared by EC just three days after polling, it had put out the corresponding data for all the first five phases only on May 25, a day after Supreme Court had declined to direct the poll body to place Form 17C voter details in the public domain.EC on Tuesday clarified that the data released by it was based on EVM votes and did not include postal ballot votes.

Busy diplomatic schedule awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/busy-diplomatic-schedule-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110510500.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a lull because of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, a hectic diplomatic schedule awaits the new government that will be sworn in some time late next week, subsequent to the June 4 poll results. The prime minister will literally hit the ground running, as the leader will travel to Italy for the G7 summit during June 13-15.The ministry of external affairs is preparing for the G7 summit, where the world's most advanced nations will discuss issues related to the global economic situation, international trade, climate and the effects of Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts.Even before that, the external affairs minister will be expected at the BRICS foreign ministers' meeting in Russia on June 11. Russia will host the BRICS summit in October.The Indian PM is expected to host Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in the last week of June, before participating in the SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July. This is also where the Indian PM will likely come face to face with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time after elections.However, one major event that any Indian PM or EAM will give a miss is the Ukraine peace summit , which Switzerland will host immediately after the G7. Russia's reservations about the summit coupled with Ukraine's insistence on blocking any invite to Moscow will preclude high-level participation by any Indian government. A secretary-level official will most likely represent India. Significantly, US President Joe Biden is yet to confirm his participation in the summit.Diplomacy, in fact, could take centerstage as early as the oath-taking of the PM next month. Like in 2014 and 2019, MEA is working on a guest list for the event, in line with India's strategic and economic interests. If the Modi government indeed returns, as many seem to be suggesting, the list is likely to be expanded to include countries from Africa, as also the Gulf region. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman are among the countries India could consider inviting. The inclusion of African Union in the G20 last year was among the top two achievements of India's presidency of the bloc, along with the Ukraine consensus that facilitated a joint declaration.The list may also include a few countries from India's neighbourhood too. The Modi government invited SAARC and BIMSTEC leaders in 2014 and 2019 respectively.","Diplomacy, in fact, could take centerstage as early as the oath-taking of the PM next month.

After they comply with the notices, they can be reopened.""The decision to shut down these facilities reflects either an abundance of caution by the govt or a lack of confidence in the current safety standards of gaming zones.Ahmedabad deputy municipal commissioner (urban development) IK Patel said the closures are precautionary. ""Shutting down all gaming zones does not mean that they were all unsafe. We are ensuring all major and minor concerns of experts are addressed for maximum safety of citizens,"" Patel explained.The govt is currently working on a new policy for entertainment facilities, which will encompass comprehensive safety guidelines. This new policy is expected to be announced soon, and gaming zones will be allowed to reopen once they comply with the updated regulations.""The home department will notify rules for entertainment zones that include gaming zones, amusement parks,"" an official source said. The move is part of govt's broader effort to enhance safety standards and prevent future tragedies similar to the fatal Rajkot blaze.","Gujarat government orders closure of all 101 registered gaming zones across eight major cities. The crackdown follows the tragic fire at TRP Game Zone in Rajkot that claimed 28 lives Saturday. Of the 101 gaming zones, 20 have been permanently sealed because of the lack of necessary authorisations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110510473,imgsize-1508978,width-400,resizemode-4/110510473.jpg"
