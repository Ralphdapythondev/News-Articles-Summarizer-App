She then in her affidavit stated that her highest educational qualification was 10in 1992 from Shillong but this time in the affidavit given to contest the East Tripura Lok Sabha constituency, she disclosed that he has passed HSC in 1990 from Meghalaya Board.“As per the electoral roll of Chhattisgarh, her name is Kriti Devi Singh but in Tripura, she changed her name to Kriti Devi Debbarma and is in the fray in the East Tripura constituency where the poll is scheduled on April 26,” Roy Barman alleged and asked if she changes her name in the affidavit, it must be published in the newspaper and voters need to know in which newspaper they gave advertisement.Since East Tripura is a Scheduled Caste reserved seat, ECI needs to publicize the scheduled tribe certificate of Kriti Devi Singh. Any citizen of India can contest elections in any constituency. There is no objection. But the name must be on the voter list. The certified copy of that name has to be submitted to ECI, he underlined.“Election is a high-level political struggle, there needs to be maintained ethics and utmost transparency and honesty. But in her case, it is missing, which we demand ECI to clarify or else we shall move to the appropriate court seeking justice. Because such inconsistent and confusing information is an amount to be cheating to the electorates,” Roy Barman added.",INDI Alliance sought clarification from the Election Commission of India regarding East Tripura BJP nominee Kriti Devi Debbarman.

Don't be selective: SC warns petitioners over mob lynching and cow vigilantism plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-be-selective-sc-warns-petitioners-over-mob-lynching-and-cow-vigilantism-plea/articleshow/109348884.cms,"What about Kanhaiya Lal case?: SC

SC seeks updates from states on measures against mob lynching and cow vigilantism



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked petitioners, who had moved the court to ensure action in incidents of mob lynching and cow vigilantism , not to be selective about which cases they choose to highlight before the top court.The directive came on a plea filed by the National Federation of Indian Women ( NFIW ), an organisation linked to the Communist Party of India, urging states to adhere to a 2018 Supreme Court verdict aimed at effectively addressing incidents of lynching and mob violence against Muslims by cow vigilantes.The bench -- comprising Justices BR Gavai, Aravind Kumar, and Sandeep Mehta -- asked advocate Nizam Pasha, representing NFIW, that all incidents should be mentioned in the petition and not selectively chosen from particular states.""You have to take all the incidents in the petition, we want to be sure that you're not selective,"" Justice Aravind Kumar asked Pasha.Justice Kumar asked Pasha whether Kanhaiya Lal's murder case was mentioned in the petition.Confused about the mention of the case, Pasha assured the court the incident would be mentioned in the petition if not mentioned, Live Law reported.Pasha assured the court that he is not selective in highlighting only certain incidents but would mention the incident of Kanhaiya Lal in the petition too.After hearing that Kanhaiya Lal's mob lynching incident is not mentioned by Pasha in the petition, senior advocate Archana Pathak Dave (for the State of Gujarat) alleged the petition was religiously biased stating that the petition concerned only Muslims and not other communities, said a report by Live Law.""That incident (Kanhaiya Lal's murder) was not mob lynching otherwise also. Let's not go by religion or caste. It is only allegation of mob lynching, action taken,"" Justice Mehta told Dave.The top court also asked the state government to respond within six weeks regarding actions taken in cases of mob lynching and cow vigilantism.""We find that most of the states have not filed their reply affidavits to the writ petition giving instances of mob lynching. It was expected of the states to at least respond to what action has been taken in such cases. We grant six weeks to the states who have not filed their replies and also give details of steps taken by them in such cases,"" the bench ordered.During the proceedings, advocate Pasha highlighted an alleged incident of mob lynching in Madhya Pradesh, where the victims were charged with cow slaughter. The bench asked, ""Are you trying to save someone? How can you register FIR for cow slaughter without even chemical analysis.""Pasha pointed out that the same thing happened in Haryana where a case for transporting beef was registered but not mob lynching.""The states are denying that there were any incident of mob lynching and FIRs are being registered for cow slaughter against the victims. Only two states Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have filed their affidavit on incidents pointed out in the writ petition and interlocutory applications but other states have not filed any affidavit,"" he submitted.Justice Kumar urged that incidents mentioned in the petitions should not be restricted to specific states or religions but should encompass all relevant occurrences. Meanwhile, Senior advocate Archana Pathak Dave emphasized that the relief sought should not be specific to any religion but should apply universally.In response, the bench asked Dave to observe restraint in her submissions, and said, ""Let's not go into the incidents based on religion. We should focus on the larger cause.""The top court posted the matter for hearing after summer vacation and ordered that states should file their replies on the steps taken to check mob lynching.On July 28, last year, the top court agreed to hear a plea that sought urgent intervention of the apex court given the ""alarming"" rise in cases of lynching and mob violence targeting Muslims despite clear guidelines and directions issued by the top court in 2018 concerning cow vigilantes.""In view of the alarming rise in cases of lynching and mob violence against the Muslim community, the petitioner is seeking a writ in the nature of mandamus to the concerned State authorities to take immediate action in terms of the findings and directions of this court in Tehseen Poonawalla so as to effectively contain and deal with the same,"" the plea said.In its 2018 verdict , the top court held the states have the principal obligation to see to it that vigilantism, be it cow vigilantism or any other vigilantism of any perception, does not take place, and issued guidelines to be adopted by the authorities to deal with such incidents.(With inputs from agency)",Supreme Court asks petitioners not to be selective about which cases they highlight.

I have always been treated as a political tool and a soft target for being connected to the Gandhi family ...People have felt that I should give them an answer not as a businessman but as an MP inside the Parliament.You will see whenever elections approach, my name is being used.""Previously, Vadra had expressed his willingness to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi if he decides to enter electoral politics.Amethi had been a traditional stronghold of the Gandhi family for a long time until BJP's Smriti Irani defeated Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, breaking the Gandhis' winning streak in the prestigious constituency.Addressing the allegations of Congress being an anti-Sanatani party, Robert Vadra responded, ""It is my thinking that we should remain secular and stay away from the politics of religion.

What a common thief is doing on the streets, the PM is doing at an international level,"" Gandhi alleged.During his campaign in Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, the Congress candidate accused the BJP-led central government of using sophisticated tactics to threaten targeted businessmen.He also lashed out at Modi, accusing him of helping a few rich businessmen in the country.""At the electoral bond level, the threats are much more sophisticated. The ED, CBI and Income Tax people will come, they will interrogate and at the end of it, they will say why don't you give this (their business) to (businessman) Adani,"" the sitting Congress MP from Wayanad LS constituency alleged.He alleged that this is how businessman Adani got the Mumbai airport from its previous owner.In other instances, such ""intimidatory tactics"" also led to the businessman paying the BJP in electoral bonds, the Congress MP alleged.He raised the electoral bond issue by referring to a recent interview of Modi.""In his interview, he was trying to defend the biggest corruption scandal on the planet -- the electoral bond scheme through which the BJP got thousands of crores of rupees by extorting India's businessmen,"" Gandhi alleged while speaking to party supporters, workers and the huge crowd that turned up for his roadshow from Kodiyathur in Kozhikode district.Later addressing people during another roadshow, Gandhi alleged that Modi ""does not have the understanding to run the country"".The Congress leader also mocked the PM for his statements asking people to bang steel utensils and switch on their mobile phone lights during the Covid-19 pandemic.Earlier in Kodiyathur, Gandhi alleged that Modi's job was also to distract people from the real issues in the country, protect the richest businessmen in India and ""forgive their bank loans"".Modi is helping ""five or six of the biggest, richest businessmen"" in India, he alleged during his campaign in areas falling under the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts of the state.He claimed that Modi has given around Rs 16 lakh crores to 20-25 people in the country.""But he does not talk of the issues farmers are facing in the country, the unemployment or the price rise,"" Gandhi saidHe said that since Modi was giving away money to a few rich people in the country, the Congress has decided to give money to the poor when it comes to power.He promised to give Rs one lakh per annum to one woman from every poor family in the country and his government will frame a law that will make it mandatory to provide one year paid internships or apprenticeships to every graduate or diploma holder in the country.Under the proposed law, the interns and apprentices will get Rs one lakh per year for their one year of training in their chosen field in the public or private sector or PSUs.For women, he has also assured to provide 50 per cent reservation in government jobs, PSUs and government companies.""We will also ensure reservation for women in Parliament and vidhan sabhas immediately,"" he added.Additionally, he also promised to double the wages of Asha workers and women working in Anganwadis if the Congress-led INDIA bloc comes to power.The Congress MP from Wayanad also said that the Agnipath scheme was an insult to the brave youth dreaming of joining the Indian Army and protecting the country and will be cancelled if the Congress-led alliance forms a government at the Centre.Gandhi also accused the BJP and the RSS of trying to destroy and change the Constitution and said that this was the only big issue of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and all other issues emanated from it.The Congress leader took out a massive road show from Kodiyathur here around 11.30 am as part of his ongoing campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in the southern state and was accompanied by hundreds of party workers and supporters who ran alongside and ahead of the vehicle carrying him.He intermittently sat atop the SUV or stood out of its sun roof constantly waving at the public gathered in large numbers on both sides of the road.Party workers and supporters accompanying him carried placards with his photo.Gandhi, who is hoping to win again from Wayanad, came to the constituency on April 15 for the second time after the date of the Lok Sabha polls were announced.The Congress leader had kicked off the poll campaign in Wayanad early this month by filing his nomination papers and holding a massive road show.He had won from Wayanad with a record margin of 4,31,770 votes during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Polling in Kerala 's 20 Lok Sabha seats will be held on April 26.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launches an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the electoral bond issue.

Refusing to extend open support to any political party, Tikait said he won't even tell his wife whom to vote for when the model code of conduct is in place but those who know him already know which party or candidate is good for farmers.In an exclusive interaction with PTI, Tikait, one of the key faces of the 2020-21 farmers' protest against the now-scrapped three agri laws, also claimed that people are not voting for the BJP but the party may still win as he alleged manipulation in the process.He claimed that today's BJP is no more just a political party and it has become a front for rich industrialists who are out to grab farmers' lands.""Farmers ka moh-bhang ho gaya hai, lekin wo hataash nahin hain (Farmers are disillusioned but they have not lost hope).""They'll cast their votes and come back to join the protest,"" he said when asked whether farmers and the Jat community have become disillusioned with all parties including BJP, Congress, SP, BSP and RLD.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader said the farmers can vote for anyone as per their conscience but they must stay with the movement.""Nota (None of the above) should not be pressed.

Those who will not have those numbers will lose,"" he said.Tikait stressed that neither he nor his outfit supported the BJP in 2014 though they may have backed some individual candidates.He also said that at that time, BJP as the main opposition party had made many promises to the farmers and there was hope that they would bring some changes.""When a party is in opposition, they raise people's voices. When the Congress was in power, we were opposing them, they (BJP) made many promises, they used to be with us in the meetings,"" he said.""Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh participated in our meetings several times.

Whoever comes is welcomed. Voting happens based on caste lines, religion, who is the candidate... .""Alleging possible manipulation in the elections by the ruling party and local administration, Tikait said, ""This happened in UP assembly polls, they would have won less than 80 seats, but officially they got 255.""""If one joins the BJP, there is a guarantee of victory.

They used a formula of 'one DM, one seat' because their party was not winning. So they said one district magistrate would make them win one seat.

Has there ever been a recount of an EVM?""After losing, a candidate has three options -- they can go to the Election Commission, but they don't do that.

The first category is of those happening over breakfast. They say we don't want anything except respect. The second ones join after lunch.

Rally after rally across Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Kashmir, the CM has elaborated on how no riot has taken place in UP during his seven years tenure, stating graphically how criminals fear being hung upside down if they do anything wrong.In Kathua, Yogi elaborated on how, if someone “does bak bak’’ (talks too much), “toh mirchi ka jhaunka neeche se laga diya jaata hai” (they are taught a harsh lesson). Describing his govt’s no nonsense approach to law and order, Yogi said there was no space for divisive politics on the basis of caste, religion, region, a result of which was that UP became the first state to remove loudspeakers from religious places.In Maharashtra, where the CM addressed three meetings in a day, he told a gathering in Wardha that the incident in Palghar where three people, including two seers were beaten to death on suspicion of kidnapping, would have never happened in UP because the culprits would be aware “ki hum unko ulta taang denge” (we will hang them upside down). The CM went on to give this example in every rally he addressed thereafter, stressing on how swift action by his govt had ensured that there were no riots or curfews in UP since he became the CM.Before 2017, the year he became CM, there were frequent riots and curfews in UP. Since 2017, even with a population of 25 crore, there has not been a single riot in the state while curfews were replaced by kanwar yatras, taken out with “dhoom dharaka”.In Bhandara and Nagpur, Yogi also spoke about the lakhs of devotees who have been visiting the Ram temple in Ayodhya but there has not been a single untoward incident till now. In fact, as he announced in Sikar in Rajasthan, more than 1.5 crore people had visited Ayodhya in the past two months.In Bhandara, he also spoke about how UP govt was giving respect to people’s faith, linking festivals to places they originated from. “UP used to be called Upadrav Pradesh (State marked by riots) but today it is called Utsav Pradesh (state where celebrations take place). There is only rule of law there and no politics of appeasement,” he said.In addition to this, the state had also ensured wide implementation of central and state schemes. In addition to building the Ram temple, he said, govt had also provided houses to 4 crore people under PM Awas Yojana. Along with this, 10 crore free gas connections had been given while 12 crore farmers had been linked with the PM Kisan Yojana.","Yogi Adityanath is making sure that his own brand of administration, especially with regard to law and order, is prominently on display.

Riding high on M-Y factor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/riding-high-on-m-y-factor/articleshow/109338209.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even before the Lok Sabha poll fervour started peaking, the BJP built up a groundswell, ratcheting up ‘Brand Modi ’, an exercise that helped the party reach out to around 20% of UP’s population within three-and-a-half months.This was ‘ Viksit Bharat Abhiyan ’, which aimed for a ground level implementation of welfare schemes initiated by the BJP govt.The tagline — ‘Modi ki guarantee’ — marked BJP’s assertive bid to wheel out the ‘welfarism’ narrative and dispel a potential anti-incumbency stoked by the opposition.Data assessed by TOI reveal that the campaign , carried out in two phases, from Nov 15, 2023 to Jan 29, 2024 and then again between Feb 8 and Feb 29, rolled around 25 programmes for students, sportspersons, artists, women, farmers and the sick.As many as 650 vans moved through the state as BJP workers including MPs, MLAs and MLCs coordinated with govt officials in taking welfare schemes to the doorsteps of the needy.UP BJP state general secretary and in charge of the campaign, Subhash Yaduvansh told TOI that at least 250 BJP MLAs and more than 50 MLCs were tasked to remain present at the spots where the vans reached. PM Narendra Modi and BJP national president JP Nadda too took part in the campaign in Varanasi and Gorakhpur, respectively.“The idea was to turn the campaign into a ‘Jan andolan’ (public movement) that could bolster BJP’s outreach while countering opposition’s negative narrative,” Yaduvansh said. Records show that around 3.81 crore people turned up in different camps organised by BJP in coordination with the govt. The maximum turnout of over 73 lakh people was recorded in the Awadh region comprising 15 districts. This was followed by Gorakhpur (68.9 lakh), Braj (66.5 lakh), Kashi (64.9 lakh, West UP (58.2 lakh) and Kanpur-Bundelkhand (49.3 lakh).The campaign has evoked sharp criticism from the opposition. “The ‘Viksit Bharat Abhiyan’ was purely a vote seeking exercise, carried out by the public exchequer and misusing govt machinery. It was nothing but a publicity stunt,” said SP national spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi. He maintained that material highlighting BJP promises is still being distributed clandestinely. The commission should take cognizance of this and stop it immediately, he said.“BJP strategy is two pronged: Hindutva and development. This is a typical case of stirring up developmental narrative at the ground level, especially in rural areas where people go by what they see,” said political expert JP Shukla. This, he said, was somewhat in contrast to urban areas where people are more educated and have independent opinions. “Politics is not social work. It is about drumming up the works done or proposed to be done by a political outfit,” he said.",‘ Viksit Bharat Abhiyan ’ aimed for a ground level implementation of welfare schemes initiated by the BJP govt.

""But he does not talk of the issues farmers are facing in the country, the unemployment or the price rise,"" Gandhi said while speaking to party supporters, workers and the huge crowd that turned up for his roadshow from Kodiyathur in this district.On the electoral bonds issue, he said the bonds were a form of extortion carried out by PM Modi . Accusing the BJP and the RSS of trying to destroy and change the Constitution, he said that this was the only big issue of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and all other issues emanated from it.He took out a massive road show from Kodiyathur here around 11.30 am as part of his ongoing campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in the southern state and was accompanied by hundreds of party workers and supporters who ran alongside and ahead of the vehicle carrying him.He intermittently sat atop the SUV or stood out of its sun roof constantly waving at the public gathered in large numbers on both sides of the road.

The dejection was evident on his face as he struggled to control his emotions.The five-time champions had a rough start to the tournament, losing their first three matches consecutively against Gujarat Titans (by 6 runs), Sunrisers Hyderabad (by 31 runs), and Rajasthan Royals (by 6 wickets).However, they managed to get their campaign back on track with two wins against Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru. But succumbed to another defeat against Chennai Super Kings by 20 runs.After the defeat, Pandya, during the post-match presentation, had said: ""There's a man (Dhoni) behind the stumps who tells them what's working.""This comment seemed to suggest that Mumbai Indians lack the same level of guidance and support that CSK enjoys under Dhoni's leadership.Former Australia wicket-keeper batsman Adam Gilchrist , analysing Pandya's post-match comments, concluded that not everything is running smoothly within the Mumbai Indians camp.""That line about Dhoni is interesting. It tells that maybe he is feeling a bit of a lone wolf at the moment. Maybe it is all having a bit of an effect because he is having the feeling that he has not got support around him. But his observation of the opposition is that hang on, he (Gaikwad) has got the support there, an experienced one obviously. It tells me a bit about the mindset of Hardik at the moment and the uncertainty and hesitation in the MI dugout,"" Gilchrist said on Cricbuzz.""High-profile teams are a victim of their own success. There are often trades that come out of the blue, and fans feel like, 'hand on, we are not invested in this'. They feel that they are part of this big picture and hence feel blindsided. The way this Hardik traded came out of nowhere and the transition from Rohit to Hardik...whether Rohit was happy or not or if he was considered or not.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

Interim Budget 2024: National Pension System Update and Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-2024-national-pension-system-update-and-details/articleshow/106926120.cms,"Budget 2024 : The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS ). The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme, is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.According to an ET report, the committee has explored certain adjustments and assurances during its discussions.However, the members are reluctant to increase the financial burden or revert to the old pension scheme , as per the mentioned sources. The government may opt for public consultations before making any decisions.""The fine print is being worked out,"" one of the officials told the financial daily. The report will center on improving the NPS while addressing concerns from some pensioners compared to the old pension scheme (OPS).""The report will not be prescriptive and any changes, if at all required, will be weighed against the fiscal impact and it will be then put for the public consultation,"" the official further added.In April of the previous year, the government established a committee to examine the matter of pensions within the NPS for government employees. The committee's mandate was to propose solutions for enhancing NPS pension benefits while taking fiscal considerations into account.The National Pension System has been applied to all central government employees who joined on or after January 1, 2004, excluding those in the armed forces. As per the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), with the exception of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, all state governments have notified and implemented the NPS for their employees.The controversy surrounding the NPS intensified last year when states governed by the Congress party, including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Himachal Pradesh, opted to return to the previous defined benefit system. Under this system, government employees were entitled to receive 50% of their last-drawn salary as a monthly pension. In contrast, the NPS operates as a defined contribution scheme, where employees build a retirement corpus. It is noteworthy that Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have since transitioned to BJP-led governments.The opposition argues that state government employees shouldn't depend on the unpredictable stock market where NPS funds are invested. States that returned to the old pension system also requested a refund of the accumulated NPS corpus, but the government rejected it, stating it's not possible under current laws.The government has said that the old pension scheme is not financially viable because it continually increases the burden on the treasury, which is why it was discontinued.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and numerous economists have voiced opposition to reinstating the old pension scheme. They argue that such a decision would disrupt the fiscal equilibrium of the states.Last month, the government informed the Rajya Sabha that there is currently no proposal being considered for the reinstatement of the old pension scheme (OPS) for central government employees.","The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS) The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.

Harendra Singh returns as women's hockey coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/harendra-singh-returns-as-womens-hockey-coach/articleshow/109149134.cms,"BENGALURU: Soon after Janneke Schopman quit as the head coach of the Indian women’s hockey team, a top contender to succeed the Dutchwoman was a familiar name in hockey circles — Harendra Singh . Sure enough, the Dronacharya award winner, who has coached various Indian teams, including the senior men and women forover two decades, has taken over as the head coach of the senior women’s team.Harendra, who until recently served as coach of the USA men’s hockey team, returned to the country to join the women’s camp last week. Sources in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) confirmed that Harendra has been involved in pruning the 60-member assessment squad to a core group of 33 during the trials held on April 6 and 7.It is learnt that Harendra is in the process of putting together a team of support staff after most of them left along with Schopman.An official announcement from Hockey India has been put on hold due to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in place for the Lok Sabha elections. Apart from sports ministry protocols, hockey federation has to follow the MCC since their president and ex-India captain Dilip Tirkey is contesting the election from Sundargarh constituency in Odisha as a Biju Janata Dal candidate.As a coach, Harendra’s career with Indian hockey began in 1997, and under him India have won 11 gold medals including the 2016 men’s junior World Cup, 2017 women’sAsia Cup and 2018 Asian Champions Trophy (men).Harendra was brought in as the senior men’s coach in 2017. During his tenure, which lasted over a year, India claimed the bronze at the 2018 Asian Games and finished fifth at the FIH World Cup at home. The following year, Harendra was ‘demoted’ as the junior coach.In 2021, Harendra moved to the USA.Earlier this year, Harendra helped the USA women’s team, which incidentally defeated India on home turf, to qualify for the Olympics this year. Harendra, who has always wanted to return to India to coach, has been handed the reins until the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.Harendra has a challenging job on hand. With the sword of Damocles hanging over his head — which is a norm in Indian hockey — he will have to rebuild the team from scratch.After finishing fourth at Tokyo Olympics under Dutchman Sjoerd Marijne, the women’s team has courted controversy regularly. From seasoned star Rani Rampal being unceremoniously dumped from the squad to failing to qualify for the Paris Games, and Schopman leaving amidst allegations of not being treated fairly, women’s hockey has hit a new low.The onus will be on Harendra to not only build a team but also reinforce interest in women’s game.","Janneke Schopman quit as the head coach of the Indian women’s hockey team.
