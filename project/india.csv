Did Shashi Tharoor go wrong with words? Flak after 'memorable day' in Wayanad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-shashi-tharoor-go-wrong-with-words-flak-after-memorable-day-in-wayanad/articleshow/112257624.cms,"Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor , often known for his verbal flair and choice of words, found himself at the receiving end of things after he shared a video of relief work in landslide-hit Wayanad with a caption ""memorable"", which since has drawn widespread flak from many quarters.The four time MP from Thiruvananthapuram shared a video on X from his relief work and captioned it, “Some memories of a memorable day in Wayanad.” After the post drew ire, Tharoor responded, defending his usage of ""memorable"", explaining its meaning.The video features Tharoor unloading aid supplies from a truck, followed by scenes of his visit to relief camps and areas affected by landslides.The Congress MP known to be a wordsmith, however was not spared by the wrath of the words going wrong with many deeming it insensitive. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to slam the Congress leader and responded to his post saying, ""Deaths and disaster are memorable for Shashi Tharoor"".The same sentiment was echoed by several others, with some reiterating Amit Malviya's comment.“Memorable”? Hundreds died, Shashi. Don’t be like Rahul for whom everything is fun and frolic,"" one social media user wrote.""Meet elite MP Shashi Tharoor. He went to tragedy-hit Wayanad to have a ""memorable"" day,"" another user added.However, Tharoor saw no issue with referring to it as a ""memorable day.""In a follow-up post on X, he explained, ""For all the trolls: the definition of 'memorable' is something worth remembering or likely to be remembered because it is special or unforgettable. That’s all I meant.""On July 30, three massive landslides devastated the areas of Meppadi, Mundakkai Town, and Chooralmala in Wayanad, destroying entire villages. By Saturday, the death toll had risen to 358, with rescuers still retrieving bodies and body parts from the rubble.Rescue operations were scaled up on Saturday with the use of advanced radars, drones, and heavy machinery to find survivors or recover deceased individuals. Additionally, the state government announced plans to create a new township to rehabilitate those displaced by the disaster.","Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor shared a video of relief work in landslide-hit Wayanad with a caption ""memorable"" The four time MP from Thiruvananthapuram was not spared by the wrath of the words going wrong with many deeming it insensitive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112257946,imgsize-1762543,width-400,resizemode-4/112257946.jpg"

"'Creamy layer' not snatching pie, signals unfilled SC/ST posts data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creamy-layer-not-snatching-pie-signals-unfilled-sc/st-posts-data/articleshow/112256269.cms,"NEW DELHI: While it is true that some sub-castes within scheduled castes and some tribes within scheduled tribes miss out on the benefits of reservation , a significant part of SC/ST quotas in government jobs goes unfilled every year, raising the question of whether the 'dominant' sub-castes and tribes are really keeping the more deprived ones out. Data also shows that the proportion of unfilled posts increases as we move up the chain towards more senior posts.According to a 2023 report of the parliamentary committee on the welfare of scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs), the only category of jobs in ministries and departments of the central government where SCs and STs have a share larger than their quota of 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively are the Group C jobs excluding safai karamcharis and an even larger share among safai karamcharis or sanitation workers. More than one third (37 per cent) of the safai karamcharis employed in central government ministries are from scheduled castes and 7.4 per cent are tribals.In comparison, in Group A jobs just 13 per cent are SCs and 5.5 per cent are STs. Due to the high representation of SCs and STs in lower categories of jobs, it looks like they more than fill their quota overall 18.4 per cent SCs and 7.4 per cent STs in posts and services under the central government. According to the Parliamentary report, in spite of special drives, relaxation in qualifying criteria and pre-promotional training, ministries or departments were unable to fill the thousands of backlog reserved vacancies.Thus, even with some 'dominant' scheduled castes or tribes taking advantage of the quotas, they remain unfilled year after year. Data available on 45 central universities also shows a similar pattern. SCs constituted under 11 per cent of teaching posts and STs less than 5 per cent . In non-teaching posts, SCs had a share of under 10 per cent and STs just a bit over 5 per cent .Once again, the shares are lowest in the senior most positions. ""This fact is obfuscated by only talking of the overall representation of dalits and tribals in government jobs. There are thousands of unfilled posts in government because the quotas are not being filled. Clearly, despite having a small section of relatively better off SCs, the government is unable to fill the quota. It is estimated that barely 1.9 per cent of SCs earn above 50,000. Most of these would be in government service as historically SCs have no assets, neither land nor businesses,"" pointed out M S Nethrapal, an Indian Revenue Service officer who researches issues of Bahujan representation in jobs and education. He added that there was not enough data on the various sub-categories within SC, as data is only collected at a broad level for all SCs as a single category.The lack of sub-classification leading to the more deprived among SCs or STs missing out would hold true only if the quota was being filled.If the quota was not being filled, then nobody could be said to be missing out because someone else was getting. However, unlike in jobs/posts, the quotas usually get filled when it comes to seats in educational institutions run by the government, like medical colleges, engineering colleges anduniversities.",Some sub-castes within scheduled castes and some tribes within scheduled tribes miss out on the benefits of reservation. A significant part of SC/ST quotas in government jobs goes unfilled every year. Data also shows that the proportion of unfilled posts increases as we move up the chain towards more senior posts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112256497,imgsize-889591,width-400,resizemode-4/112256497.jpg"
"India, China run risk of falling into 'middle income trap': World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-run-risk-of-falling-into-middle-income-trap-world-bank/articleshow/112253855.cms,"NEW DELHI: At current trends, it will take India 75 years to reach a quarter of US per capita income while China will take over 10 years, a World Bank report has said as it cautioned countries from falling into what is known as ' middle income trap '. The alert comes amidst India setting a target of being a developed nation by 2047.China, Vietnam and several other middle-income countries have also set plans for raising their per capita incomes to match those of developed nations.The report says, more than 100 countries - including China, India, Brazil and South Africa - face serious obstacles that could hinder their efforts to become high-income countries in the next few decades.The 'World Development Report 2024: The Middle-Income Trap' finds that as countries grow wealthier, they usually hit a ""trap"" at about 10% of annual US GDP per person - the equivalent of $8,000 today. That's in the middle of the range of what World Bank classifies as 'middle-income' countries.Since 1990, only 34 middle-income economies managed to shift to high-income status - more than a third of them were either beneficiaries of integration into European Union or of previously undiscovered oil.In 2007, World Bank published a report that coined the phrase 'middle-income trap'. This was during a decade of growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. ""Yet it was clear that many economies - particularly in Latin America and Middle East - had remained stuck for decades, despite their efforts to rise to high-income status,"" says the report.The agency provides a growth framework for developing countries to escape 'middle-income trap'. The report proposes a '3i strategy' for countries to reach high-income status. Depending on their stage of development, countries need to adopt a sequenced and progressively sophisticated mix of policies. Low-income countries can focus on policies designed to increase investment - the '1i' phase. Once they attain lower-middle-income status, they need to shift gears and expand the policy mix to the '2i' phase - investment and infusion, which consists of adopting technologies from abroad and spreading them across the economy.""At upper-middle-income level, countries should shift gears again to the final 3i phase: investment, infusion, and innovation. In the innovation phase, countries no longer merely borrow ideas from global frontiers, they push the frontier,"" according to the World Bank report.","At current trends, it will take India 75 years to reach a quarter of US per capita income while China will take over 10 years. The alert comes amidst India setting a target of being a developed nation by 2047. China, Vietnam and several other middle-income countries have also set plans for raising their per capita incomes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112254083,imgsize-1438621,width-400,resizemode-4/112254083.jpg"

"After Wayanad landslides, Centre issues 6th draft notification proposing over 56k sq km of Western Ghats eco sensitive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-wayanad-landslides-centre-issues-6th-draft-notification-proposing-over-56k-sq-km-of-western-ghats-eco-sensitive/articleshow/112231199.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three days after the massive landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, the Centre on Friday released a sixth draft notification proposing earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ecologically sensitive area ( ESA ) to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats , spread over six states.The draft for the first time proposed a provision where the final ESA notification can be taken up “in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification” - a move which may speed up the process without waiting for all six states to be on board at the same time.The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30. The ESA issue has been pending since August 2011 when a central panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, recommended the govt to take it up on priority to save the fragile terrain in six states.The environment ministry that notified the sixth draft in official gazette a day after the tragedy on Wednesday said the proposal would be “taken into consideration” for publishing final notification of ESA on or after the expiry of a period of sixty days from the date on which copies of the gazette are made available to the public.The ministry, meanwhile, sought “objections or suggestions” on the proposals contained in the draft. Except for the provision of notification in a “phased manner”, the sixth draft broadly replicates the fifth one, issued in July 2022, whose validity expired on June 30.Accordingly, it proposed the ESA of 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, and recommended prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting (Red category) industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of the existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting (Orange & White categories) industries.The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdiction in the Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014 but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry had issued four more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.The central govt and an expert committee had discussed the fifth draft with states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - nine times during July, 2022-March, 2024 but it could not finalise the ESA notification due to objection from states - initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa and later mainly from Karnataka.The then Karnataka govt even requested the Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect the livelihood of people due to ban on certain activities.The draft, however, clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30.

How UP managed to give quiet passage to 'explosive' Nazul Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/how-up-managed-to-give-quiet-passage-to-explosive-nazul-bill/articleshow/112234601.cms,"On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.

LUCKNOW: When UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary, an MLC, referred the Nazul Property (Management and Use for Public Purpose) Bill 2024 tabled by his own governmentt in the assembly to a select committee of the Upper House, it was initially taken as another episode of govt vs organisation in UP. However, a close examination reveals that it was a well-coordinated move by BJP to blunt any opposition attack over the issue.On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.The idea was to get back land grabbed by land mafia and others and from those who violated lease rules .However, it gradually became apparent that its impact went well beyond land parcels occupied by land mafia. ""For example, a major part of Prayagraj city has been settled on Nazul land,"" said a BJP functionary. No wonder when the assembly passed the bill on Wednesday prominent among those who spoke against it were BJP MLAs from Prayagraj Siddharth Nath Singh and Harshvardhan Bajpayee. They were followed by Raja Bhaiyya (JD-L) and Aradhana Mishra (Cong), both MLAs from neighbouring Pratapgarh district. NDA partners also objected.A BJP member told TOI that around 50,000 families were annoyed with the ordinance and this was one of the factors for the party losing the Allahabad Lok Sabha seat. ""Resentment was brewing not only in Prayagraj but also in other districts,"" said a BJP MLA. ""The number of such Nazul land holders is in lakhs.""BJP, already on the backfoot after the LS poll result, realised the bill may adversely impact its prospects in the upcoming bypolls. CM Yogi Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Maurya and Brajesh Pathak, state BJP chief Chaudhary and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna went into a huddle to find an honourable exit route.A BJP MLA said the first step was to ensure it was passed in the lower House without offering SP an opportunity to protest. ""The objections raised by BJP MLAs were part of this move,"" he claimed. It was decided that in Vidhan Parishad, a BJP member should object to the bill and Chaudhary could refer it to the select committee. Asked why the bill was tabled when the ordinance itself was opposed, a BJP MLA said the protest was mainly limited to Prayagraj and surrounding areas. ""It was thought that objections would be addressed through amendments,"" he added.","On March 7, 2024, Yogi government notified the ordinance which barred conversion of Nazul land into freehold in favour of a private person.

UDAIPUR: Tension prevailed in Banswara district after residents of Chhoti Sarwan village clashed with police on Friday over the construction of a boundary wall for the proposed Mahi Nuclear Power Plant . PM Narendra Modi is expected to lay the foundation stone of the 2,800 MW plant soon.The altercation, which lasted about three hours, left three police personnel and several villagers injured.Twelve people, including a local functionary of the Bharat Adivasi Party, have been detained. The residents, who were protesting their relocation, hurled stones at police, who were there to evacuate the govt-acquired land and facilitate the building of the boundary wall by the Nuclear Power Corporation of In dia Ltd (NPCIL).About 3,000 people from six villages — Bari, Sajwania, Rail, Kharia Dev, Aadibhit and Katumbi — are being relocated. Some protesters retreated to a nearby hill and continued hurling stones. In response, police fired tear gas shells and dispersed a group of women obstructing National Highway 927-A.Banswara SP Harshvardhan Agarwala said teargas shells were fired to control the situation at the site of the Central govt project in Chhoti Sarwan. A Quick Response Team (QRT) jawan, Kalpesh Garasiya, sustained a head injury and was admitted to a hospital in Banswara.“Some people, whose land has been acquired for the proposed plant, are protesting even though they have been allotted alternative plots,” Agarwala said.The govt has provided a compensation of Rs 415 crore to acquire 553 hectares of land for the project. A 60-hectare plot of land has also been identified in nearby Kharia Dev to construct houses for the displaced villagers.The local populace, however, has been unwilling to relocate until their demands, including the establishment of ahospital, are met.In July, thousands of tribal people had assembled at Mangarh Dham in Banswara to raise their concerns and demand scrapping of the proposed nuclear power plant. The villagers had also boycotted the Lok Sabha elections over their demands.","Residents of Chhoti Sarwan village clashed with police on Friday over the construction of a boundary wall for the proposed Mahi Nuclear Power Plant.

The month of August marks a period of heightened involvement in academic and extracurricular activities for both school and college students. With the commencement of the new school year or semester in the previous month following summer vacations, students are deeply immersed in their studies and regular class attendance.August is also notable for several culturally significant holidays that are important to students and other stakeholders.Unlike July, which had almost no holidays, August 2024 offers students multiple school holidays, providing opportunities for relaxation amidst their ongoing classes and school activities.Schools across India will observe holidays for Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi, and Krishna Janmashtami. Additionally, in the middle of the month, India will celebrate its 77th Independence Day, a national holiday during which schools, colleges, and other institutions will be closed.Overall in the month of August 2024, there are a total of nine school holidays, including Saturdays and Sundays. Here's the complete list-Independence Day commemorates India's liberation from British colonial rule in 1947.

'Juvenile terrorist': 11-year-old arrested for threatening Florida schools with bombs and shootings

An 11-year-old boy from Henrico County, Virginia, was arrested for making over 20 violent threats to schools in multiple states, including Florida. He targeted several schools and made bomb and shooting threats. The boy admitted to the crimes, and disturbing content was found in his possession. He now faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges.

NEW DELHI: A school in south Delhi’s Kailash Colony received a bomb threat via email on Friday. However, after a meticulous search, it was found to be a hoax . A 14-year-old kid has been identified as the suspect.“The administration of Summer Fields School reported receiving an email message at 12.30 am at the school’s email address. The content of the email insinuated that an explosive device had been surreptitiously planted within the school premises, thereby posing an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of the students and staff,” a senior police officer said.“Tomorrow there will be a blast at the school,” the email read.The officer said that in the email, it was written that “the sender is a Pakistani General.” The mail also urged school authorities to take the email seriously.“A bomb disposal squad team, along with the local police, swiftly arrived at the school and meticulously scoured the entire premises for any traces of the alleged explosive device. Despite their comprehensive search for over two hours, no suspicious objects or explosive materials were uncovered, much to the relief of everyone involved,” the officer stated further. After an initial probe, the boy was identified as the suspect. He allegedly sent the mail because he did not want to go to school the next day, police sources said. So far, the boy has not been apprehended.This was not the first time such an incident happened in Delhi. On May 1, at least 200 schools received emails which warned them about a bomb on their premises, leading to widespread panic.Later, several hospitals, IGI Airport and Tihar Jail had received hoax emails about bombs at their premises. Next were colleges, as at least 15 of them in Delhi were targeted by bomb threats.","Summer Fields School in Delhi's Greater Kailash area received a bomb threat via email.

Government set to bring bill to curb waqf board powers on assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-bring-bill-to-curb-waqf-board-powers-on-assets/articleshow/112253430.cms,"Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards

NEW DELHI: In a major step, government wants to curb the ""unfettered"" powers of Waqf Boards to declare any property a 'waqf asset' and take control of it.Sources said the Cabinet on Friday evening discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013), including ones to check the jurisdiction, considered arbitrary in many quarters, of Waqf Boards which now control assets running into lakhs of crores of rupees across the country.Under the proposed amendments, Waqf Boards' claims, which were previously unrestricted, will be subject to mandatory verification. A similar mechanism of mandatory verification has been proposed also for properties for which Waqf Boards and individual owners have made claims and counter-claims.Though an official briefing on Friday evening on Cabinet decisions did not mention this move, sources indicated that a Bill to amend the Wakf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week.Sources also said that the two provisions of mandatory verification of properties, which would check arbitrary powers of Waqf Boards, are the major amendments proposed to the Act. At present, these entities have powers to tag any property as waqf asset. More than 8.7 lakh properties across the country, totalling around 9.4 lakh acres, are under the jurisdiction of Waqf Boards.The need for such legislation arose as there were several representations from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Shia and Bohras, among others, seeking changes in the existing law, sources said, underlining that the preparation to bring amendments had started much before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. They also added that preliminary perusal of the laws across Islamic nations such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and others show that none of these countries have given such sweeping powers to one entity.More sweeping powers were conferred on Waqf Boards by bringing amendments to the original Act during the UPA govt in 2013, which have been a major bone of contention among waqf authorities, individual property owners, and several state entities, including the Archaeological Survey of India.TOI has learned that the Bill also proposes changes in the composition of Waqf Boards and also seeks to repeal some provisions of the current law.The Wakf Act, 1995 was enacted to regulate ‘auqaf’ (assets donated and notified as waqf) by a wakif — the person who dedicates a property for any purpose recognised by the Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable.Earlier, govt had taken note of sweeping powers of state Waqf Boards to stake claim on any property and also delay in conducting a survey of such property in most states. Government had also considered the possibility of involving district magistrates in monitoring of waqf properties to prevent misuse of the assets. Sources said the flaws in the appeal process were also under scrutiny.","Cabinet discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013) Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards.

BAREILLY: An angry mob took matters into its own hands at a village in UP and set on fire the house of a 21-year-old man for allegedly eloping with a woman, 20, of another community from the same neighbourhood.When police arrived at the scene on Friday night, the mob vandalised their vehicle too.The cops somehow managed to escape and informed their superiors, who sent additional forces from nearby police stations to bring the situation under control.SSP (Bareilly), Anurag Arya, said on Saturday, ""The incident took place at Chandupura Shivnagar under Sirauli limits of Bareilly district. There was a complaint that a 20-year-old woman had eloped with her neighbour Mohd Saddam on July 29. Both were traced on Thursday night and the woman was handed over to her father on Friday. Saddam was detained for questioning. Later at night, a few anti-social elements vandalised some items at Saddam's house and set a charpoy on fire. An FIR was registered against the perpetrators -- 21 identified and 30 unknown -- under the BNS section of rioting, and another FIR was registered against Saddam for abduction on the complaint of the woman's father.""Arya added: ""SHO of Sirauli, Luv Sirohi, sub-inspector Satveer Singh and a constable were suspended for negligence. Over 100 police personnel are now deployed in the village to maintain law and order. Further investigations are on.""An official, privy to the case details, said, ""The village has around 10% minority population and the main occupation is farming.

He, however, gave in writing that he didn't want any action against Saddam. But, on Friday night, the situation turned violent. The mob broke the house door, vandalised items inside and set it on fire. Dial 112 team arrived and came under attack as well. Additional forces were thereafter called in.""Locals at Chandupura Shivnagar said that ""no one is in favour of violence"" and appreciated the police presence. Village head, Pravesh Kumar, told TOI: ""There was never any communal tension here and we always lived in peace. Situation turned ugly after the Muslim man eloped with the daughter of a farmer. Since people from the woman's community are more in number; they targeted Saddam's house."" The woman's mother said, ""Saddam and his aides often used to threaten my daughter.

‘Now, a mammoth rock sits where our house stood’

MEPPADI (WAYANAD): Fate can't be much crueller than this. Eleven members of Kalathingal Nousheeba's family have been swept away by the Mundakkai landslide - her father, mother, elder brother, two sisters-in-law and six nieces and nephews - all of whom were staying at her ancestral house at Mundakkai that fateful night. As if this immense loss was not enough, Nousheeba has also lost five members of her husband's family - her mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and their two children.Grief-stricken Nousheeba (40) has been standing before the Meppadi family health centre for the last three days with swollen eyes.She walks up to the makeshift pandal each time a new body dug out of the landslide ravaged villages of Chooralmala and Meppadi is brought in for identification.On Saturday, a new body wrapped in white cloth with ""Number 168-Female child"" written on it in blue ink was brought. The volunteer asked out loud if there was anyone to identify the body. Nousheeba walked up to check, thinking it could be her niece, but found it wasn't her. She's been repeating this traumatic routine for the last three days.When Nousheeba walked up to the body along with her daughters Nahla and Thafseena, the volunteer showed them the leg of the body, saying the face cannot be shown as it is badly disfigured. The mehendi on the fingers brought a flicker of recognition and Nousheeba contemplated the possibility of the body being of her niece, Shahla. But Thafseena spotted an anklet on the leg and said it wasn’t her cousin as she didn’t wear anklets. So the family walked back.“I have lost all my family. I have to stand here waiting (to see) if at all they are brought in. All of them were staying in my father’s house just in front of the Mundakkai mosque. My elder brother and his five-member family, who were staying in the estate quarters, had come to be with my father in view of the heavy rains. There were 11 family members in the house, and all went missing after the landslide swept away the entire house without a trace,” said Nousheeba.She said the bodies of her father Kunhammed, mother Ayisha, and her two nieces — Ayisha Amana and Nafla — have been found, but all the others, including brother Mansoor, his wife Muhsina, their two children Shahla and Shafna, and her sister-in-law Sajna (younger brother Noufal’s wife) and the couple’s two children, Nihal and Isha Mehrin, are missing.“I was staying in my house, which is close by, as my husband had come on leave a month ago. Otherwise I, too, would have been swept away with all of them. On hearing the loud thunderous sound, we ran up the woods and stayed there the entire night. It was when dawn broke that I saw that my ancestral house and all my dear ones who stayed there were gone,” said Nousheeba.“At the place where our house stood now sits a mammoth rock,” she said, adding that her niece Shahla’s wedding had been fixed for Sept 22.Nousheeba has also lost her mother-in-law Pathuma, sisters-in-law Sumayya and Nazeera, and Nazeera’s children Munaveer and Rinsha Fathima. The bodies of Sumayya, Nazeera and Munaveer have been recovered.","Eleven members of Kalathingal Nousheeba's family have been swept away by the Mundakkai landslide.

She also served as 'Asthana Narthaki' at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams.For her contribution to the enrichment of Bharatanatyam, she received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1977.Yamini began her dance journey at the tender age of five, when she embarked on Bharatanatyam training at Kalakshetra in Chennai (then Madras) under the legendary Rukmini Devi Arundale. She also trained under the late Vidwan Ellappa Pillai of Kancheepuram.Under the tutelage of renowned gurus, she mastered the intricacies of this dance form, later expanding her repertoire to include Kuchipudi and Odissi.Her debut performance in 1957 marked the beginning of a stellar career characterised by the innovation and the artistry.Yamini's unique approach to rhythm and her ability to infuse traditional forms with contemporary interpretations revolutionised Bharatanatyam.Her interests and influence extended beyond dance, as she excelled in classical singing, veena playing, and the study of Hindu scriptures. She also founded a Bharatanatyam dance school in Delhi, where she trained countless dancers.She also contributed articles on various aspects of dance traditions to leading journals of the country, and authored a book titled 'A Passion For Dance: My Autobiography'.Through her artistry and mentorship, she inspired generations of dancers and continued to be a beacon of excellence in the world of classical dance.Her body will be brought to her dance school in Delhi on Sunday.

Meanwhile, speaking to media in Nagpur, Fadnavis said, ""I haven't read Waze's letter. I learnt about it through media reports. If Waze indeed sent such a letter, its authenticity will be verified, and an investigation will follow.""NCP-SP's Jayant Patil said, ""Nowadays, a person in jail is also giving an interview. There are serious allegations against him (Waze), I don't think I need to reply to him."" Waze spoke to the media on Friday when a police team was escorting him from court to jail. The case recently made it back to the news after Deshmukh claimed that Fadnavis had attempted to pressure him into filing false affidavits against Uddhav Thackeray, his son Aaditya, then deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and former minister Anil Parab three years ago.In 2021, during the tenure of the MVA govt led by Thackeray, the then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that then home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from orchestra bars in Mumbai for him. Singh had made the allegation after Deshmukh shunted him from the police commissioner's post following the Antilia bomb scare and the Mansukh Hiran murder case controversy, which led to Waze's arrest in the case by NIA.In Nagpur, Deshmukh, after sharing the dias with Fadnavis at the inauguration of the state planning commission building on Saturday, denied these accusations, pointing out that Bombay high court had granted him bail and explicitly stated that Waze's testimony was unreliable due to his criminal background. Deshmukh also questioned Fadnavis's judgment in using Waze's claims against him. The former home minister went on to accuse Fadnavis of orchestrating the plot in retaliation to his recent expose.NCP-SP MP Supriya Sule questioned the timing of Waze's statement, with the assembly election in the state approaching, and said, ""Which Jayant Patil he is talking about we don't know... dirty politics being played out in Maharashtra. See the timing of the letter, why he is writing it now because they (the ruling party) are afraid of our senior leader, so they are now behind them.""",Former cop Sachin Waze reveals that he had named another minister from the MVA govt - Jayant Patil - in his purported missive to deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis. Waze is currently in jail in a murder case.

AYODHYA: Authorities riding bulldozers in UP's Faizabad demolished Saturday a bakery owned by Samajwadi Party functionary and rape accused Moeed Khan in Bhadarsa, 21 km southwest of Ayodhya . According to ADM Anirudh Singh, the bakery was built illegally by encroaching upon a public pond.The action followed a complaint from the family of an underage girl of SC Nishad community that she was repeatedly raped by Moeed and his employee Raju since mid-May, making her pregnant.Police have registered a case under the Pocso Act and both suspects have been arrested.Ayodhya SSP Raj Karan Nayyar said the girl's father died two years ago, leaving her mother, sisters, and herself to do menial labour to get by. According to the complaint, Raju informed her in May that Moeed wanted to see her after work. When she arrived, Moeed allegedly raped her and recorded the crime with Raju's help.

Farooq used his cover as a police personnel to act as a conduit for supplying smuggled narcotics from across the border to Srinagar, Budgam and its peripheral satellite areas. He was exposed when Rahmat Shah was arrested with around 806 grams of brown sugar on the way to Kupwara from Karnah. On investigation, Rahmat spilled the beans on associates Farooq and Khalid.Khalid, recruited as a constable in 2009, would facilitate the smooth transportation and sale of drugs. Constable Irshad Ahmad Chalkoo, also dismissed on Saturday, was deployed as personal security officer (PSO) of a senior government officer in Baramulla. Over a period of time he developed a close relationship with the terrorist associates of the area and started working as an over ground worker for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Sources said Irshad got exposed in 2020 when Handwara police apprehended two terrorists from the house of one Abdul Razzaq Bhat. Search of the two terrorists yielded a huge cache of illegal arms and ammunition. On disclosures by the two terrorists, Irshad was arrested along with four more LeT terror associates. It was found that Irshad was in close contact with two Kashmir-origin terrorists based in PoJK and had received arms/ammunition, which he was supposed to deliver to the terrorists of LeT, for a payment of Rs 1 lakh.Dismissed teacher Nazam Din from Poonch, despite being a govt employee,joined and promoted a few organisations and crypto-currency applications. ""Nazam Din and his associate Qamar Din, an OGW for Hizbul Mujahideen, used to meet very frequently and during one such meeting, Nazam received Rs 10 lakh from Qamar Din, all derived from these illegal proceeds of narco-terror. These proceeds were ingeniously funneled and invested via one Rizwan Sheikh in spice business with the ultimate aim of making the terrorist-secessionist ecosystem a self-financing and self-sustaining campaign,"" sources told TOI.Nazam Din eventually became key handler of narco-terror network run by PoJK based terrorists Mohd Bashir alias Tikka Khan and Mohd Latief. In September 2022 Mohd Bashir and Mohd Latief (both J&K origin terrorists based in PoJK) sent a huge consignment of narcotics consisting of 15 kg of heroin from across the LoC. Of these about 5 kg was received by Nazam Din and was to be delivered to some Punjab-based drug peddlers in Poonch for a commission of Rs 2 lakh. He was about to deliver the consignment when he was arrested by the Punjab Police.Constable Saif Din, a resident of Jammu, was a notorious drug peddler, a habitual offender and a mastermind who manipulated the very system that was meant to curb his kind.",J&K LG Manoj Sinha invoked 311 (2) (c) of the Constitution of India to sack the six staffers.

10% of organ transplant recipients in India are foreigners: Government data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-of-organ-transplant-recipients-in-india-are-foreigners-government-data/articleshow/112253615.cms,"‘Foreigners mostly go for living donor transplants’

NEW DELHI: Foreigners account for nearly one in every 10 persons undergoing organ transplant in India, govt data shows. In 2023, data shared by National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation reveals, India recorded 18,378 organ transplants with 42 recipients getting more than one organ. So, there were a total 18,336 organ recipients in the country of which 1,851 (10%) were foreign nationals .Transplants involving foreign nationals were carried out in Delhi (1,445), Rajasthan (116), West Bengal (88), UP (76), Telangana (61), Maharashtra (35), Karnataka (15), Gujarat (11), Tamil Nadu (3) and Manipur (1).Doctors say a majority of such patients come from neighbouring nations where transplant facilities are not available or still in nascent stages, including Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar.While the majority of foreigners receiving organ transplants in India come from neighbouring nations, some also come from developed nations like the US and UK for living donor transplants because the cost of the procedure is barely a tenth here compared with medical costs in their countries, Dr Subhash Gupta, liver transplant surgeon and chairman of Max Centre for Liver and Biliary Sciences, said. ""Nearly 30% of patients undergoing liver transplant at our centre are foreigners,"" he added.An organ transplant involves removing an organ from a donor - living or deceased - and transplanting it into a needy patient.The person who gives the organ is called the donor. The person who receives the organ is called the recipient. A living donor can donate kidney (as one kidney is capable of maintaining the body functions), a portion of pancreas (as half of the pancreas is adequate for sustaining pancreatic functions) and part of the liver (as the few segments that are donated will regenerate after a period of time). On the other hand, a deceased donor or person who is declared brain dead can donate multiple organs and tissues including the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, intestines and corneas.Pallavi Kumar of Mohan Foundation, an NGO working in the field of organ donation, said deceased donations are rare in India and preference is given to Indians for receiving organs retrieved from such donors. ""Most transplants involving foreigners are living donor transplants,"" she said.The NOTTO data also reflects this trend. It shows that of the 1,851 foreigner transplants that took place in India in 2023, only nine involved organ donation from a deceased donor.""For living donor organ transplants involving foreigners, there are strict protocols and vetting is done at multiple levels to ascertain that the donor is a blood relative of the patient before allowing transplant,"" Dr A S Soin, liver transplant surgeon and chairman of the Institute of Liver Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Medanta-The Medicity, said.Recently, there were reports of commercial dealings in organ transplants involving foreign citizens after which the Centre issued a directive asking states/UTs to create a NOTTO (National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation)-ID of all organ recipients, both for living and deceased donor-related organ transplants.","In 2023, India recorded 18,378 organ transplants with 42 recipients getting more than one organ.

He said agriculture is the core of the country's economic policy and small farmers are the biggest strength of India's food security.Addressing the 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE), Modi said India, being a food surplus country today, is committed to global welfare as a 'Vishwa Bandhu', noting that the country's vision for global welfare was put forward on various fora including 'One Earth, One Family and One Future' (at G20), 'Mission LiFE', and 'One Earth, One Health'.The theme for this year's ICAE is ""Transformation Towards Sustainable Agri-Food Systems"" to promote sustainable agriculture in the face of global challenges such as climate change, natural resource degradation, rising production costs and conflicts.

His visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to conservation have left an enduring legacy.Dutta, a gold medallist in Zoology from Nagpur Science College and an alumnus of FRI Dehradun, retired as PCCF in 1984. Known for his exceptional knowledge and passion, he was a mentor to countless forest officers.Chief minister Dr Mohan Yadav expressed deep sorrow over Dutta’s demise, calling him a stalwart of Indian forestry . The government of Madhya Pradesh conferred him the Lifetime Achievement Award for his extraordinary contribution to the conservation of wildlife in the state and the country.For his vision and perseverance in building a strong wildlife wing with a dedicated and trained workforce and creating a network of rich and diverse protected areas in various biogeographical zones of the state, and for his scientific temper that led to the establishment of the State Forest Research Institute at Jabalpur, Dutta’s contributions are unparalleled.His strategy, which called for a change of role for the wildlife manager from a conservation introvert to a friend of the people, was circulated by the Government of India for adoption by other states. He became a radiant centre of expertise while serving on the Faculty Selection Committee of the Wildlife Institute of India for over a decade, first as a member and finally as its chairman. Even after his retirement, he continued to be a source of guidance and inspiration to the younger generation of foresters.“Owing to his untiring efforts to secure and nurture wildlife, Madhya Pradesh virtually became the ‘ Tiger State ’ of India by claiming 450 out of a total census of about 1800 in the first countrywide tiger estimation,” wrote Ghanshaym Saxena and Suhas Kumar, retired IFS officers.“His ability to train and influence the young foresters and field personnel resulted in a cadre of an extremely adept and dedicated workforce that led Madhya Pradesh to become a leader in wildlife management in the entire country. Some of the reserves developed under his guidance in MP had brought international recognition to the state and the country. His protégé Padam Bhushan H S Pawar headed Project Tiger in the early 1980s and later as the director of Wildlife Institute of India, a prestigious institution of the Government of India.

'Mamata Banerjee monitoring the situation'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal minister Akhil Giri has come under scrutiny after a video surfaced showing him threatening and verbally abusing Moumita Sahu, a woman official from the state forest department . The incident took place on Saturday in Purba Medinipur district following the removal of illegal encroachments from forest land near Tajpur sea beach.In the footage, Giri can be heard making menacing remarks toward Sahu and her team, including threats of severe consequences if she continued to be involved in the matter.""Don’t talk too much. You are a government employee; bow down your head while speaking. See what happens to you within a week. If you involve yourself in this issue again, I will make sure you can’t return,"" Giri said.The forest department removed several illegal shops from the forest land near Tajpur beach on Friday night. These establishments were reportedly submerged during high tides. A senior forest department official told news agency PTI that while many constructions on forest land had gone unchecked, action was taken against these specific shops due to their location.Giri criticised the forest department’s actions, telling PTI, ""The forest department removed shops and is now disrupting the lives of poor people. Many constructions on forest land have not been addressed before.""The Bharatiya Janata Party also shared the video on X and challenged Mamata Banerjee to take action. The party questioned whether the accused would face consequences for his alleged threats and misconduct towards a woman.""Will Mamata Banerjee dare to throw out this Minister and put him behind the bars? Will charges be filed against him for obstructing government workers and outraging the modesty of women? Let's see if this goon is kicked inside the jail for threatening to indirectly kill and outrage the modesty of a woman,"" West Bengal BJP said in a post on X.Trinamool Congress spokesperson Kunal Ghosh condemned Giri’s actions. “We oppose Giri’s words and behavior. It is unacceptable. If he had concerns about the forest department, he should have addressed them through Birbaha Hansda. The mistreatment of the woman officer is unfortunate, and our party does not endorse such behavior. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee are monitoring the situation,” Ghosh said.This incident is not Giri’s first controversy. In 2022, he faced criticism for making racist comments about President Droupadi Murmu during a rally in Nandigram.""We don't judge anyone by their appearance, we respect the office of the President (of India). But how does our President look?"" he had said.",West Bengal minister Akhil Giri has come under scrutiny after a video surfaced showing him threatening and verbally abusing a woman official.
