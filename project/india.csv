Amit Shah to launch 'Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag' for instant regional language translation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-to-launch-bharatiya-bhasha-anubhag-for-instant-regional-language-translation/articleshow/113339408.cms,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah will launch the ‘ Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag ', a special initiative of the department of official language under the ministry of home affairs, at the 4th Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan here on Saturday, enabling instant translation of official communication between the Centre and the states, from Hindi or English to regional language of the relevant state and vice versa.“Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches in (non-Hindi speaking) states get instantly translated and can be heard by the public in their respective regional language, the ‘Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag’, in collaboration with Centre for Deployment of Advanced Computing ( C-DAC ), will put in place a universal translation system for official communication. For instance, if the chief minister of Tamil Nadu writes a letter to the Centre in Tamil, the Union minister here can read it in his language and have the reply sent in Tamil. This will help bring the regional languages on to the centre-stage,” secretary in department of official language Anshuli Arya told a press conference here on Friday.Arya added that the recommendations of the parliamentary committee on official language — contained in 12 reports, three of which are pending with the President of India — will, as per the procedure, be forwarded to the ministries concerned and after their comments are received, a considered decision will be taken on the way forward. She said all the recommendations are designed to uphold India’s composite culture and lay emphasis on adopting a persuasive or motivational approach, rather than a punitive approach, towards promoting the official language. It was with this spirit that the department of personnel and training (DoPT) had turned down the parliamentary panel’s recommendation to record adverse comments in annual confidential report (ACR) of officers who failed to meet targets for official communication in Hindi, informed Arya.Shah, who will address the inaugural session of official language’s diamond jubilee celebrations and 4th Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan here on Friday, will also launch the diamond jubilee special issue of 'Rajbhasha Bharti' magazine, besides releasing a commemorative postage stamp and coin, said a home ministry release.He will present the 'Rajbhasha Gaurav' and 'Rajbhasha Kirti' awards on the occasion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been constantly emphasising on the development of Hindi and Indian languages and better coordination between them, the MHA release said.The home minister had conceptualised organising Hindi Diwas on a large scale in various cities in 2019. Varanasi had hosted Hindi Diwas and the first Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan in 2021, followed by Surat in 2022 and Pune in 2023.During the two-day conference starting here on Saturday, an in-depth discussion will be held on the progress of Hindi as an official language, public language and contact language in the last 75 years. Additionally, there will be discussion on 'India's cultural heritage and Hindi' and a session on three newly launched criminal laws -- Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023.","The ‘Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag’, in collaboration with Centre for Deployment of Advanced Computing ( C-DAC ), will put in place a universal translation system for official communication.

"Satellite-based toll system to have factory-fitted unit, phased launch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-based-toll-system-to-have-factory-fitted-unit-phased-launch/articleshow/113335203.cms,"Satellites will track distance

Using pre-installed device

And virtual toll booths

With dedicated lanes at first

That will start with trucks

The govt this week set the ball rolling for toll collection based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coupled with on-board units (OBUs) installed in vehicles. The new system, once fully operational across highways , will ensure nonstop travel and remove the need for physical toll plazas or toll gates. The full rollout will need a couple of years, but the system promises a better experience during highway travel.Here's how it will work:The key highlight of the new toll system is that a satellite or constellation of satellites will track the movement of vehicles and calculate the toll or user fee based on the exact distance travelled. That means vehicles will no longer have to stop at barriers for the electronic deduction of toll. The road transport and highways ministry amended the NH Fee Rules to allow toll collection using the GNSS-OBU system earlier this week. Officials said the toll system will use NavIC, India's satellite-based navigation system.Each vehicle will need to be fitted with a non-transferable GNSS-OBU unit. This unit, which works as a tracking device, can either be installed externally (retrofitted) or come installed from the factory. This unit will communicate digitally with a 'centralised/zonal toll charger' software that will be installed along designated highway stretches. This 'toll charger' will receive inputs regarding distance and time travelled from the OBU fitted in vehicles. These OBUs will be onboarded with the 'toll charger' by fintech companies, which will serve as the ""issuer entity"", just like there are issuer banks under the FASTag system.The installation of OBUs will be checked at the time of registration, re-registration and fitness test.Tracking of the entry and exit of vehicles will be done using virtual gantries (a kind of signal infrastructure) that are to be installed along the tolled highway network. These will communicate with GNSS-enabled vehicles. These gantries will thus serve as a virtual toll booth that will gather information such as vehicle registration number, type, and bank account details. When the GNSS-OBU vehicle passes through this virtual toll booth, the system will automatically deduct the user fee from the user's account using the existing FASTag ecosystem for payment.User fee will be calculated real-time whenever a vehicle crosses the designated length of toll plazas, makes a U-turn, and leaves the GNSS stretch. The user will get an SMS of the toll deducted on every occasion. The 'toll charger' will calculate the user fee based on toll parameters defined by NHAI such as type of structure, that is, bypass, expressway, or flyover, etc.To begin with, the existing toll plazas will have dedicated 'GNSS lanes' where the barrier gates will normally stay open to allow uninterrupted passage of vehicles fitted with GNSS-OBUs. These lanes will have the advanced readers to track such vehicles while allowing them to zip through without stopping. Subsequently, more lanes will be brought under this system.NHAI will bring out the bid document in the next two months and the target is to make the first stretch under commercial satellite-based tolling operational by April-June 2025.Indian and global technology majors, including TCS, Infosys, Accenture, RailTel, TCIL, Sky Toll, Kapsch, BEMobile and Movyon, have expressed interest and submitted applications to develop the system for GNSS-based tolling.GNSS-based tolling will start with trucks, buses and vehicles carrying dangerous goods since these already feature the Vehicle Location Tracking (VLT) system and don't involve privacy issues. Other commercial vehicles will be the next segment to be onboarded. Private vehicles will be brought under GNSS tracking as part of the last stage in 2026-27.The highway-owning agencies of Central govt have completed the geo-fencing of almost the entire length of national highways. Geo-fencing is crucial for marking the exact entry and exit points for toll calculation. The GNSS tolling agency will do geo-referencing of highways before commencing GNSS-based tolling. The total length of national highways in India is around 1.4 lakh km with user fee being collected on approximately 45,000km.Initially, GNSS-based tolling will be rolled out on 2,000km of national highways by June 2025. It will be extended to 10,000km in nine months, 25,000km in 15 months, and 50,000km in two years.","The new system will ensure nonstop travel and remove the need for physical toll plazas or toll gates. The full rollout will need a couple of years, but the system promises a better experience during highway travel. Each vehicle will need to be fitted with a non-transferable GNSS-OBU unit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113337896,imgsize-1609886,width-400,resizemode-4/113337896.jpg"

The perception stuck and came back to haunt the premier investigating agency when Justice Ujjal Bhuyan used the expression to question the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal It was the then CJI, R M Lodha, who coined the term while hearing the coal scam case during UPA govt and pulled up the agency for working under the Centre's influence.Questioning CBI's motive and timing in arresting Kejriwal immediately after he was granted bail in the ED case, Justice Bhuyan said, ""When CBI did not feel the necessity to arrest the appellant for 22 long months, I fail to understand the great hurry and urgency on its part to arrest the appellant when he was on the cusp of release in the ED case.""He further said, ""CBI is the premier investigating agency of the country. It is in public interest that CBI must not only be above board but must also be seen to be so. Rule of law, which is a basic feature of our constitutional republic, mandates that investigation must be fair, transparent and judicious. This court has time and again emphasised that fair investigation is a fundamental right of an accused person under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution. Investigation must not only be fair but must be seen to be so. Every effort must be made to remove any perception that investigation was not carried out fairly and that the arrest was made in a high-handed and biased manner.""Justice Bhuyan added, ""In a functional democracy governed by the rule of law, perception matters. Like Caesar's wife, an investigating agency must be above board. Not so long ago, this court had castigated CBI, comparing it to a caged parrot. It is imperative that CBI dispel the notion of it being a caged parrot. Rather, the perception should be that of an uncaged parrot."" He also emphasised that power to arrest should be used by probe agencies sparingly and an accused could not be arrested for being evasive in his response to a query.""The respondent is definitely wrong when it says that because the appellant was evasive in his reply, because he was not cooperating with the probe, therefore, he was rightly arrested and now should be continued in detention. It cannot be the proposition that only when an accused answers the questions put to him by the investigation agency in the manner in which the investigating agency would like the accused to answer, would mean that the accused is cooperating with the investigation. Further, the respondent can't justify arrest and continued detention citing evasive reply,"" Justice Bhuyan said.The judge said an accused has the right to remain silent and he cannot be compelled to make inculpatory statements against himself. ""This court, while emphasising the need to sensitise police against high-handed arrest, deprecated the attitude to arrest first and then to proceed with the rest...While emphasising that police officers should not arrest the accused unnecessarily and that the magistrate should not authorise detention casually and mechanically... The exercise of the power of arrest must be pursued sparingly. This court reiterated the role of the courts in protecting personal liberty and ensuring that investigations are not used as a tool of harassment,"" he added.","Justice Ujjal Bhuyan used the expression to question the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

Braving rain, the demonstrators carried placards with eight-point demands, including punishment to the attackers through a fast-track tribunal. The protests came two days after chief adviser Muhammad Yunus told the nation in a televised speech that no one should do anything to hurt religious harmony .In Chattogram, Hindus demanded a separate ministry to deal with minority affairs, reserved seats for minorities, and asked the coordinators of the students' protests to sit with them, giving them 15 days to act. The protests had culminated in the Hasina-led govt's fall and her flight to India.The Hindu demonstrators said they would not return to their homes until their demands were met, including compensation and rehabilitation of those affected. Referring to targeted killings, looting and destruction of their properties, they also demanded a separate minority protection act. They asserted they were not acting as anyone's ""agent"", a label they alleged was often foisted on minorities whenever they spoke up for their rights.In Chattogram, protesters, including women, gathered in Jamal Khan area and demonstrated from 3pm. Describing themselves as ""Bangali (Bangladesh natives)"", they declared they will not leave this land.Some demonstrators expressed displeasure over the media role as their voices are not heard via mainstream media outlets. One of them urged the authorities to take note reports of daily Prothom Alo about the attacks on minorities.In Dhaka, protesters besieged the landmark Shahbag intersection with similar demands around 4.30pm, halting traffic. Watched by security forces, the programme was held under the banner of Sanatani Odhikar Andolan, which consists of many Hindu organisations.Meanwhile, Paris-based human rights organisation Justice Makers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the recent wave of attacks targeting against minorities.

He was also told about the chemicals, also known as truth serum , like sodium pentothal, scopolamine and sodium amytal which are used in the test.Since CBI found inconsistencies in his statements, it decided to ask for narco-analysis, as it makes a person enter the hypnotic stage and become less inhibited. In this stage, the person is more likely to divulge information, which would usually not be revealed in conscious state.After Roy came out of the magistrate's chamber, the judge emerged with a sealed envelope and opened it in front of the lawyers inside the courtroom.

The 22-year-old was accompanied by three other young men from Karnataka - all deceived by a fraudulent agent and slyly drafted into a private Russian army to fight Ukraine.According to them, at least 60 Indian youth fell prey to this job fraud , with many among them still languishing in foreign land. They were all shipped out of India in Dec 2023, with a promise to get them work either as security personnel or helpers in Russia.But life took a turn for the worse once they landed in Russia. ""We were treated like slaves,"" Narayanpet's Sufiyan told TOI soon after landing in Hyderabad a little past noon on Friday.The young man recalled his harrowing past few months. ""We were woken up at 6 am every day and made to work 15 hours straight - with no rest or sleep. The conditions were inhuman. We were given meagre ration. Our hands were blistered, our backs ached and our spirits were broken. Yet, if we showed any signs of exhaustion, bullets were fired at us to force us back into the laborious tasks,"" Sufiyan added, his voice trembling.Their assignments were no mean jobs. They had to dig trenches and fire assault rifles. They were also trained to fire Kalashnikovs such as the AK-12 and AK-74, along with hand grenades and other explosives.But the toughest challenge was to stay disconnected from the rest of the world. Sufiyan and his companions recalled how they never knew with certainty where they were - or were being taken to - and were not allowed to communicate with their families back in India.""Our mobile phones were seized. For months during the training, I could not talk to my family,"" said Abdul Nayeem from Karnataka, fighting back tears.The psychological toll of living in an alien war zone was immense on the men. Syed Ilias Hussaini, a resident of Kalaburagi in Karnataka, described the constant fear of being caught in the crossfire and the unrelenting pressure to perform under life-threatening circumstances. ""Every day we woke up not knowing if it would be our last. The sound of gunfire and explosions became a constant backdrop to our lives, and we lived in perpetual fear,"" Ilias said, his eyes welling up.The only way to cope, the men said, was to pray and imagine a day when they would set foot back in India and reunite with their families. ""We longed for the comfort of our families and the safety of our homes. The thought of never seeing them again haunted us every day,"" Sufiyan said, tightly holding onto his brother Mohammad Salman who, along with his father, mother and others, were at the airport to receive him.The sight of other ""soldiers"" dropping dead only added to their trauma. ""Hamil, a very good friend of mine from Gujarat, was blown to death in a drone attack. He was part of a team of 24 soldiers, including one Indian and one Nepali. It shook me up,"" recalled Sufiyan. He added: ""It was only after Hamil's death that we told our families about our situation, who then requested Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to rescue us from the warzone. I am glad to be able to see this day.""","Mohammad Sufiyan, 22, returned home to Hyderabad on Friday. Video of him pleading to be rescued from the war-hit Russia-Ukraine border surfaced.
