The builder’s wife, too emotionally requested him to own up the responsibility of the accident.

The family members gave him different enticements for owning up the responsibility.

After the accident, the minor, his friends and the driver were taken to the police station. Initially, the driver went on claiming that he was behind the wheel. The police did not believe in him and registered the case against the minor, according to Pune police.

The driver was forced to sit in a room and his phone was confiscated by them. No one was allowed to meet him.

The next day, the driver’s wife went to the builder’s bungalow searching for her husband. But she was not allowed to meet him. The builder’s family members made many ‘promises’ to her and requested her to cajole her husband to own up the responsibility of the accident after she created a scene there.

Later in the day, the driver was allowed to return home with a warning. Following this, he was ‘underground’ for two days and resurfaced on Thursday. When we took him to the crime branch for questioning on Thursday, things unfolded on this aspect of the case.

During this time, cyclone Remal is expected to bring maximum wind speeds ranging from 110 to 120 kilometres per hour, posing potential risks to the affected areas.India has taken precautionary measures, deploying its disaster relief force in West Bengal. Flights have been suspended at Kolkata, a major metropolitan city in the state. Some parts of West Bengal are already experiencing moderate rainfall.The Indian Navy said that it has ""kept ships, aircraft, divers and medical supplies on standby for deployment if required."" The low-lying coastal regions of Bangladesh and India have been hit by severe storms in recent years, with Cyclone Yaas in 2021 leaving more than 50,000 people homeless and causing at least one fatality.In Bangladesh, the weather office has raised its storm danger signal to the highest level for two ports and nine coastal districts. Warnings are being announced over loudspeakers, and evacuations have begun in coastal areas. State minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman, informed Reuters that ""Bangladesh has set up nearly 8,000 cyclone shelters and mobilised 78,000 volunteers.""Severe cyclonic storm 'Remal' has intensified and the landfall process has begun.

He added that holding elections simultaneously will also reduce costs.Regarding the possibility of shifting elections to a different time of the year, such as winter, instead of the current practice of holding them during the scorching heat, Shah said, ""We can think over it.

Over time, the election (Lok Sabha) gradually moved to this period (during summer).""Speaking about the UCC, the Union home minister emphasized that it is a responsibility left to the government, Parliament, and state legislatures by the makers of the Constitution since independence.

Adani’s Mundra Port welcomes largest ever container ship to dock in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adanis-mundra-port-welcomes-largest-ever-container-ship-to-dock-in-india/articleshow/110443007.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adani Group ’s Mundra Port on Sunday saw the largest ever container ship to dock at an Indian port when the almost 400-metre-long MSC Anna came visiting. This vessel is a metre longer than the earlier biggest one — MV MSC Hamburg — that docked here last July.

“MSC Anna is an impressive vessel, boasting an overall length of 399.98 m (roughly the length of four football fields) and a staggering capacity of 19,200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), which makes it the largest container ship by capacity to ever visit an Indian port. Its arrival draft is 16.3 m, which can be accommodated only at Adani Ports, Mundra, as no other port in India is capable of berthing a deep-draft vessel. During its stay, the expected exchange is 12,500 TEUs,” Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said in a statement.

Last July 2023, Adani Ports, Mundra, had berthed the 399-metre-long MV MSC Hamburg, one of the longest container ships in the world, with a capacity of 16,652 TEUs. This had set the stage for the arrival of MSC Anna.

“The arrival of MSC Anna at Mundra not only highlights the port’s capacity to handle mega ships but also reflects its role in enhancing India’s maritime trade capabilities. As APSEZ continues to expand and upgrade its facilities, the port is set to play an increasingly significant role in the global shipping and logistics landscape,” the statement added.

The arrest comes after a prominent city-based builder, Satinder Singh Sawhney, 52, named the two in a suicide note which he penned before he ended his life by jumping off the terrace of a seven-floor apartment complex on Friday morning.Originally hailing from Saharanpur, the Gupta family had gained notoriety for their extensive business ventures in South Africa where they were accused of large-scale corruption. A few years ago, the family's involvement in a significant political scandal in the country, involving president Jacob Zuma, had made headlines across the globe. The family had also stirred controversy by hosting the weddings of two of their children in the environmentally-fragile meadows of Auli in the Garhwal Himalayas in 2019. The big ticket weddings, said to have cost Rs 200 cr, left behind a trail of garbage in the eco-sensitive area, leading to widespread criticism of the festivities.Following the controversy in South Africa, the family came to India and reconnected with their roots in Saharanpur.The dead builder's suicide note, addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, accused the brothers of ""coercion and interference in his projects.""Police sources said Sawhney had accused Anil and Ajay of “threatening him and his business partner to hand over two major construction projects in the city”. These allegations were reiterated in both the suicide note recovered by authorities and a formal complaint lodged by Sawhney's son, Ranbir.""My father was under immense stress as the UP police demanded his presence regarding a false case lodged by the Guptas in Saharanpur. However, due to the tension, he refrained from going there. The police then set a deadline of Friday for his appearance.

They vowed to create circumstances compelling enough for him to take his own life, which tragically occurred on Friday morning,"" Ranbir said in the complaint.In his suicide note, Sawhney said that he and his business partner, Sanjay Garg, undertook two projects in the city based on their market reputation. “However, we lacked sufficient funds to sustain such large projects managed by our companies, Sawhney Structure LLP and Sawhney Infra LLP. A mutual friend, Baljeet Singh Soni, introduced us to Anil Gupta as Anil was seeking investment opportunities. Following our meeting, Anil agreed to invest 85% of the total project funds as a silent partner, with the promise of minimal interference in the projects’ operations,” the note read.Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh confirmed the detention and subsequent arrest of the Guptas from their residence in Dalanwala area of Dehradun.

However, the turnout for Phase 6 is still way lower than the polling in first four phases.Polling data officially shared by the Election Commission at 11.45 pm on Saturday had put the Phase 6 turnout at 61.2%. It has since been constantly updated via the EC's voter turnout app as more polling parties returned and submitted their reports, resulting in a 2.2 percentage points jump over the polling day figure. Also, the Phase 6 turnout is now 1.2 percentage points higher than Phase 5 polling, notwithstanding the high temperatures recorded in many of the constituencies that went to polls on Saturday.The turnout data for Phase 6, as available on the EC app at 10 pm on Sunday, is almost final as no repolls were scheduled after scrutiny held on Sunday in the presence of candidates or their agents, sources told TOI. However, the current turnout figures for all the phases are based on EVM votes and do not factor in postal ballots since the latter are counted only on results day.The overall turnout in NCT of Delhi stood revised to 58.7 per cent on Sunday evening from 57.7 per cent at 11.45 pm on Saturday. This is, however, still lower than the 60.6 per cent turnout recorded in 2019. All the seven parliamentary constituencies in Delhi too have clocked lower turnouts as compared to the last Lok Sabha election.As per data available on the voter turnout app on Sunday evening, North East Delhi parliamentary constituency witnessed the highest polling in the state at 62.8%. Like 2019, New Delhi clocked the lowest turnout at 55.4%, followed by South Delhi at 56.4%. The polling percentage on Sunday evening was 57.8 per cent in North West Delhi, 58.6 per cent in Chandni Chowk, 58.8 per cent in West Delhi and 59.5 per cent in East Delhi.Statewise turnouts, as updated in the voter turnout app by Sunday evening, show the biggest rise of 4.9 percentage points in Odisha , up from 69.6 per cent at Saturday 11.45 pm to 74.5 per cent on Sunday evening. Also, there was a climb of 4.4 percentage points in Haryana, up from 60.4 per cent at Saturday 11.45 pm to 64.8 per cent on Sunday evening. The uptick was also significant in Odisha; the revised turnout was 4.1 percentage points higher that the 69.6 per cent polling declared by EC towards the end of polling day.West Bengal saw a 3.2 percentage point jump from 79.5 per cent to 82.7%, possibly due to polling parties having taken time to return from the remote polling stations. The rise in turnout in Jharkhand was around 1.6 percentage points, in Bihar 1.9 percentage points, in J&K 0.5 percentage points and in Delhi, 1 percentage points.The turnout figure for UP was almost the same as Saturday.The Commission had on Saturday said it will publish the updated voter turnout figures for Phase 6 by May 30.Turnouts - which are presently based on EVM votes and do not include postal ballots which are counted only on results day - have fluctuated through the phases, with Phase 4 having recorded the highest polling at 69.2%, followed by 66.7 per cent in Phase, 66.1 per cent in Phase and 65.7 per cent in Phase 3.

AAP is a bunch of propagandists who believe in Goebbels' principles: J P Nadda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-is-a-bunch-of-propagandists-who-believe-in-goebbels-principles-j-p-nadda/articleshow/110445574.cms,"Confident of significant gains in states like West Bengal, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh while equally sure of retaining dominance in north and central India,

president J P Nadda tells TOI’s Akhilesh Singh his party is set to retain office with a thumping majority. Excerpts:

Just one phase of polling remains. What is your assessment of BJP and

NDA

's performance?

Which factors do you think are working for BJP?

Reports suggest that BJP is not improving its performance in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and its struggle for a foothold in the two states continues.

What is your reaction to

AAP

's allegation that their Rajya Sabha MP,

Swati Maliwal

, is a 'BJP agent'?

You sound confident that NDA will win 400 seats but reports suggest that BJP is not doing too well in Uttar Pradesh despite there being no SP-BSP alliance like 2019. Moreover, construction of Ram temple has taken place but it seems a sweep by BJP is far-fetched.

Maharashtra and Karnataka played a big role in helping BJP cross 300 seats in 2019. But the political situation in both states has changed.

Similar reports are coming from Rajasthan as well.

Your tenure as BJP president has witnessed induction of outsiders. Don't you think there will be a clash of ambitions and interests and that may translate into disappointment among the old party members?

BJP won 303 seats in 2019 but your target is to win 370 this time, which states do you think the party is improving?

There is discussion that RSS has not been very active in the ongoing polls?

See, BJP on its own has already crossed the majority mark... some guesstimates suggest the party has won 310 seats after five phases. After seven phases, our party is poised to cross 370 seats and NDA will cross 400. The mood across the country is very positive for the BJP-led alliance. Voters trust Narendra Modi and they are voting for BJP to make him PM again. There is no ambiguity among them, which makes us confident of winning with a bigger margin. Even opposition parties have started acknowledging that BJP is winning and they are sounding distressed. Their tone changed from the third phase onwards as they realised that there is a wave for BJP and PM Modi .Modi ji's leadership has been the key factor There is a general feeling, I think unanimity, across the country that PM Modi has brought about a paradigm change across the social spectrum, including the political culture of the country... politics of report card, politics of accountability, performance, last-mile delivery, saturating implementation of social welfare schemes. There is unflinching trust in PM Modi's leadership among diverse sections. Be it educated or semi-educated, urban or rural resident, they have all been beneficiaries and the way global perception about the image of the country has changed has resulted in optimism and enthusiasm. Before 2014, there was indifference towards governance and political leadership of the country. PM Modi changed that. Let me give you a few examples. We entered the poll fray in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in a big way and our candidates had to face entrenched regional players like AIADMK and DMK in TN and the two alliances (LDF, UDF) in Kerala. However, thanks to the Modi factor, we are expecting seats from these states also. If you look at the popularity chart, PM Modi has trumped and there is hardly anyone raising questions about his leadership. Ease of living, and empowerment of women, poor, farmers and youth created a pro-Modi wave. Besides, people are feeling proud about the focus on cultural heritage as we have a slogan 'Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi', which underlines our aim to move on with the times and yet remember our legacy.I have no idea about your source of information but let me tell you that our party is going to win seats Tamil Nadu and it could happen in Kerala too. We may not win too many seats but BJP's vote is set to increase significantly. Modi's popularity was seen in both states but translating that popularity into electoral wins takes time as you need a strong local organisation and winnable candidates. However, we are going to break the myth about TN and Kerala being alien territory for us and our footprint there is going to only expand.See, AAP leaders, and I say with full responsibility, are urban Naxals in disguise. And in a way, their style of functioning is to create disorder in society. Therefore, spreading lies and falsehoods come easily to them. They had pledged not to join politics, they floated a political outfit, they ruled out alliance with Congress but they are now allies. They claim to be anti-corruption but have been proven to be, despite being a young outfit, the most corrupt. They assured respect for women, look at the way they have behaved (Maliwal's assault). There is a huge gap between what they say and what they do. The liquor scam and assault on a woman MP have exposed them. Swati Maliwal's case has exposed Arvind Kejriwal personally, his true face is now there for people to see. This is their way of functioning that they first commit sin (paap) and then make wild allegations to divert attention. They believe in anarchy. They have no ideology... their only ideology is to grab power and hold it at all costs. When they are caught red-handed, then their conduct gets more outrageous. Maliwal is Kejriwal's party MP, the incident happened in his house, and they released the video, his party MP made the allegations and lodged an FIR and they have to call her a BJP agent. AAP leaders are propagandists, who believe in Goebbels' principles.Ram temple is an issue of faith for us and not a political issue, we have maintained it for years and still feel so. If you remember, the alliance of the two caste-based parties (SP and BSP) in 2019 was said to be formidable and it was believed BJP won't repeat its success of 2014. However, political pundits were proven wrong and BJP won 62 seats and the alliance's tally was 62. Again, there has been an attempt to set the poll narrative on caste and communal lines. However, the groundswell is so different from the reports you are talking about. There is a one-way wave in favour of BJP and people have made up their minds to make BJP the winner againThere'll not be much of a difference in the two states. BJP will achieve 90% of its targets.There is no denying that an attempt in Rajasthan was made to divide voters on caste lines and I can say that the opposition succeeded in a few seats. I agree that there are tough contests in a few seats but I don't see significant damage happening there.We focus on three important factors. First, BJP is an ideology-based party, second we are cadre-based and third we have a mass following. We don't accept all but we follow a long process of due diligence and assess them on the three parameters. We assess what strength is added, our old cadres are not disturbed and our ideology is not compromised. Our party is a big family, and we ensure a balance to safeguard the interests of the party cadre and accommodating a newcomer. You haven't heard of any protest against anyone joining the party. We manage it. We also take cadres into confidence. There might be reservations in a few quarters but our internal democracy and structure are so inclusive that anyone joining the party feels the comfort.West Bengal is for sure, look at the way Mamata Banerjee is behaving. She is set to be wiped out. I won't be surprised if BJP wins 18 seats in Odisha. We are headed for double-digit figures in Telangana and doing well in Andhra Pradesh with our allies. North-east and north India will be intact.Not at all. RSS is a social organisation and not a political outfit. You can't expect it to work like a political organisation, it won't be acceptable for its leadership also. But we have a common ideological bond and we work for the same ideological goals. We have always received RSS support in our endeavours and they have been helpful this time too.","J P Nadda tells TOI’s Akhilesh Singh his party is set to retain office with a thumping majority.

"For Kapadia, before her triumph at Cannes was trouble at FTII",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-kapadia-before-her-triumph-at-cannes-was-trouble-at-ftii/articleshow/110445350.cms,"Nine years are all it took for FTII graduate Payal Kapadia to go from ""anti-national"" to toast of the nation. The young filmmaker , whose 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday, was a student at the country's cradle of cinema and TV when she braved chants of ""go to Pakistan"" for participating in a 139-day protest in 2015 against the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairperson.She, along with 34 other former students, continue to wage a legal battle over a case filed by the then institute's director, Prashant Pathrabe, alleging their involvement in gheraoing him and vandalising his office that year.But a day after conquering Cannes, there was not a trace of rancour in Payal's words. All she reflected was the afterglow of an unprecedented triumph that she gracefully shared with fellow filmmakers from India.""It's a great feeling to receive this prize because there are so many good films from India alongside ours, and we feel a part of the larger family of filmmakers. We have three films from FTII directors this time. My FTII batchmate Maisam Ali's film 'In Retreat' is the first Indian entry to Cannes' ACID sidebar (Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema),"" she told TOI from the French Riviera.Payal’s film on 2015 FTII stir had also won Cannes laurelAlso, an FTII student’s (Chidananda Naik) film, titled ‘Sunflowers Were the First to Know’, won the main prize in La Cinef section. It’s fantastic for us and FTII.” Payal’s batchmates and other alumni recall that the 2015 protest was “against the appointment of people who had no achievement in filmmaking” but were allegedly included in FTII’s governing council for political reasons.Harishankar Nachimuthu, ex-president of FTII Students’ Association and spearhead of the agitation, said Payal always had a vision about where she wanted to go and was willing to fight it out. “She was denied a scholarship and a foreign exchange opportunity for participating in the four-month protest. But even she would agree that FTII made us better filmmakers, better human beings, and responsible citizens,” he said.Payal credited her teachers and students at FTII for her success, saying that while not everyone needed to go to a film school, the institute benefited her with a structure that facilitates the dissemination of different cinematic ideas. “It is also a great place to meet people who share a love for cinema. My batchmates were instrumental in shaping my ideas. At FTII, we got to see films from all over the world and this exposure helped me make my film.”Payal’s peers and seniors see her as a film aficionado perpetually behind the camera, documenting various subjects, and relentlessly pursuing any project she takes up to fruition.Ajayan Adat, winner of the 53rd Kerala State Film Awards for best sound design, was Payal’s senior by two years in college. He said her big qualities were patience and diligence. “She was pained by the then govt’s attitude against the students’ protest. So she took out a camera and started filming everything. She made hours of footage into a documentary titled ‘Night of Knowing Nothing’. It won the L’Oeil d’Or at Cannes in 2021.”","Payal Kapadia's 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday.

Weight loss drugs up abdominal paralysis risk: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-weight-loss-drugs-up-abdominal-paralysis-risk/articleshow/110445326.cms,"NEW DELHI: Medications like Wegovy and Ozempic , effective for rapid weight reduction, may come with the risk of uncommon yet serious side effects, including abdominal paralysis, a condition characterised by delayed stomach emptying, a new US study has suggested.Abdominal paralysis can cause unintended weight loss, malnutrition and other complications that may require medical or surgical intervention.The study, results of which has been published only in abstract form, found people who took Wegovy and Ozempic, also referred to as GLP-1 agonist drugs, were 30% more at risk of developing abdominal paralysis compared to those who did not. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), also known as GLP-1 agonists , are a class of medications used to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity.The study, presented at a medical conference - Digestive Disease Week 2024 - in Washington on Saturday, is based on an analysis of the records of more than three lakh persons with diabetes and obesity of which 1.65 lakh were prescribed GLP-1 agonists that are known to slow stomach emptying and stimulate insulin production among other things.Dr Prateek Sharma, professor of medicine at the University of Kansas, who led the study, told TOI that abdominal paralysis is a rare side-effect of these drugs but given the high usage of GLP-1 drugs, or weight-loss drugs as it is commonly referred to, it's important too warn people about it. ""These drugs are new and while the positive effects are well-established and talked about, we are yet to discover the full extent of its long-term side-effects and that's why I feel people who are taking them should be careful,"" he said.Wegovy and Ozempic are not legally available in India. However, reports suggest that these drugs are being sourced by many through the grey market at premium. Recently, a Denmark-based company called Novo Nordisk has launched 'Rybelsus' which has semaglutide - the main ingredient of Ozempic - in tablet form in India. It has been approved for diabetes management but, doctors say, the drug is also being used 'off-label' for weight loss.Wegovy and Ozempic were also initially approved for diabetes management. But when reports emerged that it could help lose 10-15% weight within a year, the US FDA allowed its limited use in people with obesity as well. Soon, the drug group took the world by storm as people, including celebrities such as Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey, said they were using it.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc, said Rybelsus is quite expensive with one month's prescription amount costing over Rs 10,000. ""Given the popularity of these drugs, it is likely that we may have easy availability of the drug in near future and that too at lesser costs which is good as these drugs have proven to be effective in managing blood sugar, reducing weight, and even in managing chronic kidney disease. But the medical community as well as the public needs to be aware of its side-effects,"" he said.According to Dr Randhir Sud, chairman of the department of digestive and hepatobiliary sciences at Medanta hospital, drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic work by slowing the stomach movement and thus reducing appetite. ""Users can feel nausea and vomiting when they start taking the drug but in most cases these side-effects are likely to subside. I haven't come across any case of abdominal paralysis yet but these are early days of its usage in India,"" he said.In the US study, Sharma and his colleagues used a large database to analyze healthcare records of over 120 million patients, focusing on those with diabetes and obesity. They compared patients taking GLP-1 drugs to a control group, matching them by demographics and health factors. Over one year, they found that 32% of GLP-1 users experienced gastrointestinal issues like nausea, GERD, and stomach paralysis . While GLP-1 users had more GI-related procedures, they had slightly fewer ER visits and hospital admissions. This suggests that while GLP-1 drugs increase GI side effects, they don't lead to more severe health crises requiring emergency care or hospitalisation, the Kansas University professor said.""We aren't saying that one shouldn't use them. But our research clearly underscores the need for medical monitoring of gastro-intestinal side-effects such as abdominal paralysis that can impact quality of life,"" he added.","Abdominal paralysis can cause unintended weight loss, malnutrition and other complications.

’s pre-2014 plan’ to ‘create’ minority institutions overnight

LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said INDIA bloc parties want to turn the country's majority community into second-class citizens and also accused them of planning to rewrite the Constitution to provide reservation on the basis of religion Sharpening the debate over Muslim quota and who wanted to change the Constitution, the PM attacked both SP and Congress at his rallies in Mirzapur and Ghosi, accusing them of promising religion-based reservation in the past. Addressing a public meeting in Mirzapur, Modi said: ""Here, first-time voters won't remember the SP's 2012 manifesto. SP clearly stated in their manifesto that just as Babasaheb gave reservation to Dalits, the same reservation will be given to Muslims. This goes against the spirit of the Constitution and Babasaheb's ideals.""""Even in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP in its manifesto announced to give reservation to Muslims. The SP had also announced that even in police and PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) 15 percent reservation will be given to Muslims,"" The PM said.Modi also raked up Congress’s “pre-2014 plan to declare schools, colleges, and universities as minority institutions”.“For this, Congress swiftly changed laws overnight and declared thousands of educational institutions as minority institutions. Previously, these institutions provided reservations to SCs, STs, OBCs, but that was completely abolished and reservations were now given to Muslims,” he said.A few days ago, the PM had on social media a video of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi campaigning in UP “10-12 years ago”, where he is purportedly heard accusing the late SP patriarch Mulayam Singh of going back on a promise to provide reservation to Muslims.In Ghosi, where he addressed another large gathering, Modi said, “Today, I have come to alert the people of Purvanchal and Ghosi about the big conspiracy of INDIA bloc.”Citing the opposition alliance’s three “big conspiracies”, he said, “First, they will change the Constitution so that reservation can be given based on religion. Second, they will end reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs. Third, they will distribute the entire reservation basket among Muslims.”Modi said a new conspiracy was being hatched to achieve their objective. “They are declaring Muslim castes as OBCs overnight. Recently, Calcutta high court rejected OBC reservations for 77 classes in West Bengal. The vote-hungry Congress and SP want to change Ambedkar’s Constitution so that their nefarious designs can’t be challenged in court.”Attacking SP & Congress again for turning down the invitation to attend the Ram temple’s consecration, the PM said their senior functionaries tried to even find fault in the construction of the shrine when nothing else worked.He said this was the same opposition that conspired to overturn the Supreme Court verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi, just like the Shah Bano case. “When I expose them, they start raising slogans about digging my grave.”He cautioned voters that INDIA bloc wanted castes like Rajbhar, Kushwaha, Gond, Kurmi, Brahmin, Rajput, Kayashtha, and Sindhi to fight among themselves and eventually get weaker. “Caste divides will benefit the alliance, which wants to divert people’s attention from actual issues.”","PM Narendra Modi said INDIA bloc parties want to turn the country's majority community into second-class citizens.

The judges directed four municipal corporations - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot - and the state govt to come up with details about the provisions of law under which their authorities allowed such gaming zones to be set up and operated. HC has granted one day's time to the lawyers of these municipal corporations to come up with replies.The bench expressed shock at news reports that TRP gaming zone in Rajkot had taken advantage of the loopholes in the Gujarat Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations (CGDCR) to pave the way for creating illegal recreational activities. The court took notice of the fact that like Rajkot, such gaming zones have mushroomed in Ahmedabad, from Sidhu Bhavan Road to SG Highway and SP Ring Road, ""which pose significant threat to public safety, especially innocent children"".On the issue of loopholes in CGDCR, HC directed the municipal corporations to show whether the gaming zones operating under their respective jurisdictions had undertaken compliance of fire safety regulations .President of Gujarat HC Advocates' Association, Brijesh Trivedi, and advocate Amit Panchal, who demanded HC's intervention in this matter, appeared before the court and drew the court's attention on how a stock of inflammable material was kept carelessly at the gaming zone in Rajkot. This led the court to say, "" Prima-facie , a man-made disaster has occurred where many lives have been lost and families have grieved today for the loss of lives in their respective families...""Advocate Panchal has sought action in this matter by filing an application in relation to a PIL which he had filed in 2020 about fire safety in hospitals. He pointed out that despite direction from HC and SC to the state govt to strictly implement the fire safety rules, this tragedy has occurred showing gross negligence on the authorities' part. HC has also directed to list the 2020 PIL along with the suo motu PIL on Monday.","Gujarat HC called the fire an ""unfortunate tragedy"" which was ""prima facie a man-made disaster"" The judges directed four municipal corporations - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot - and the state govt to come up with details about the provisions of law.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110445183,imgsize-2079096,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110445183.jpg"

This is despite govt selling subsidised ‘Bharat’ brand rice at Rs 29 a kg for months now. Though FCI is also continuing weekly e-auction of its rice stock to bulk buyers, there has been lukewarm response, indicating there may be less takers.Sources said the new research will focus on finding whether farmers are producing more common varieties of rice, which are procured by govt for food security scheme and farmers get the assured minimum support price (MSP). They added that there is a possibility of this common variety of rice being produced more. The study will also find any shift in consumption pattern of high-value non-basmati rice varieties and also their production.The FCI’s current rice stock is around four times the buffer for July 1. It holds 502 lakh tonne of rice — 320 lakh tonnes of rice stock and 180 lakh tonnes receivable from millers.

Odisha BJP candidate arrested for EVM vandalism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-bjp-candidate-arrested-for-evm-vandalism/articleshow/110445012.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Prasanta Jagadev , the 55-year-old BJP candidate from Khurda assembly constituency , was arrested on Sunday for allegedly vandalising an EVM and assaulting polling personnel in a booth during the third phase of voting in Odisha on Saturday.The two-time BJD MLA , who was earlier booked in 11 criminal cases and is known for unruly conduct, had joined the BJP on February 29, two years after the regional party had expelled him for allegedly ramming his vehicle into some BJP workers in Khurda district on March 12, 2022, leaving several injured. He was arrested 10 days later.On Saturday afternoon, Jagadev, who was waiting to cast his vote at booth number 114 in Bolagarh block under Begunia assembly constituency, allegedly lost his cool and hurled abuses at the polling staff for supposed delay in the voting process, police sources said.Police said he allegedly ransacked the booth, leading to the damage of an EVM and caused disruptions in the polling process for several minutes. Police sources said Jagadev, who left the booth after the incident, was intercepted by the police while he was travelling in a vehicle, accompanied by a prominent BJP leader, on Saturday. He was brought to Bolagarh police station for questioning.“We arrested him on Sunday on the basis of a complaint lodged by one of the polling officials on duty. Relevant sections of the IPC and Representation of People’s Act have been imposed against him,” Khurda SP Awinash Kumar said. He was sent to Khurda jail following the rejection of his bail plea.BJD leader Bhrugu Baxipatra said Jagadev’s arrest exposed the BJP’s criteria of selecting candidates. “BJP fielded many candidates who were kicked out from the BJD for promoting criminal activities,” Baxipatra said.However, senior BJP politician Jiban Sahoo claimed Jagadev was falsely implicated in the case. “Jagadev was not involved in vandalising the EVM. We will lodge a protest,” Sahoo said.Jagadev, who was elected to the assembly on a BJD ticket from Begunia assembly segment in 2014 and from Chilika in 2019, is the second candidate to have been arrested this poll season. On May 14, Siva Shankar Dash, an Independent candidate from Berhampur assembly segment, was arrested by Gosani Nuagaon police for allegedly assaulting BJP’s Berhampur MP candidate Pradeep Panigrahy after the end of voting on May 13.In a separate incident, a case has been registered against BJD’s Chhendipada MLA candidate Susanta Kumar Behera in Angul district for allegedly attacking a BJP worker near a booth on Saturday. The office of the state chief electoral officer (CEO) has sought a report from the Angul district election officer on the matter.","Prasanta Jagadev, 55, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly vandalising an EVM and assaulting polling personnel in a booth during the third phase of voting in Odisha.

Government to notify mandatory norms for speed radar & breath analyser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-notify-mandatory-norms-for-speed-radar-breath-analyser/articleshow/110444913.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move that will largely address the growing instances of commuters challenging speed violations and drunk driving challans, the government will soon notify norms mandating the verification and calibration of microwave doppler radar equipment used to measure vehicle speed and breath analyser .The legal metrology wing of the consumer affairs department has issued draft rules for speed guns and it will soon come out with the proposed norms for breath analysers. Breathalyser calibration is the process of checking and adjusting the sensor within the equipment to ensure it displays an accurate reading. A random study by Delhi-based Institute for Road Traffic Education a few years back had found that 30 out of 40 samples of breath analysers were found faulty.As per the draft norm for “radar equipment for measurement of vehicle speed”, all such equipment which will be installed after the final notification, shall be verified and stamped within one year. All radar equipment that are already installed shall be verified and stamped as and when their re-verification becomes due.“The radar shall satisfy the conditions prescribed in the rules when the results of measurement are to be used in legal proceedings,” said the draft rule. It also specifies that if a radar records the results of measurement, it will indicate the date and time of the measurement, the measured speed and the vehicle’s direction of travel.Welcoming government’s move, road traffic experts said once the rules come into effect, it will bring down the number of complaints against faulty challans for traffic rule violation.

Army chief General Manoj Pande gets a month's extension amid intense speculation on successor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-chief-general-manoj-pande-gets-a-months-extension-amid-intense-speculation-on-successor/articleshow/110444811.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a highly unusual move that could impact the line of succession in the 12-lakh strong force, the government on Sunday granted a month’s extension to Army chief General Manoj Pande just six days before his slated retirement on May 31.The inordinate delay in announcing the successor of Gen Pande, who took over as the 29th Army chief in April 2022 and turned 62 this month, had already triggered wide-spread speculation that a supersession in the military hierarchy is in the offing, amid the continuing confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh as well as the impending move to create integrated theatre commands.The extension by the PM-led appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) will add further grist to the mill since the next senior-most Army officer, vice chief Lt-Gen Upendra Dwivedi (Jammu and Kashmir Rifles), as well as the one after him, Southern Command chief Lt-Gen Ajai Kumar Singh (Gorkha Rifles), are both slated to retire on June 30.The Army, Navy and IAF chiefs can serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier, while a Lt-Gen rank officer retires at 60 unless he is approved for the four-star rank.A top government official, however, told TOI that “any speculation or controversy is unwarranted” because it had been decided that no senior post would be filled before the election process is completed.“No top-level military or civilian posting has been done in the last one month. The next Army chief was scheduled to take over on May 31, one day before the last phase of polling. Now, the next government can announce the new Army chief in mid-June, who will then take over from Gen Pande on June 30 (both Lt-Gens Dwivedi and Singh will still be in the reckoning),” the official said.The election model code of conduct, however, did not prevent the government from announcing on April 19 that Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi would take over as the new Navy chief from Admiral R Hari Kumar on April 30.While Lt-Gens Dwivedi and Singh are both from the same course, the former became the GoC-in-C of the Udhampur-based Northern Command in Feb 2022 and then the vice chief in Feb this year. Lt-Gen Singh, in turn, became the GoC-in-C of the Pune-based Southern Command in Nov 2022.The next three officers in seniority, whose names were also sent to the ACC, are Northern Command and Central Command chiefs, Lt-Gens M V Suchindra Kumar and N S Raja Subramani, and chief of integrated defence staff Lt-Gen J P Mathew.While there have been a few supersessions for the top post in the hierarchy-conscious armed forces, the only available example of an extension being granted was when Indira Gandhi extended the tenure of Gen G G Bewoor (who in turn had succeeded Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw’s also slightly extended tenure as the Army chief after the 1971 war) in 1975 to deny the post to Lt-Gen P S Bhagat.The present NDA government has also junked the long-enshrined seniority principle two times during its 10-year tenure. First, it superseded two senior Lt-Gens (Praveen Bakshi and P M Hariz) to appoint Gen Bipin Rawat as the Army chief in December 2016, who later became the first chief of defence staff before he was killed in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.Then, Admiral Karambir Singh was appointed as the Navy chief in May 2019, superseding the then Andaman Nicobar Command chief Vice Admiral Bimal Verma. Both the times the NDA government contended it had taken the decision “based on merit, not just seniority”.There have been other exceptions to the seniority principle in the past as well. Indira Gandhi, for instance, superseded Lt-Gen S K Sinha to appoint Gen A S Vaidya as the Army chief in 1983. Similarly, Air Chief Marshal S K Mehra became IAF chief by superseding Air Marshal M M Singh in 1988.“Earlier, a new Service chief was announced two months in advance. These last minute decisions are not good for the morale of the armed forces. There is also increasing politicization of the armed forces, with some top officers actively seeking out politicians to push their promotion claims,” a senior officer said.","Army chief General Manoj Pande has been granted a month's extension. The extension comes six days before his slated retirement on May 31. The next senior-most Army officer, vice chief Lt-Gen Upendra Dwivedi, is also slated to retire on June 30.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110444846,imgsize-40446,width-400,resizemode-4/110444846.jpg"

Pakistan using terrorism against India as instrument of state policy: Union minister Puri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-using-terrorism-against-india-as-instrument-of-state-policy-union-minister-puri/articleshow/110444222.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Sunday accused Pakistan of using terrorism against India as an ""instrument of state policy"" and said under the Modi government, India has sent a clear message to the neighbouring country that it will eliminate terrorists in its territory. ""Pakistan is a country which has consciously and continuously practised the use of terror as an instrument of state policy ,"" said Puri while speaking to reporters here.""Ever since Modi ji came (to power), those who were into cross-border terrorism have got a message,"" he said.Puri also held the Congress responsible for the anti-Sikh riots in 1984.It was not a riot, it was a massacre, he said.Puri said the Congress is yet to seek a ""proper apology"" for the 'Operation Bluestar'.Operation Bluestar was a military operation carried out in 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple .Puri said that in 2014 when Modi took over, the country's economic position stood at 11 spot. ""It has now reached the fifth position"".The Union minister said at present, the country's GDP is USD 3.95 trillion and would soon surpass that of Japan which is at the fourth spot.The country's capital expenditure is growing by 30 per cent every year, he said.In the interim budget, the capital expenditure was earmarked at Rs 11 lakh crore, he said.When the Congress was in power from 2004 to 2014, the urban spending was Rs 1.70 lakh crore, he said, adding that During the last 10 years of the Modi government, this expenditure has risen to Rs 18-19 lakh crore.On BJP candidate from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat Sanjay Tandon, Puri said Chandigarh is among the top cities of not only India but also of the world and it must be represented in the Parliament by a person of the calibre of Tandon who was familiar with the city's ethos and its problems.Tandon is pitted against Congress' Manish Tewari.Puri drew a distinction between BJP's manifestos and those of other parties.He said the difference between BJP manifesto and those of other parties is that ""we delivered what we promised in 2014, 2019, and will continue to fulfil in 2024 too"", while it's not the same case for other parties.He said the Congress is trying to come to power on a ""false narrative"" by making unviable promises.AAP, an INDIA bloc member, which is also supporting the Congress' Chandigarh nominee, is busy offering 'revaris' (freebies) to the public in order to come to power, he said.Emphasizing the importance of the ""double engine"" government, Puri exhorted people of Chandigarh to vote wisely.He said as there is a BJP government coming again at the Centre, electing a BJP candidate promises to accelerate the city's growth through the synergy of a ""double engine"" government.","Hardeep Singh Puri accuses Pakistan of using terrorism against India as an ""instrument of state policy"" He says under the Modi government, India has sent a clear message to the neighbouring country that it will eliminate terrorists in its territory.
