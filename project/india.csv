NEW DELHI: The govt, in its first Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Modi on Monday, approved the proposal to provide financial assistance to construct three crore rural and urban houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The plan would entail an investment of around Rs 5 lakh crore, sources said.TOI has learned that under the urban component of PMAY, govt will provide Rs 2 lakh to each beneficiary household for constructing dwelling units or as interest subsidy. Interestingly, the govt's proposal to expand the scheme comes a few years after the housing and urban affairs ministry had brought down the original target from 1.2 crore to approximately 1.1 crore.According to the plan for rural areas, each beneficiary will receive a higher financial assistance from govt, sources said. Currently, such households receive up to Rs 1.2 lakh in the plains and Rs 1.3 lakh in hilly states, difficult areas, and tribal and backward districts.""A boost for 'Ease of Living' and dignity for crores of Indians! The Cabinet has decided to further expand the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and construct 3 crore additional rural and urban houses. This decision underscores the government's commitment to addressing the housing needs of our nation and ensuring that every citizen leads a better quality of life. The expansion of PMAY also highlights our government's commitment to inclusive growth and social welfare,"" Modi tweeted on Monday evening.In his last Independence Day speech, Modi had announced the roll out of a scheme that will benefit families that live in cities but are living in rented houses, slums, chawls and unauthorised colonies. He had said that if such people want to build their own houses, the govt will assist them with relief in interest rates and loans from banks.Even in his election campaign, PM had announced his govt's plan to move ahead with expanding the scheme, something that was also part of BJP's election manifesto.The Centre has been implementing PMAY since 2015-16 and so far 4.2 crore houses have been completed. PMAY is a flagship scheme of the Modi govt and meant to be part of the initiative for housing for all. In the past PMAY has been dovetailed with other central and state govt programmes to provide basic amenities such as household toilets, LPG connection, electricity connection, functional household tap connection as part of the ""ease of living"" drive.After taking office in 2014, the Modi govt had announced the setting up a special investigation team on black money to clean up the economy. On the first day of the second term, the Modi govt had extended PM-Kisan to all 14.5 crore farmers and also introduced a pension scheme for farmers, small traders and self-employed.","The govt approved the proposal to provide financial assistance to construct three crore rural and urban houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) The plan would entail an investment of around Rs 5 lakh crore, sources said.

"Cabinet Committee on Security unchanged; Gadkari, Goyal, Vaishnaw, Pradhan retain key portfolios",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-committee-on-security-unchanged-gadkari-goyal-vaishnaw-pradhan-retain-key-portfolios/articleshow/110884313.cms,"Ram Mohan Naidu gets civil aviation, Scindia will handle communication

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi has retained his core team, leaving the Cabinet Committee on Security , comprising the ministries of home, defence, finance and external affairs, unchanged, while entrusting Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal with crucial portfolios .As reported first by TOI in its Sunday edition, the allies settled for mid-tier ministries , in a clear indication that coalition constraints may not come in the way of the govt's functioning. Crucial ministries such as road transport & highways, education, commerce & industry and petroleum remain in the same hands. TDP got civil aviation, the same portfolio it had held when it was part of the govt in Modi's first term.J P Nadda, who returned to govt after serving as BJP president, made a comeback to the health ministry, with added responsibility of chemicals and fertilisers, while Jual Oram also got back into the familiar territory of tribal affairs, when portfolios were announced Monday.Changes in CCS portfolios had always looked unlikely because of the PM's high level of satisfaction with their performance in the previous term.Chouhan, the former Madhya Pradesh CM, who is widely credited for the impressive farm growth in the state on his watch, will need to repeat the performance at the national level at a time when farmers have become too dependent on wheat and paddy, thanks to minimum support price.Besides grappling with incentivising diversification and increasing farmers' incomes, Chouhan's challenge will also include ensuring greater investment by the private sector, something that has been missing for years.Along with agriculture, Chouhan will also hold charge of the rural development ministry which implements MGNREGA and a massive roads programme - both top priorities for the PM - in what is going to also test his delivery skills at the Centre. The twin tasks are important, in any case, but the timing, with reports suggesting that farm and rural distress contributed to BJP's below par performance, invests them with greater urgency.The crucial responsibilities also mark the full rehabilitation of Chouhan, who appeared to be on the margins after being dropped as MP CM late last year.Former Haryana CM Manohar Lal has two meaty portfolios in power and urban development, both crucial at a time when PM Modi is keen to give a push to low-cost urban housing, redevelop the govt complex in central Delhi and ensure balanced urbanisation across the country. While the power sector has stabilised, carrying forward the reforms, especially getting power distribution companies back on their financial feet through steps like smart metering, balancing coal-based plants with the need to diversify to ""cleaner sources"" without causing disruptions, will be crucial. The expectation, quite clearly, seems to be that the former CM with the ""no-nonsense"" style of functioning may be able to drive matters.A sense of urgency explains the choice C R Patil, a BJP veteran from Gujarat known for his low profile but effective style of campaigning, for the Jal Shakti ministry where he will be required to get into ""mission mode"" to ensure delivery of tap water in households across the country, a flagship scheme of the Modi govt. Jal Shakti ministry also handles river interlinking, an ambitious scheme that the Centre is keen on.Modi has sought to balance the portfolios. For instance, he has handed communications to Jyotiraditya Scindia, and allotted civil aviation, another high-profile ministry, to TDP's K Ram Mohan Naidu, the youngest cabinet minister.Ashwini Vaishnaw, who handled communications, retains railways and electronics & IT, and has now been tasked with information and broadcasting which was under Anurag Thakur.Contrary to speculation that BJP would have to cede important portfolios due to lack of numbers, key allies appear to have settled for relatively low-profile assignments. JD(U) veteran Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lalan' got panchayati raj besides fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. LJP-RV's Chirag Paswan got food processing ministry, something which should give him immense satisfaction, if only because the charge was with his estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras. Another ally, former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, has been appointed MSME minister while former Karnataka CM and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy was assigned heavy industries and steel.","PM Narendra Modi has retained his core team, leaving the Cabinet Committee on Security unchanged.

NEW DELHI: South Africa will look to improve their batting performance when they face a spirited Bangladesh in their Group D match of the T20 World Cup on Monday. The match will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, where both teams will need to adapt to the unpredictable pitch conditions .South Africa may have a slight advantage, having already played two matches at this venue. Bangladesh, however, have some familiarity with the conditions after facing India in a warm-up game here.The Proteas struggled to secure a victory against the Netherlands on Saturday, and their batting lineup also appeared shaky in the win over Sri Lanka, where they chased modest totals of 103 and 77 runs, respectively.South Africa are likely to retain their effective four-pronged pace attack, consisting of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada , Marco Jansen, and Ottneil Baartman, with Keshav Maharaj handling the spin duties.However, their batters need to step up. Against the Netherlands, South Africa were only 33 for 3 after 10 overs. It was the efforts of Tristan Stubbs at No. 4 and David Miller , who scored an unbeaten fifty, that helped avoid a potential third consecutive World Cup defeat to the Dutch.A win in this match would secure South Africa a spot in the Super Eight stage.Bangladesh, on the other hand, started their campaign with a morale-boosting win over Sri Lanka. Yet, like South Africa, their batters need to perform better, having struggled against India in the warm-up and also showing vulnerability against Sri Lanka.The top order's inconsistency is a concern, and although Liton Das has been reliable, others need to shoulder more responsibility, especially under challenging conditions.All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan 's form with both bat and ball has been subpar, which is worrisome for Bangladesh. Additionally, their pace attack lacks a genuine fast bowler who can trouble the opposition early on, potentially putting them at a disadvantage against South Africa's powerful batting line up.Historically, South Africa have dominated Bangladesh in T20Is, winning all their encounters, including in the last two World Cup editions.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium features a bowling-friendly pitch that poses significant challenges for batters, resulting in low-scoring matches. The pitch provides substantial assistance to pace bowlers, making it difficult for batters to score runs freely. As a result, teams may find it advantageous to chase targets on this ground, considering the challenges faced by batters.Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted four T20 World Cup matches so far, with teams winning three times while chasing and once while batting first. The average score for teams batting first is 103, while for teams chasing, it's 102. Canada holds the record for the highest total of 137/7 against Ireland, while Sri Lanka holds the record for the lowest total of 77/10 against South Africa.Given the pitch report, bowlers are likely to be the most valuable players in fantasy contests. It would be wise to select more bowlers in your team. Additionally, middle-order batters who can handle both spin and pace well are likely to perform better in this match.Mustafizur Rahman poses a significant threat to the South African batters with his exceptional form. He has been consistently taking wickets, both early on and at the death, showcasing his effectiveness throughout an innings. In the last match, he proved his prowess by claiming three crucial wickets.David Miller's impactful performance in the previous match, where he scored 59 runs off 51 balls, highlights his importance to the South African team. His ability to stabilize the innings and accelerate the scoring makes him a key player, especially if South Africa bats first. Miller emerges as a prime candidate for captain/vice-captain selection in this match.Anrich Nortje has been a standout performer for South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024, claiming six wickets in their two matches so far. His ability to strike early in the powerplay and maintain pressure throughout makes him a valuable asset. If South Africa bowls first, Nortje will be instrumental in putting Bangladesh under pressure early on, making him a strong contender for captain/vice-captain selection in this game.Aiden Markram (c), Ottniel Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs.Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Taskin Ahmed, Litton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Shakib Al Hasan, Tawhid Hridoy, Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Jaker Ali Anik, Tanvir Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib.

Mumbai Airport: Close call at Mumbai Airport: Air India and IndiGo state they followed ATC instructions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/close-call-at-mumbai-airport-air-india-and-indigo-state-they-followed-atc-instructions/articleshow/110855218.cms,"MUMBAI: Following the close call at Mumbai runway on Saturday wherein two planes breached the safety margin distance, both airlines said they were given clearance by ATC. “The Air India aircraft was cleared by air traffic control (ATC) to enter the runway and subsequently cleared for take-off. It continued with the take-off movement in accordance with laid down procedures,” said Air India in a statement. An IndiGo spokesperson said the IndiGo flight from Indore was given landing clearance by ATC. “The pilot in command continued the approach and landing and followed ATC instructions,” IndiGo said.Though both airlines said their commanders merely followed instructions given by the tower controller, pilots and controllers TOI spoke to highlighted the role played by the pilots and the system that forces them to operate in a constrained space in heavy traffic.“The domino was triggered by the Air India aircraft,” said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh, based on data gathered from Flightradar24. Given the heavy air traffic that operates out of the lone operational runway of Mumbai airport , aircraft land or take off in a tight, choreographic sequence. The series of events that led to the incident occurred in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the Air India aircraft entered the runway for take-off. “The Air India aircraft was slow to take-off after it received the line-up clearance, assuming they received immediate take-off clearance,” he said. They should have informed the ATC, who would have cancelled their take-off clearance.According to Mumbai airport Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), “when an aircraft is issued with a take-off clearance after lining up on the runway it shall commence take-off immediately. If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take off, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.”The Air India aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line). AIP also provides operational rules for landings. “Aircraft shall not land on an occupied runway even if landing clearance is received,” says the AIP, listing a commander’s responsibility. “Pilot should not hesitate to ask ATC about traffic (aircraft) on the runway. If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate go around,” it adds.Capt Singh said: “The question is the degree of responsibility on each of them, the controller and the two pilots, and most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at the airport, which puts controllers and pilots in such situations.”","Both airlines said they were given clearance by ATC.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru ’s record of three straight terms in the top office. With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculation, he had little difficulty in putting together the council of ministers despite leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD (U), in particular, chose not to haggle, as was generally expected after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Key messages from Modi’s first coalition government :Short of a majority, needing allies , Modi chose to signal the new govt is still his govt, not one created by bargain-hunting allies. Not just the top cabinet jobs — home, ﬁnance, defence, foreign affairs — BJP will likely retain most heavyweight ministries.One reason TDP and JDU didn’t push a hard bargain was that Naidu and Nitish decided ﬁghts with BJP over ministries weren’t worth it if in return they can extract more govt cash for their states, even if Bihar, Andhra don’t get special category status.At least to begin with, allies going along with BJP’s dominance of key jobs means the govt can function without too many disruptions and policy reversals typical of other coalition regimes.Of course, PMO will call the shots. But the inclusion of six former chief ministers will bring administrative and policymaking experience to the council of ministers, especially since several of them have helmed big, complicated states.Three states —Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand — face polls this year. Ministers from Haryana signal BJP intends to stay with the same social engineering formula that helped it build a non-Jat coalition. That Praful Patel’s comments on not taking up a ministerial post were made in the presence of BJP netas reﬂects NDA’s keenness to keep the Maharashtra alliance intact. And picks from Jharkhand point to BJP’s strategy of shoring up non-tribal groups.Modi’s third govt will begin with not a single Muslim minister. This may change later. But as of now, a council of ministers without any Muslims may be read by some in the context of the community’s near-total support for the opposition in the elections.That Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani were both among invitees shows Modi isn’t keeping these billionaires away just because the opposition made ‘crony capitalism’ a big campaign theme. And the sizeable presence of Hindu civil society groups means concessions, if any, on BJP’s core Hindutva agenda will be minor.","With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two.

Hostile opposition skipping inauguration signals legislative challenge for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hostile-opposition-skipping-inauguration-signals-legislative-challenge-for-government/articleshow/110883765.cms,"NEW DELHI: The absence of opposition members apart from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at Sunday's swearing-in and the INDIA bloc 's reluctance to acknowledge defeat in the election are seen as pointers to frosty relations between the opposition and the governing alliance in the coming months, which could translate into friction in Parliament.Political watchers believe NDA may not have a honeymoon period that usually comes after elections and the Modi government may have to depend more on executive actions to push ahead with its reform agenda instead of legislative action.In the past, the opposition has accused government of pushing through several legislations in Parliament without adequate discussion with analysts expecting that with fewer MPs on the treasury benches, some legislative actions may have to be either put on the backburner or pushed only after consensus, which may not be easy.In fact, it also raises the prospect of some key moves, such as labour reforms through the new codes, being held up as new rules have not been notified with some states not responding to the draft rules.Government sources said despite NDA having a clear majority and BJP being the largest party by a long margin, Congress and its partners have not conceded defeat and are instead going to town portraying themselves as victors.On the eve of the swearing-in, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had said, ""This government is being formed undemocratically and unconstitutionally. We cannot give our best wishes to this government. We give our best wishes to the country and people.""Government sources confirmed that all opposition parties were invited and phone calls were made to ensure their presence. However, their absence was another example of their dislike for Modi, sources said. Soon after his election as leader of the NDA parliamentary party, Modi has sought consensus and respect for all parties.The mood in the governing camp is, however, upbeat with government watchers arguing that the Modi administration will not be hobbled or shy away from taking steps to improve the overall functioning. The filed is wide open, they said.",The absence of opposition members apart from Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at Sunday's swearing-in and the INDIA bloc's reluctance to acknowledge defeat are seen as pointers to frosty relations.

Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-3-0-must-bite-the-bullet-to-make-military-future-ready/articleshow/110883617.cms,"NEW DELHI: An aggressive China, along with its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan in the maritime domain after the land borders , will remain the foremost security threat confronting the Indian defence establishment for the foreseeable future.The new government should bite the bullet on several fronts to ensure India’s nuclear deterrence capabilities as well as conventional war-fighting machinery can meet this challenge with an integrated future-ready military within budgetary constraints in the years ahead, several experts and officials told TOI.The systemic reforms needed range from a time-bound rollout of the long-pending tri-Service theatre commands and formulation of a hard-nosed national security strategy to building a much stronger defence-industrial base backed by higher investment in R&D, overhaul of DRDO and defence PSUs, and greater private sector collaboration.For credible deterrence, India requires a more robust nuclear triad – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea. Ballistic missiles, including the over 5,000-km range Agni-5, for instance, need to be inducted in greater numbers.India also needs to bolster its weak underwater leg by inducting more and bigger nuclear-powered submarines armed with long-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (SSBNs in naval parlance). At present, there is only the 6,000-tonne INS Arihant armed with the 750-km range K-15 missiles. Two similar-sized SSBNs, of course, are to be commissioned in the coming months.Concurrently, the government should also kick off the long-pending projects to build six nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) and a third aircraft carrier since they will take over a decade to roll out. “It cannot be an either-or debate,” a top officer said.The political leadership must also “own and push” the three proposed theatre commands, two for the land borders with China and Pakistan, and a maritime one for the Indian Ocean region. “Genuine integration among the Army, Navy and IAF, instead of piecemeal steps, is indispensable,” said an official.A greater thrust, of course, is needed in building military capabilities in space, cyberspace, disruptive technologies and other such arenas. With conflicts like the ongoing Russia-Ukraine one also underscoring the sheer operational utility of long-range precision-strike vectors, the proposed Integrated Rocket Force should also figure high in the plans.Over the last decade, the NDA govt has rightly pursued the `Make in India’ policy as a strategic imperative. But the country is still far away from manufacturing fifth-generation fighter aircraft, advanced submarines, jet engines and the like. The armed forces continue to grapple with critical operational gaps, ranging from fighters and helicopters to air defence weapons, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.Consequently, a concerted push is required to design, develop and manufacture advanced weapon systems and platforms indigenously through a new defence production policy that will eventually help India get rid of its strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer.“The `strategic partnership (SP)’ policy, for one, needs to be scrapped,” a senior official said. Not a single project has till now taken off under the floundering SP policy, which was promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous production through tie-ups with foreign armament majors.Connected to all this is also the major structural revamp of DRDO proposed by the Prof K VijayRaghavan-led expert committee. “DRDO should only concentrate on fundamental and applied R&D, leaving systems integration and product management to other agencies and the private sector,” he added.Finally, the tweaking of the short-term recruitment of soldiers under the Agnipath scheme is also necessary, with the retention of Agniveers being increased to around 50% from the present 25% after their four-year service.The new government, of course, is expected to fast-track the $3.9 billion acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones from the US and the $6 billion one for 26 Rafale-M fighters from France, as also the projects to manufacture three additional French Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks and the American GE-414 jet engines by Hindustan Aeronautics.","India needs a more robust nuclear triad – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea.

Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

First session

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar in charge of the four high-profile ministries - Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs - respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths this time, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The NDA's tally is 293 seats -- well above the majority mark of 272 -- and opposition INDIA bloc 234.As per media reports citing sources, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin from June 18 with President Droupadi Murmu expected to address a joint sitting of both Houses on June 21.The MPs in the Lower House are expected to take oaths on June 18-19, following which the Speaker will be elected on June 20.","Narendra Modi takes oath of office for third consecutive term. No change in CCS composition. PM retains Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sirmar and S. N. Sitharaman. RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary takes charge of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110877628,imgsize-848760,width-400,resizemode-4/110877628.jpg"
"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883268.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. PM Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said PM Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. PM Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said PM Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under PM Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks , and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.",Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

He proposed to commence a parliamentary inquiry alleging that the previous govt ’s actions affected the country’s independence and sovereignty.Muizzu’s govt had last year announced it was not going to renew the agreement with Indian Navy for joint hydrographic surveys in Maldivian waters. He participated in Modi’s swearing-in on Sunday and met President Murmu on Monday in which he expressed gratitude for India’s continuous assistance to the Maldives.“He conveyed that he looks forward to further strengthening existing relations,” said his office.Controversy had started when three brash deputy ministers used offensive language against PM Modi’s posts on a social media platform about his trip to Lakshadweep, celebrating the natural beauty of the islands and its potential attractions for the Indian tourist.

House painters’ sons clear JEE(A) with flying colours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/house-painters-sons-clear-jeea-with-flying-colours/articleshow/110883997.cms,"TOI,

AGRA: When cousins Shivam and Abhishek cracked the JEE Advanced examination by achieving 2989 and 2372 ranks respectively, it was their fathers -- who are siblings and work as painters and earn about Rs 600 a day each -- whose joy knew no bounds as they had every single day dreamt of sending their sons to IITs.It was a tale of aspirations and dreams come true for the family in a single day. Over two years back, the painter brothers were working in a private school when someone told them that there was an examination to get admission in IITs. The two painters then decided to get their children admitted in this school and attend coaching classes for IIT entrance exam.Originally from Jhansi district, Rajendra Kumar and Vijendra Kumar moved out 15 years ago in search of work. They landed in Agra with virtually nothing and had even seen days when they had nothing for their next meal. Initial struggles notwithstanding, through their hard work and dedication, they established themselves as painters -- working in offices, homes and shops.Speaking toRajendra said, “My brother and I started working as daily wagers when we were teenagers. Now, I manage to earn Rs 600 a day, and so does my brother. We live in a rented house. After my son and nephew get into IITs, we hope to see better days in future.”Rajendra said he failed in class 10, and his younger brother studied up to class 8. Rajendra has four children -- three daughters and a son. His daughters are pursuing higher education in various fields such as MSc in horticulture, MCA and BBA respectively. Abhishek is the youngest, and he secured 2372 rank in JEE Advanced. Vijendra Kumar's elder son is studying BBA, while his younger son Shivam achieved 2989 rank in JEE Advanced.Both Abhishek and Shivam aspire to pursue BTech in computer science from IIT.Abhishek and Shivam said it was their fathers who made them aware of the JEE examination two years ago. Their dads came to know about it while doing paint work at a private school.Inspired by their fathers’ desire to see their sons become successful, the cousins agreed to prepare for IIT entrance exam. The two children got enrolled in this school, and began taking coaching classes alongside their school studies.The cousins said their motto is 'discipline, dedication and determination.' They study together, dedicating an additional 6-7 hours of studies at home after their eight-hour coaching sessions. They solve difficult problems together.When asked how social media has influenced them, they said it was 'a recipe for failure' and hence stayed away from it.Shivam and Abhishek excelled in class 12 boards as well. Shivam scored 86% in class 12 and 84% in class 10 board exam from Agra. Abhishek completed his education up to class 10 in Jhansi, securing 87% in class 10. He scored 89% in class 12 board exams.Abhishek and Shivam together said, “We used to study together and motivate each other. Despite financial constraints, our parents supported us; they would always keep a tab on how we progressed and boosted our confidence. We never counted the study hours, but prioritised completing assignments and targets set for the day. We focused on doing a lot of revision and solving mock questions papers. We dedicate our success to our fathers, who encouraged us to dream big. We assure that their hard work will not go in vain.”","Shivam and Abhishek cracked the JEE Advanced examination by achieving 2989 and 2372 ranks respectively.

This is grossly incorrect. It is a matter of pride for me to be in the council of ministers, and to represent the people of Kerala,” he wrote on social media.Gopi clarified that he was committed to working for the development of Kerala, especially Thrissur. By then, Congress functionaries in Kerala had latched on to the confusion triggered by reports about Gopi’s plan. Posting video clips of the actor-politician, elected to Parliament from Thrissur in a breakthrough for BJP after years of trying, they suggested that his remark reflected a rift in the saffron party.Some speculated that Gopi and his supporters weren’t satisfied with him being made a junior minister given the enormity of his electoral achievement. They said the BJP rank and file in Thrissur had expected at least a portfolio with independent charge for the 65-year-old, if not a cabinet berth.Sources said several senior BJP functionaries of Kerala, including P K Krishnadas, K K Gopalakrishnan, M T Ramesh and A N Radhakrishnan, met Gopi on Monday morning to dissuade him from seeking an early exit from the third Modi govt. Gopalakrishnan told TOI over the phone from Delhi in the evening that there was no uncertainty over Gopi continuing to be a part of the ministry. The BJP brass in Thrissur district, too, rushed to quell talk of the actor-politician having second thoughts about being an MoS. They expressed confidence in the BJP bosses’ ability to “resolve the issue”.Sources close to Gopi said he had been asked to focus on handling the responsibilities he had been given, based on which he would be considered for a potential promotion to cabinet rank after around six months.

NDA work brought it back; oppn not an adversary: Bhagwat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nda-work-brought-it-back-oppn-not-an-adversary-bhagwat/articleshow/110884414.cms,"NAGPUR: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Monday said that NDA 's return to power after a decade when it was in office was a testimony to the good things that happened on its watch, even as he cautioned the political class not to treat difference of opinion as disputes and emphasised the need for evolving a consensus on the challenges facing the country.In his first public address post Lok Sabha poll results, Bhagwat criticised all sides for using falsehoods and using vituperative language during the campaign, saying the electoral discourse violated the decency that parties are expected to observe. “Your opponent is not an adversary, he only represents a counter viewpoint,” Bhagwat said as he expressed dismay over using technology for promoting false narratives and even “dragging RSS” into the electoral combat.“Elections are a necessity in a democracy and two sides compete against each other. However, there should be a degree of restraint, which should not be forgotten. Technology was used to spread lies about RSS which is a gross misuse of knowledge. The noble use knowledge for good, the evil misuse it,” he said.He praised the NDA govt for its performance in diverse fields. “It is a fact that we have done well on many counts in the period. Going by the parameters used by the modern countries to judge economic progress, we have done well. In defence, we are clearly stronger. We have done well in arts, culture, sports and science while the prestige of our country has gone up. Even developed foreign powers are now constrained to listen what we have to say,” said Bhagwat in remarks which may appear to be significant in view of the perception in certain quarters about RSS's unhappiness with BJP.However, Bhagwat, the top voice in Sangh Parivar, also cautioned saying that the process had to be carried forward to liberate country from the challenges still besetting it.Amidst the drift of a section of dalits to the opposition — a factor which is considered to have contributed to BJP's below-par performance — Bhagwat focused on bridging the caste divide by reiterating the words of the third sarsanghchalak, Balasaheb Deoras, who had said that untouchability needed to be removed ""lock, stock and barrel"".“Injustice has happened in society and it has left an acrimony in the mindset even today. There is no reference to untouchability in the scriptures like Vedas or Upanishads. It’s only a mind work of selfish elements. The custom may have been formed at some point for a particular time-period, but it needs to be eradicated now,” said Bhagwat. He called upon swayamsevaks to make it a point to establish personal relations with people of all social segments.Criticism of the election rhetoric formed an important part of Sangh chief's address at the passing-out ceremony of over 900 swayamsevaks, who completed the final stage of training at the Hedgewar Smruti Mandir campus here.“There is a dignity to the election process. People are being elected to Parliament and run our country. They should do so by consent. Need of the hour is to take everyone along. A contest is not a war in which criticism peaks to ugly levels. And this is not the way a campaign is run,” he said.Congress and PM have both accused each other of lowering the quality of discourse, with the former saying that PM used polarising themes. Bhagwat, however, refrained from blame-apportionment even as he echoed the concern over use of Artificial Intelligence and deep fakes to promote lies. He denounced the way technology was used to propagate falsehood.There are big challenges before the country, he said with a piece of advice for the govt over the state of affairs in Manipur. “Manipur continues to burn and nobody is paying attention towards the north-eastern state. Addressing Manipur should be the govt’s priority now. There was peace for nearly 10 years, and we thought the gun culture had ended and suddenly mayhem happened,” said Bhagwat. He also backed environmental protection, increasing green cover and water conversation.The guests of honour at the event included heir to the Piramal Group and Mukesh Ambani’s son-in-law Anand Piramal, Bharat Biotech chief Krishna Ella and actor Nana Patekar’s son Malhar.","Mohan Bhagwat criticised all sides for using falsehoods and using vituperative language during the campaign. “Your opponent is not an adversary, he only represents a counter viewpoint,” he said.

"In a first, a Buddhist to head minority affairs ministry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-a-buddhist-to-head-minority-affairs-ministry/articleshow/110883861.cms,"NEW DELHI: In Kiren Rijiju , minority affairs ministry has for the first time got a Buddhist as its head. He will be helped by George Kurian, a Christian from Kerala and a surprise inclusion as he is not a member of either House of Parliament.The ministry was led, even under BJP govts , by Muslims, the largest minority community. However, the pattern broke when Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi resigned a day before his term as Rajya Sabha member ended in July 2022 and women and child development minister Smriti Irani got additional charge of the ministry. Irani is a Hindu married to a Parsi, and had a Christian, John Barla, assisting her as minister of state.The chairman of National Minorities Commission, Iqbal Singh Lalpura, is a Sikh and when he was appointed to the post, it marked a break from the pattern of the position mostly being helmed by Muslims.The choice of Rijiju could have been prompted by NDA lacking a Muslim in its ranks in both Houses. It is not clear whether any ally would like to address the issue by getting a member from the community elected to RS. In 2014, BJP appointed RS MP Najma Heptulla as minority affairs minister. She resigned in July 2016 when she was appointed governor of Manipur. Naqvi, who had been MoS since 2014, was elevated to the post of minister and served till 2019. He was re-appointed as minister in the Modi govt's second term till July 2022.Abdul Rahman Antulay was appointed by UPA govt as the first minority affairs minister in Jan 2006. He was followed by Salman Khurshid (May 2009 to Oct 2012) and K Rahman Khan (Oct 2012 to May 2014).","The ministry was led, even under BJP govts, by Muslims.
