During the operation, Singh was found operating one of the processing units, where he was producing adulterated turmeric using non-edible and banned substances such as spoiled leaves, rice, millets, wood dust, chilli heads, acids, and oils."" said the DCP.Despite their attempts to flee, both Singh and Sarfaraj were apprehended and interrogated. Singh confessed to be the owner of the manufacturing unit, while Malik admitted to supplying these adulterated spices, the officer said.Further investigations led to the discovery of another processing unit on Kali Khata Road, Karawal Nagar, where Sarfaraj was caught manufacturing adulterated spices, the DCP said.""The Department of Food & Safety was informed, which conducted inspections, collected samples of the recovered adulterated spices from both factories. Accordingly, a case was registered under relevant sections of the law, and all three accused were arrested,"" added DCP Paweriya.Police said that both the unit owners, by producing adulterated spices, were not only cheating the public but also playing with their lives.During interrogation, it was revealed that Singh and Sarfaraj had set up their units in 2021 to make more profit by producing adulterated spices, police said, adding that Malik had been involved in the sale and purchase of clothes before venturing into the adulterated spices business in 2019 and purchased a tempo for their supply.The suspects have been remanded to judicial custody while further investigation remains underway, police added.","Delhi Police has seized a staggering 15 tonnes of spurious spices being manufactured at two factories in northeast Delhi's Karawal Nagar area.

Sandeshkhali rape charges filed on 'Suvendu Adhikari prod': BJP man in sting clip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sandeshkhali-rape-charges-filed-on-suvendu-prod-bjp-man-in-sting-clip/articleshow/109850352.cms,"KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Saturday released a sting video showing a Sandeshkhali BJP functionary admitting that many of the charges, including those of rape, were levelled following instructions from BJP seniors, including assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari.The 33-minute video focuses on Sandeshkhali Block-II BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal.""We have followed Suvendu da's (BJP MLA and assembly opposition leader Adhikari's) instructions. He helped us. We convinced Trinamool people to do all this (level the allegations). They (the complainants) never said no, they did whatever we told them to do. He (Adhikari) had told us that if we could not do this, if we could not get the big shots (Trinamool seniors of the area) arrested, we would not be able to stand (survive) here,"" Koyal is heard saying. ""I had to do all this very smartly. We said it (the alleged rapes and torture) happened seven-eight months ago. We had to work hard,"" he adds.Trinamool, including party chief Mamata Banerjee and national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, latched on to the video. The CM first took to X and then spoke at length at public meetings in Nadia's Chakdah and Taherpur on Saturday.""The sting shows how deep the rot is within BJP. In their hatred for Bengal's progressive thought and culture, the Bangla birodhis (the anti-Bengal brigade) orchestrated a conspiracy to defame our state at every possible level. Never before in the history of India has a ruling party in Delhi tried to malign an entire state and its people. History will witness how Bengal will rise in rage against Delhi's conspiratorial regime and ensure their bisarjan (defeat),"" she wrote on the X platform.Adhikari himself was more guarded in his initial response, opting not to say anything directly about its contents: ""I have not seen the video. I will find out whose voice it is and then speak on this matter."" Later on Saturday, he said truth could be ""twisted and a misleading version circulated"". ""But its shelf life is very, very short. Ultimately, truth prevails,"" he added. ""I will approach the CBI and seek a full probe so that the perpetrators are punished,"" Adhikari said.One of the first Sandeshkhali complainants and now BJP's candidate from Basirhat, Rekha Patra, called the video a Trinamool ""ploy"".""The video is fake, there is no truth in it. Koyal is a BJP man, he can never say all this,"" she said. But she also added that Trinamool Congress ""may have threatened Koyal to say all this"".The video shows BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal crediting Suvendu Adhikari for everything. “It was he (Adhikari) who controlled.... Why has the Sandeshkhali movement survived for so long? He is still holding on, that is why. No one else has the ability to sustain this movement for so long,” he says in the video. “Empty pockets (khali haat) canot do all this,” he replies when the interviewer asks him whether Adhikari sent mobile phones and money.Koyal is also heard saying some women backed off from making complaints because they were scared of going to police stations and of the investigations that would follow. The video shows a woman saying she backed out because she had not been instructed properly. BJP Sandeshkhali Block-I president Shanti Dolui is seen nodding in agreement with the interviewer when asked whether the pistols recovered by central agencies later were “planted”. The male interviewer remains unidentified throughout the video but, from the body language of Koyal and others, it appears they are comfortable with him and know him.“You scripted a good drama on Sandeshkhali,” CM Mamata Banerjee later said in Chakdah. “The fact has been unveiled. I have been telling you all for some time that this is a conspiracy and a BJP-scripted drama. I have heard of this expose from the media and have not seen it in detail myself but I will definitely see it,” she added, tying it up with the molestation allegations against governor C V Ananda Bose: “Centre’s representative, the honourable governor, have you seen what he has done, what he does with Raj Bhavan employees, calls girls and molests them?And then Modi spends the night there and leaves. The person who gives a big sandesh (message) on Sandeshkhali: why have you not given one sandesh to governor?”Koyal himself later called the “viral video a conspiracy and a plot”. “They have used technology to fake my voice. This is a ploy to defame me, my party, the mothers of Sandeshkhali and my leader (Adhikari),” he added.","The 33-minute video focuses on Sandeshkhali Block-II BJP mandal president Gangadhar Koyal. ""I had to do all this very smartly. We said it (the alleged rapes and torture) happened seven-eight months ago,"" Koyal is heard saying.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109854788,imgsize-691326,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109854788.jpg"

There is no truth in it. BJP is playing with the lives of people and bodies.""He further suggested that such attacks are orchestrated to benefit the BJP whenever elections are held, drawing a comparison to the 2019 Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.""These attacks are not really happening but just meant to benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party. Whenever elections take place, such stunts are played like it happened last time,"" he asserted.The terror attack in occurred in the Bakrabal (Sanai) area of Poonch, targeting two IAF vehicles.

At a rally in Morena, Modi claimed Rajiv Gandhi abolished the inheritance tax to safeguard his inheritance from Indira Gandhi's death.Campainging in the run up to the third phase saw the BJP-led NDA and the INDIA bloc locked in fierce exchanges on reservations , terroris, Article 370; and sexual harassment allegations against JD(S) leader Prajwal Revanna, which has rocked Karnataka politics.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , leading the BJP's charge, challenged the Congress to provide written assurance that they won't allocate reservations for Muslims among the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.In response, the Congress and its allies accused the BJP of attempting to alter the Constitution and abolish reservation policies. The main opposition party, which has pledged to eliminate the 50% cap on reservations, also demanded clarity from the BJP regarding its stance on the matter.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, accompanied by party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, emphasized issues related to social justice, unemployment, perceived injustice towards farmers, and alleged preferential treatment towards certain businessmen.On the other hand, BJP leaders criticised the Congress regarding wealth redistribution and inheritance tax matters, accusing them of practicing appeasement politics. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi reiterated the Congress' pledge to conduct a caste census and economic survey if they come into power.The BJP also criticized the Congress for what they perceive as a failure to tackle ""anti-national activities,"" instances of 'Love Jihad,' and what they term as 'appeasement politics'.They repeatedly mentioned incidents like the bomb blast at a cafe on March 1, the murder of Neha Hiremath on a college campus in Hubballi on April 18, and the chanting of pro-Pakistan slogans in the corridors of Vidhana Soudha on February 27.The last day of campaigning also saw Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel, BJP state unit president CR Paatil, and minister Harsh Sanghavi participate in motorcycle rallies.The BJP faced backlash from the Kshatriya community over a remark made by Rupala in Rajkot.The Aam Aadmi Party, contesting in Bhavnagar and Bharuch, organized rallies with Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and a roadshow in Bharuch with Sunita Kejriwal, the wife of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.Uttar Pradesh witnessed numerous roadshows and rallies in its 10 constituencies, with Mulayam Singh Yadav's family members contesting in Mainpuri, Firozabad, and Budaun.During rallies, Amit Shah targeted Rahul Gandhi, suggesting the need for a 'Congress Dhoondho Yatra' after June 4. BJP leaders alleged that Congress and SP leaders did not attend the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya for fear of alienating their vote bank.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav campaigned extensively, attacking the BJP over reservation and other issues.Tejashwi Yadav campaigned extensively for the RJD in Bihar. Despite heavy rains in Assam, both ruling and opposition parties campaigned vigorously. The BJP highlighted development schemes, while opposition parties focused on citizenship, connectivity, and unemployment issues.Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, also criticized the BJP over accusations of sexual harassment against Prajwal Revanna, who is the MP for Hassan and a leader of the JD(S), which is an ally of the BJP.In response, BJP leader Amit Shah and others have questioned why the Congress-led government in Karnataka didn't take action against Revanna sooner. The JD(S) joined the BJP-led NDA coalition in September last year.Prajwal Revanna, who is the grandson of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda and was the JD(S)-BJP alliance candidate from the Hassan seat, faced elections on April 26. Prajwal's father, H.D. Revanna, was arrested by a Special Investigation Team on Saturday in connection with a kidnapping case linked to allegations of sexual abuse against Prajwal, following the rejection of his anticipatory bail plea by a court.During his visit to Uttar Pradesh on the last day of campaigning on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi addressed two rallies and later visited the Ram temple in Ayodhya.He criticised the ""dynastic politics"" of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, stating that while the opposition alliance focuses on benefiting their own families, he and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath are working for the betterment of the nation's future generations.Highlighting that he and Yogi Adityanath do not have children, he emphasized that they are working for the children of the nation.","A total of 92 seats across 11 states and Union Territories will be going to the polls on May 7.

NEW DELHI: The Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , has provided two reasons for his consistent choice of wearing a white T-shirt saying, the white T-shirt represents "" transparency "" and "" simplicity "". This was shared by Rahul in a video released by the Congress on their social media platforms, where he also answered various light-hearted questions.In the video captioned ""A day campaigning in Karnataka.Some light rapid fire questions and some very illustrious company"", Rahul talks on the significance of having a clear understanding of ideology.He said, ""In my view, you cannot go as a large organisation towards power without a clear understanding of the ideology. We have to convince the people of our ideology which is pro-poor, pro-women, plural, treating everybody equally.""""So the fight at an organisational level, at a national level, is always about ideology,"" Rahul added.The white T-shirt has become a distinctive 'trademark' of Rahul's appearance since his participation in the Bharat Jodo Yatra, which covered the distance from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.When asked about his preference for the white T-shirt, Rahul says, ""Transparency and simplicity and I just don't care much about clothes. I prefer it (to be) simple.""He also humorously remarks that the best part of campaigning is ""When it ends!""Rahul said that he has traveled on the road for 70 days, starting with the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which he clarified wasn't a campaign but involved even more rigorous work. He likes making speeches during the campaign as it ""makes one think about what the country needs', he added.In the video, Rahul engages with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, asking about his likes and dislikes during the campaign. Kharge responds positively saying, ""There is nothing bad. It's good because we are doing this for the country. The one who is spoiling the country, when we work to stop them, we feel good. At least we are doing something for the country.""Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah also also makes an appearance in the video, highlighting the importance of ideology in their endeavors.","The white T-shirt has become a distinctive 'trademark' of Rahul's appearance since his participation in the Bharat Jodo Yatra.

Wadettiwar claimed that Karkare was not killed by terrorist Ajmal Kasab but by an RSS-affiliated police officer.""During 26/11, Hemant Karkare was not shot by Kasab.A police officer shot him on the instructions of RSS . Public Prosecutor Adv. Ujjwal Nikam knew this yet chose to hide this fact,"" he said.He further accused Ujjwal Nikam, the government's lawyer in the 26/11 case and a BJP candidate for the upcoming Lok Sabha election, of being a traitor for suppressing this information.Wadettiwar's comments drew sharp criticism from various quarters. In response, he clarified that his statement about Karkare's death was based on a book written by retired police officer SM Mushrif titled ""Who Killed Karkare."" The Congress leader also expressed his disappointment with the lack of morality in contemporary politics, saying, ""There is no morality in today's politics. People who are in politics for power will sell the country off,""The BJP strongly condemned Wadettiwar's remarks, accusing the Congress of giving a clean chit to Pakistan regarding the 26/11 attacks. BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala criticized Congress for prioritizing vote bank politics over national interest and questioned their support for various controversial figures.""Shocking and unbelievable...No wonder Pakistan is praying for Congress and Rahul. Congress is again putting Votebank Rajniti above Rashtraniti. After crying for Batla, Afzal, Yakub, Naxals and labelling them Shaheed now doubting patriots like Ujjwal Nikam & clean chit to Pak!"" Shehzad Poonawala said.The BJP legal cell in Nagpur filed a complaint against Wadettiwar for his ""shameful and derogatory"" statement about Hemant Karkare's death.Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde also condemned Wadettiwar's statement, while Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis drew a contrast between the BJP's association with Ujjwal Nikam and the Congress's alleged alignment with Kasab.Fadnavis alleged that opposition ""is worried about Ajmal Kasab"" and wants to support terrorists by targeting Mr Nikam. ""The Congress is claiming Ujjwal Nikam insulted Kasab. Kasab terrorised the city and the Congress is worried about Kasab. Mahayuti is supporting Ujjwal Nikam and MVA is supporting Kasab. Now you decide who you should vote for,"" he said.Former Congress leader Milind Deora, who was the South Mumbai MP during the 2008 terror attack, called Wadettiwar's statement ""very shameful"" and recalled the pain experienced during that time. Deora also mentioned a book released by Congress leaders that shifted attention away from Pakistan's involvement in the attack, titled ""26/11 RSS ki sazish.""","Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar sparked a major controversy with his remarks about the death of police official Hemant Karkare during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

He also had syrinx, a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord. These limited his right shoulder movement. In Oct 2008, he underwent surgery at a private hospital and four months later he went to Aarthi Scans in Kilpauk for an MRI scan to evaluate the syrinx.David's wife Regina Mary, claimed he was given a heavy dose of anaesthesia, which led to cardiac arrest and brain death. He was shifted to a nearby private hospital but succumbed after 15 days. The family filed a case against the scanning centre with the forum.Aarthi Scans attributed David's death to surgical procedures and complications arising from the operation. The centre cited neurosurgery literature indicating that such genetic neuro abnormalities often remain unresolved even after surgery, and the cardiac arrest was coincidental.The scan centre argued that anaesthesia is usually not administered for MRIs, but David's doctor recommended it as he was suffering excessive pain, anxiety and obesity, which made scanning without sedation difficult. The centre stated that only a 1-mg dose was given, which was one-tenth of the amount ""necessary to cause death.""If anaesthesia had been administered incorrectly, David would not have survived longer than a minute, yet he lived for 30 minutes after administration and was hospitalized for 15 days, the scanning centre stated.Also, the centre did not provide documents of the anaesthetic used, resulting in a negative presumption, the forum noted.Furthermore, the centre failed to provide medical literature to substantiate its claim that the cardiac arrest resulted from the surgery rather than the anaesthesia.","David (45) had been suffering from cervical spondylosis, a condition affecting spinal discs in the neck.

With a population of nearly 500 from 96 families, and nearly 230 voters, the village is gearing up to vote for the Guwahati Lok Sabha seat on May 7.This, after many of them already cast their votes for the Shillong Lok Sabha seat on April 19, in the first phase.Interestingly, nearly 65 families in the village also hold voting rights in Meghalaya due to their proximity to the border. Living along the disputed Assam-Meghalaya border areas, these "" dual voters "" have been exercising their franchise in Assam for decades, even after the creation of Meghalaya in 1972. Despite the Meghalaya poll officials' stance against double voting, residents with valid identification proof from both states continue to participate in elections in both, a practice that authorities find challenging to prevent.Unlike the Langpih area along the disputed interstate border, where people conceal their ""dual voter identity"" due to historical conflicts, the situation in peaceful Ranibari is different, with residents openly exercising their voting rights in both states.Assam govt provides them electricity and has built the main road, while Meghalaya govt offers job cards under MGNREGA, water supply, and assistance for agriculture, among other benefits. Though not at a loss with support from both states, villagers of Ranibari seek a permanent resolution to their voting dilemma. Rangsha, acting as the spokesperson, expresses the community's desire for clarity and a solution to the dual voting issue. He questions the expectation to abstain from voting when authorities from both sides encourage participation.""When booth-level officers from both Assam and Meghalaya approached us, we went ahead and got voter ID cards issued by the respective district election officers. When the election authorities from both sides want us to vote, can we sit idle at home on election day,"" Rangsha says. Both NPP and Congress workers were active in the village during the poll campaign for Shillong LS seat, with governing NPP leaving behind posters to mark its presence. Villagers are now preparing to vote at polling stations in Muduki and Bagan villages on May 7.There are nearly 230 voters in Ranibari. Partha P Rabha, a local youth, echoes the sentiment that possessing voter ID cards from both states implies the right to vote in both.Efforts to link Aadhaar with voter IDs are under way, which Kamrup district election officials believe will help address the issue of ""dual voting"".","Nearly 65 families in the village of Ranibari also hold voting rights in Meghalaya due to their proximity to the border.

Sharad Pawar votes from Baramati after 10 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharad-pawar-votes-from-baramati-after-10-years/articleshow/109865024.cms,"PUNE: A decade after he changed his address to Mumbai and has been voting there,

Baramati

on Tuesday. ""Pawar Saheb will not cast his vote in Mumbai.

All formalities for a change in his constituency have been completed. He will vote at the polling centre in Govindbaug,"" Prashant Jagtap, city unit chief of NCP (SCP), said.

Party workers said the change in constituency is significant. Pawar's daughter and sitting MP Supriya Sule has been pitted against her sister-in-law Sunetra Pawar from Baramati and it is a matter of pride for the party, they said.

Pawar had changed his residential address to Mumbai to fulfil the requirements of Mumbai Cricket Association's election which he had then contested, the NCP leader said.

He was the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India from 2005 to 2008, head of the International Cricket Council from 2010 to 2012 and chief of Mumbai Cricket Association from October 2013 to January 2017.

Pawar votes from Baramati after 10 years

The former Union agriculture minister became a permanent resident of Bhulabhai Desai Road in Malabar Hill in Mumbai. He had given copies of a landline telephone bill, his PAN card and a bank passbook as proof of residence in Mumbai.

Pawar has now gone back to his previous address in Baramati and his polling station falls under Malegaon in Baramati. ""Since the early 1960s, Pawar has been a Baramati voter. After a break, he is again voting here which is a morale booster for us,"" Sachin Dodke, a

voter

and NCP (SCP) leader from Warje, said.

Other NCP workers said Pawar's voting from Baramati will inspire citizens to cast their votes too. ""For many voters in Baramati, the actual fight is between Sharad Pawar and his nephew deputy CM Ajit Pawar.

It is an a emotional one too. So even moves like shifting the voting constituency from Mumbai to Baramati will create a buzz here,"" an NCP (SCP) worker said.",Sharad Pawar will not cast his vote in Mumbai.

MUMBAI: Money and politics go hand in hand. Among Lok Sabha contenders from Mumbai, three are from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party ( SVPP ), a registered unrecognised political party that was investigated by the income-tax department two years ago along with 200 other such parties for indulging in tax evasion by collecting donations through banking channels from their clients and returning the amount in cash after deducting commissions.SVPP had no visible activity but had received a Rs 55.5 crore in donation when it was raided by tax officials in 2022, according to income-expense details submitted to the Election Commission that year. All three candidates of SVPP have shown nil income in poll affidavits; they do not own any vehicle, and two of them have submitted that they do not even have a house.TOI visited the residence of one of the candidates, 60-year-old Kamlesh Vyas, in a Borivali housing society. He was not at home, and his wife was unaware that he was contesting the election from Mumbai North constituency. None of the other residents in the society appeared to know anything either.Over the phone, Kamlesh said that he was not an expert to talk about the party's I-T case but would discuss his work afterwards. He did not call back.Apart from Kamlesh Vyas, 38-year-old Mahesh Sawant is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party’s candidate from Mumbai South Central, whereas 45-year-old Bhavani Chaudhary is the candidate from Mumbai North East.SVPP runs from a hole-in-the-wall photocopying centre in a chawl in Borivali East. Its founder, Dashrath Parikh, said all political parties are linked to “wrongdoing” of donations. He said, “We had four corporators in Gujarat and were trying to increase our vote share to fulfil the requirements under Representation of the People’s Act, 1951 and thus accept donations through electoral bonds.”He said the I-T cases are still pending and declined to comment further. “We spent lots of the money on party work, as travelling, purchasing flags, and other election-related activities require money,” Parikh said.The party told EC it spent the Rs 55.5 crore it received in 2022 on various activities, including Rs 10 crore on education, Rs 15 crore on food, Rs 16 crore on winter clothes, and Rs 11 crore on relief to poor.According to I-T sources, most such parties are allegedly formed in connivance with hawala operators, mainly for tax evasion. They collect money from clients of hawala operators as donation and then return the money to the respective client in cash after deducting their commission. Party leaders receive 0.01% of the total amount as commission. The hawala operator manages the accounts of these parties and collects their fee separately from the client. The clients avail up to 100% tax deduction on the donated amount under Representation of the People’s Act.","Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Party was investigated by the income-tax department two years ago along with 200 other such parties.

Canada has so far not shared any evidence to back its case against India, and, according to Indian authorities, Canadian authorities haven’t yet shared details with India about the charges against the arrested Indian men.Speaking about the arrests, Trudeau on Saturday stressed this was important because Canada was a rule of law country with a “strong and independent justice system”. He made the remarks at an event organised in Toronto to celebrate Sikh culture and heritage.“As the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,” said Trudeau, who precipitated a diplomatic crisis with India with his allegations last year in Parliament that Indian agents may have killed Nijjar.Trudeau went on to say that every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada, while acknowledging that, according to local media reports, Sikhs in Canada were feeling unsafe after the killing of Nijjar.The arrests came days after a report by Washington Post identified an Indian official who allegedly masterminded a foiled plot in the US to eliminate another Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and who may have had a role in similar plots in Canada. Ottawa claims to be coordinating its actions with the US.In another development last week, a Canadian public inquiry, which accused China of meddling in Canada’s electoral process, also named India for foreign interference. While India has not officially responded, govt sources here said the report was a “sham” and a self-serving exercise. On the arrests, sources said the matter could only be looked into if Canada shared details about the charges.On the allegations of Indian involvement, Canada actually has not denied that it has so far not shared any evidence with India. However, it had also said earlier this year that with progress in the investigations, the police would be able to share more information for India to consider.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau doubled down on the arrests last week of three Indian nationals for the murder of pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
