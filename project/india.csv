BJP repeatedly tried to impose its will on people of Tamil Nadu: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-repeatedly-tried-to-impose-its-will-on-people-of-tamil-nadu-congress/articleshow/109180864.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday accused the BJP of repeatedly trying to impose its will on the people of Tamil Nadu and flagged issues such as ""devastating impacts"" of NEET in the state and insufficient devolution of taxes from the Centre. In a post on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rally in Coimbatore and posed questions to him on key issues affecting the state.""Today, PM Modi will be in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. In a state which has a long history of advocating for cooperative federalism, the BJP has repeatedly tried to impose its will on the people,"" Ramesh said.He said, ""The Modi Sarkar's track record in TN begs the question - does PM Modi want to represent the people, or does he want to rule over them?""Ramesh said the NEET exam was introduced by the BJP government in 2017, and it faced widespread public backlash due to fears that it would unfairly disadvantage students from poor and marginalised communities.""Very soon, these fears were confirmed. According to 2019 data, only 2% of students who qualified for the exam did so without enrolling in private coaching. Since coaching centres charge between 2.5 Lakh to 5 Lakh per student, it is nearly impossible for marginalised students to qualify for the exam,"" he said.Sure enough, the Congress leader said, data shows that the number of Tamil-medium government school students securing seats in medical courses reduced drastically after NEET was introduced -- from 600 in 2016 (before NEET) to just 5 in 2017, 7 in 2018 and 0 in 2019.""To address this injustice, the TN Assembly has passed two NEET bills since 2017 that exempt students from taking the exam, but neither bill was given assent by the President. The most tragic element of this narrative is that Tamil Nadu has experienced several student suicides prior to the exam every year since its inception,"" Ramesh said.All of Tamil Nadu has borne witness to the devastating impacts of NEET, he said and asked why the prime minister has not even acknowledged the damage that his policies have caused.""Last week, the state of Tamil Nadu was compelled to move the Supreme Court as the Union government has been withholding much-needed disaster relief funds. Tamil Nadu has been dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Michuang, which rocked the state in December 2023, causing unprecedented flooding and significant damage,"" he said.The state government has already spent Rs 3,406 crore from the State Disaster Relief Fund and other state funds but it has not been enough to cover the extensive damage caused by the cyclone, Ramesh said.In such situations, states can seek additional aid from the National Disaster Relief Fund, which was established for the express purpose of assisting when calamities are ""beyond the coping capacity of the state government"", he said.The Tamil Nadu government had applied to this fund as early as December 19 last year and then again on January 10 for the release of Rs 18,214 crore of aid, he said.""Yet, more than 4 months later, the Centre has not taken a final decision. Needless to say, this delay in the release of funds has severe implications for the people of Tamil Nadu,"" Ramesh said.What ""vendetta"" does the PM have against the Tamil people to be so indifferent to their needs, he asked.""In 2008, when PM Modi was still Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had kicked up a storm with his remarks on fiscal injustice and insufficient devolution of taxes from the Centre. However, now that the BJP is in power, the shoe is on the other foot,"" he alleged.In January, the Tamil Nadu finance minister pointed out that the state received only 29 paise for every rupee it gave to the Centre, he said.Ramesh said that even though Tamil Nadu accounts for 6.124 per cent of India's population, its share of central taxes has decreased from 5.305 per cent under the 12th Finance Commission to 4.079 per cent under the 15th Finance Commission.""This reduction in Tamil Nadu's share comes amidst the Modi Sarkar's introduction of a cess raj, evolved specifically to avoid sharing revenues with states,"" he said.""Is the PM's change of heart on this issue entirely attributable to his desire for centralising power?"" Ramesh said and asked Modi to break his silence on these issues.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi

"Kotia, where most say they vote in two states",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kotia-where-most-say-they-vote-in-two-states/articleshow/109177573.cms,"Voters in Kotia along Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border have been caught in a decades-long territorial dispute between the two states. But they aren’t complaining. Call it a case of having the best of both worlds or having your cake and eating it too but Kotia voters say they enjoy a rare privilege — the right to cast votes in two states.Over 2,500 electors of the 21 tribal villages hold voter IDs, ration cards, and even pension cards of both states as they fall under two Lok Sabha constituencies: Araku in Andhra and Koraput in Odisha.In 1968, Odisha moved SC laying claim to the villages. The court, however, ruled that interstate boundary issues fall outside its jurisdiction and can only be resolved by Parliament. Consequently, a permanent injunction was imposed, restraining either of the states from taking any action.However, when asked about the double voting rights, Andhra’s CEO Mukesh Kumar Meena called it illegal. “One person can cast only one vote at one location. Enrolment in two states is illegal. One should cancel the registration in one state to enrol in another,” he said.Nevertheless, the big question these electors face this time is which state they will vote in, as both Araku and Koraput go to polls on May 13.To get a feel of the geopolitical complexities and the voter pulse, TOI visited this cluster. Here’s the tug-of-war: Andhra claims the villages belong to its ParvathipuramManyam district, while Odisha asserts they lie in Koraput. Land surveys, records, and various forms of evidence fuel arguments from both sides vying for control. Development initiatives, political disputes, and resource allocation further complicate matters.In the run-up to elections, debates here centre around the contrasting approaches of the two states — Odisha’s infrastructure push versus Andhra’s welfare programmes. Odisha has made significant inroads, cementing its presence with concrete roads connecting villages to Kotia, the main panchayat. It has also established schools, a primary health centre, and an Indian Reserve Battalion outpost. Andhra, meanwhile, is focusing on financial aid through welfare schemes. This becomes evident while traversing from Salur in Andhra towards Kotia, as one nears the Odisha border.While voters residing downhill seem to identify more closely with Andhra, those uphill may favour Odisha. But, generally, villagers, who eke out a living cultivating millets and some paddy on the rugged slopes of the Eastern Ghats, feel they hold the upper hand as dual identity cards grant them access to benefits of both the states.For instance, Chodipalli Latchayya, a resident of Dhulibhadra hamlet in Salur mandal, Andhra, possesses a ration card under this identity. He also doubles up as Latchayya Pangi on another ration card in Odisha’s Pottangi block, Koraput. Similarly, Gemele Kati, who enjoys “voting rights” in both the states, has an Aadhaar card issued on an Andhra address, and is seeking a pension based on that.Villages too have dual official names. “Ganjaeipadar” in Odisha becomes “Ganjaibhadra” in Andhra, influenced by Telugu. Similarly, “Nerallavalasa” in Andhra becomes “Naradbalsa” in Odisha, and “Pattuchenneru” becomes “Phatuseneri”.When asked where they would vote, residents of Nerallavalasa and Thadivalsa — two of the 21 disputed villages — picked Andhra’s booth as the state offers more welfare schemes. Andhra provides a monthly welfare pension of Rs 3,000 compared to Odisha’s Rs 500. Andhra’s incentives, ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh per family per year, are a big draw.In the Kotia cluster, consisting of tribals from Konda Dora, Mooka Dora, Gadaba, and Jatapu communities, some communicate in Telugu and Odia, but most speak the ‘Kui’ dialect.Vanthala Sana, 60, from Nerellavalasa village under Sarika panchayat, said the dispute is only between the states, not people. “We receive more benefits from Andhra; I will vote at an Andhra booth,” she added.Abhi Gemel, who too receives benefits from both the states, said he would support Odisha as their culture is closer to that of the tribals of Koraput. However, the benefits have not translated into uplift. Most villagers are illiterate or dropouts, which is reflected in the low number of residents securing govt jobs in either state.","21 tribal villages along Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border have been caught in a

The man moved Delhi HC for quashing of criminal proceedings.When HC rejected his plea, the man through Prabhjit Jauhar moved SC and argued before a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine G Masih that it was a clear abuse of the criminal law as the marriage was annulled by a family court after considering all aspects of the couple's married life.Jauhar also brought to court's notice that the woman in 2008, a year after the husband left home, had also initiated proceedings under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The said proceedings were dismissed on merit by trial court and has attained finality as the woman had preferred no appeal against the trial court's decision.Justices Nagarathna and Masih felt that no purpose would be served to keep the differences between the separated couple alive through criminal proceedings and decided to quash the pending criminal proceedings.After examining a few previous judgements on the narrow conspectus in which SC could exercise its power under Article 142 , the bench determined the case in hand to be one where such exercise of power was necessary to save the man from unnecessary post-divorce harassment. Allowing the man's appeal and setting aside HC decision not to entertain an appeal against trial court's decision, the bench quashed the FIR under Section 498A of IPC and subsequent proceedings.","The woman was married to Arun Jain in Nov 1996 and a daughter was born to them

The amount was spent to make available police personnel for his security during his house arrest.A bench of Justices MM Sundresh and SVN Bhatti emphasised that it was Navlakha who had sought house arrest and asked him to take a call early on payment as the amount would keep rising.The social activist has been under house arrest from Nov 2022.""If you have asked for it, you have to pay.

Court was hearing NIA’s appeal against HC order that granted bail to him.After a brief hearing, court adjourned it for April 19 and extended the interim stay on Navlakha’s bail.

The weeks preceding the final announcement saw moments of muscle flexing and one-upmanship between the allies.As per the final deal, Shiv Sena (UBT) will contest on 21 seats, Congress on 17 and the NCP (SP) on 10 seats.However, as far as Shiv Sena (UBT) is concerned, the party had already decided the number of seats it would contest and also announced most of them, including Sangli, much in advance. Sanjay Raut had on March 27 released the first list of Shiv Sena (UBT) and announced the names of 17 party candidates.Maharashtra Congress leaders including state chief Nana Patole had then strongly objected to this unilateral Shiv Sena (UBT) announcement and had staked strong claim to the Sangli seat. However, Sanjay Raut had made it clear that his party would not budge and even claimed that seat-sharing talks were over. Today's formal announcement by the MVA partners shows that the Shiv Sena (UBT) managed to prevail over the allies.Sangli is a traditional bastion of the Congress, and it has won it continuously since Independence until 2014. But Patole tried to put up a brave face as he said Congress did not ""surrender"" but took a step back in the seat-sharing negotiations with its Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance partners as the talks could not go on indefinitely.""The deal has been finalised after consultations with the party high command. We tried our best to get the seats where we had good prospects of winning. But the talks cannot be stretched too far as the election process has already begun,"" Patole said.This even as the grand old party faces rebellion and has lost one key leader in the state. The Congress sacked senior party leader Sanjay Nirupam after he openly rebelled against the leadership over ""surrender"" to Shiv Sena (UBT).On the Sangli unit of Congress calling a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the future course of action, he said it was done after taking his permission. As per Congress sources, the party's local leadership in Mumbai too was upset over the failure to get at least three out of six seats in the city.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections , the undivided Shiv Sena had contested 23 Lok Sabha seats and won 18. The NCP had contested 19 seats and had won 4, while the Congress contested 25 and won just 1.Clearly, based on these numbers, the Shiv Sena (UBT) had a rightful claim to maximum seats within the alliance. However, there is a difference between 2019 and 2024 for Uddhav's party. Most of the leaders who had won on the party ticket are now with the other faction, which is the official Shiv Sena, led by chief minister Eknath Shinde. Uddhav Thackeray has managed to get the seats of his choice based on 2019 performance, he now faces the challenge of proving that he is not the ""fake Shiv Sena"" as Prime Minister Modi claimed in one of his recent rallies in the state.","Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had the last laugh as the opposition's

'Conspired & concealed': What Delhi HC said while dismissing Arvind Kejriwal's arrest plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conspired-concealed-what-delhi-hc-said-while-dismissing-kejriwals-arrest-plea/articleshow/109162934.cms,"Here's what the court said while dismissing Kejriwal's plea:

On legality of arrest:

On approver's statement

On timing of Kejriwal's arrest

On electoral bonds:

There cannot be 'specific privilege'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday dismissed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's plea against the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) arrest and subsequent remand.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma held ED's arrest of CM Arvind Kejriwal valid and observed that the AAP convenor ""conspired"" and was actively involved in the ""use and concealment of proceeds of crime "".Delhi high court observed that material collected by the ED reveals Arvind Kejriwal conspired and was actively involved in the use and concealment of proceeds of crime. The court said that the central agency case also reveals that Kejriwal was involved in his personal capacity as well as convenor of AAP.The bench observed that Kejriwal was involved in the formulation of excise policy and used proceeds of crime. The court said he was also allegedly involved in demanding kickbacks.The high court observed that ED was able to place enough material and that it had gone through the statement which completes the chain and shows that money was sent to Goa elections.The court said that in the current case, among several statements, the statements of Raghav Magunta and Sarath Reddy are approver statements which were recorded under PMLA as well as Section 164 of the CrPC. Therefore, to cast doubt on the manner of the approver's statement would amount to casting aspersions on the Court and judge.The bench observed that the law of approver is over 100 years old and cannot be suggested that it was enacted to implicate Arvind Kejriwal.Justice Sharma observed that ED was in possession of enough material which led to Kejriwal's arrest. The court noted that the skipping of the probe by CM Kejriwal, and the delay caused by him also impacted those in judicial custody.On the timing of Kejriwal's arrest, the court observed that Delhi CM was arrested in the money laundering case, and the court had to examine his arrest and remand as per law irrespective of the timing of the elections.Court said Kejriwal's challenge to the timing of arrest before the national polls, in the absence of any mala fide intent on the part of the ED, is not sustainable. The high court said that Kejriwal would have known that Lok Sabha elections would be declared.Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Abhishek Manu Sighnvi had argued that the Delhi CM was arrested by ED to disrupt his political campaign ahead of the polls.On AAP's charges that an approver had donated to the BJP through electoral bonds and another joined the party which happens to be a BJP ally, the bench said it was not the court's concern on who gave a ticket for contesting election and who purchased the electoral bond.The court also said the investigating agency under criminal jurisprudence can't be directed to conduct a probe at the ""convenience of a person"". However, the court said Kejriwal will have the right to cross-examine the witnesses.Justice Sharma observed that political considerations cannot be brought before the court ""as they are not relevant"".""When confronted with cases involving political figures, the judiciary relies on the Constitution and that is the only paramount consideration before this court.. Political considerations and equations cannot be brought before a court as they are not relevant to the legal process,"" court said.She said the present case is not a case ""between the central government and Kejriwal but between Kejriwal and the ED"".On the contention that the Delhi CM could have been questioned through the video conferencing is to be rejected, the court said it is ""not for the accused to decide how the investigation is to be done"".It observed that it cannot be as per the convenience of the accused.""This court won't set two sets of laws- One for the commons and the other for the public servants. There cannot be any specific privilege for anyone including the chief minister"", said Delhi high court.The court must remain vigilant that it is not influenced by any extraneous factors. We are concerned with constitutional morality, not political morality, she said.Kejriwal was sent to judicial custody in the case on April 1 after he was produced in Delhi's Rouse Avenue court on the expiry of ED's custody. The ED arrested Arvind Kejriwal on March 21 in the alleged money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy.","Delhi high court dismissed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's plea against ED's

He stated that this election would decide if ""we are achieving growth or moving towards downfall"".Raj announced his support while addressing a large crowd of MNS supporters gathered at Dadar’s Shivaji Park to attend the party's annual rally on the occasion of Gudi Padwa.Raj Thackeray indicated that his party may not contest the coming parliament election, but asked his supporters to prepare themselves for the assembly election scheduled in October this year.On Monday, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed his confidence that Raj Thackeray was set to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and would declare his support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Raj Thackeray had aggressively campaigned against the BJP during the last parliamentary election in 2019.While addressing his supporters on Monday, Raj Thackeray took a dig at his cousin and Shiv Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray, by stating that he always praised and congratulated the BJP for their good deeds. He said, “I never made personal comments, unlike Sanjay Raut and Uddhav Thackeray. My criticism was always issue-based.” He affirmed that he stands by the critical comment or statement he made in the past about his new alliance partners.Raj mentioned that he had been receiving proposals from Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for some time but lacked clarity. Therefore, he “called Amit Shah (Senior BJP leader and Home Minister)"" and met him to discuss the matter before further discussing the issue with Shinde and Fadnavis and making any announcement.Raj Thackeray stated that he was never interested in seat-sharing talks. He also said that he would remain the chief of the party he formed and would not head any other party.Around two decades ago, Thackeray left Shiv Sena and formed the MNS, focusing on local employment. In 2008, his party workers beat up a North Indian candidate who came to the state to appear for the railway recruitment exam, and in 2009, his party performed well, securing 13 assembly seats. However, their success dwindled, winning only one seat in the 2014 elections out of 232 contested. He had campaigned against the BJP during the 2019 parliamentary election, mainly against Narendra Modi and Amit Shah although his party had not contested the election.

KOZHIKODE: The small village of Muthuvallur in Kerala 's Muslim-majority district of Malappuram has scripted a heart-warming tale of communal harmony over the renovation of a 400-year-old Durga temple, reaffirming in this Ramzan season a centuries-long tradition of Hindu-Muslim generosity centred on places of worship.Muthuvallur Sree Durga Bhagavathy Temple, near Kondotty, stands out as an exemplary symbol of the syncretism, with the first phase of its renovation complete and the idol-installation ceremony set for May.The religious camaraderie has been evident through the temple renovation since 2015 in which Muslims contributed generously. Continuing with the tradition, the shrine authorities have again sought the help of people across religious divides for next month's installation of the new idol to replace one that was broken decades ago. A temple brochure is a testament to communal amity.A brochure brought out by temple authorities on May 7-9 idol installation is testament to communal amity. It prominently features photos of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) chief Panakkad Sadikkali Shihab Thangal (the qazi of hundreds of mosques in state and beyond), and temple thantri (vedic head) Thekkiniyedathu Tharananellur Padmanabhan Unni Namboodiripad. The temple, which comes under state-run Malabar Devaswom Board, is located in a predominantly Muslim neighbourhood. Muslims’ involvement in its conservation included copper-plating of the dome some years back.“As thantri, I reached out to the Muslim community and its leaders, including Thangal. Cooperation and goodwill cutting across religious lines is required for the temple. We received them in plenty,” said Namboodiripad, who is thantri of several temples across Malabar.Thangal told TOI that in a community where people live in harmony, it was natural to help each other, even in matters concerning faith and places of worship. Thangal even visited the temple at an event organised in 2023 to raise funds for renovation. There, a state Haj committee member, KP Sulaiman Haji, donated Rs 1 lakh.A “message of love” from the thantri addressed to IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty read out at a temple function on March 30 recounted its history steeped in religious camaraderie.According to the message, people of Kondotty once had to walk a long way to Tirurangadi for Friday prayers, with many often missing it as they could not reach in time. They decided then that it will be better to build a mosque and approached family of Thalayur Moosad, who owned the temple. The temple owners readily handed over land for the current Pazhayangadi mosque, which was built in the 18th century.According to temple committee president Chandran P, Muslims have contributed a major chunk of the Rs 38 lakh spent on the temple’s renovation in past few years, besides providing construction material and other aid. “When we approach them for anything connected to the temple, they extended full cooperation,” Chandran said. Muslims have also been providing vegetables for temple festivals. Vinaya Raj, a member of the Thalayur family, held up division-free Muthuvallur as a model for the country.","Muthuvallur Sree Durga Bhagavathy Temple, near Kondotty, stands out as an

NEW DELHI: With less than a fortnight to go for the polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday intensified the campaign trail for the BJP in Tamil Nadu. The Prime Minister is on his seventh visit to the state this year and the first after the 'Katchatheevu' issue was flagged by the BJP.Amid chants of ‘veendum meendum Modi ( We want Modi again),’ Prime Minister held a massive roadshow along with BJP state president K Annamalai and three BJP candidates contesting in Chennai such as Tamizhisai Soundararajan , Vinoj P Selvam and Paul Kanagaraj.The PM during his visit is expected to hold public rallies and roadshows in Vellore, Nilgiris, Perambalur, Virudhunagar in support of BJP and NDA candidates contesting under the alliance.The state, which will see all its 39 seats go to polls in a single phase on April 19, has witnessed high-profile visits from senior leaders of the BJP. Over the weekend, party national president JP Nadda, who was on a whirlwind tour, campaigned and held roadshows in the state after the Madras HC overruled police objections. Other leaders of the high command, who visited the state include the likes of union ministers Rajnath Singh, Hardeep Singh Puri, and Anurag Singh Thakur.The Prime Minister’s visit also comes amid claims by the ruling DMK that the visits ,if anything ,‘would benefit the DMK.’ However, a closer look at the Prime Minister’s itinerary in the coming days in the state makes it evident that the BJP is targeting constituencies where they see an opportunity to make inroads or, at the very least, fit in as the second-largest party in seats traditionally dominated by either of the Dravidian parties.In South Chennai, the BJP, the party has a history of fielding candidates since the 1991 Lok Sabha elections. BJP’s Tamizh Isai Soundarajan, who resigned from her constitutional post as governor of Telangana to contest electoral politics is pitted against Tamizhachi Thangapandian of the DMK and AIADMK ’s J Jayavardhan, son of former minister D Jayakumar.The Prime Minister is scheduled to campaign for Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai and L Murugan in the Nilgiri constituency on April 10. Coimbatore holds a significant place for the BJP, having fielded candidates there since 1989. Despite facing initial challenges with a low vote share in 1989, the party managed to secure victories in 1998 and 1999 with substantial vote percentages. This time, the DMK has fielded former mayor Ganapathi Rajkumar while the AIADMK has nominated Singai G. Ramachandran against BJP's Annamalai.Nilgiris, once a stronghold for the BJP in the late 1990s, saw the party win seats in the 1998 and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. However, its vote share dwindled in subsequent years, and the party did not field candidates in the following elections. This time, union minister of state, L Murugan from the BJP will face off against DMK's A Raja and Lokesh Tamizh Selvan from the AIADMK in Nilgiris.Virudhunagar and Perambalur are set to be in spotlight as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit these constituencies. Radhika Sarathkumar, wife of actor-turned-politician Sarathkumar, is contesting from Virudhunagar. While Paarivendhar, who previously won on a DMK ticket is now running on a BJP ticket and is contesting from Perambalur.Perambalur has historically not favored the BJP, with the party only fielding a candidate in 2014, when Paarivendhar secured 23.2 percent of votes. This time, Arun Nehru from the DMK and N D Chandramohan from the AIADMK are contesting against Paarivendhar.Similarly, the BJP lacks a strong foothold in the Vellore constituency. In the 2014 elections, they managed to secure 33.26 percent of the votes, largely attributed to Shanmugam, who is now contesting on the BJP symbol. He is pitted against DMK's Kathir Anand and S Pasupathi from the AIADMK.While in Virudhunagar, the BJP has fielded a candidate for the second time since its establishment in 2009. BJP's Radhika Sarathkumar will contest against B Manickam Tagore from Congress and Vijaya Prabhakaran, son of late DMDK leader Vijayakanth.Tamil Nadu stands out as a key state in sending a significant number of MPs to the Lok Sabha. With Uttar Pradesh reaching its peak in BJP representation and Maharashtra undergoing notable political shifts, Tamil Nadu remains a stronghold for regional parties since 1967, with no national party able to establish a strong presence.","The Prime Minister is on his seventh visit to the state this year and the first

"Kotia, where most say they vote in two states",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kotia-where-most-say-they-vote-in-two-states/articleshow/109177573.cms,"Voters in Kotia along Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border have been caught in a decades-long territorial dispute between the two states. But they aren’t complaining. Call it a case of having the best of both worlds or having your cake and eating it too but Kotia voters say they enjoy a rare privilege — the right to cast votes in two states.Over 2,500 electors of the 21 tribal villages hold voter IDs, ration cards, and even pension cards of both states as they fall under two Lok Sabha constituencies: Araku in Andhra and Koraput in Odisha.In 1968, Odisha moved SC laying claim to the villages. The court, however, ruled that interstate boundary issues fall outside its jurisdiction and can only be resolved by Parliament. Consequently, a permanent injunction was imposed, restraining either of the states from taking any action.However, when asked about the double voting rights, Andhra’s CEO Mukesh Kumar Meena called it illegal. “One person can cast only one vote at one location. Enrolment in two states is illegal. One should cancel the registration in one state to enrol in another,” he said.Nevertheless, the big question these electors face this time is which state they will vote in, as both Araku and Koraput go to polls on May 13.To get a feel of the geopolitical complexities and the voter pulse, TOI visited this cluster. Here’s the tug-of-war: Andhra claims the villages belong to its ParvathipuramManyam district, while Odisha asserts they lie in Koraput. Land surveys, records, and various forms of evidence fuel arguments from both sides vying for control. Development initiatives, political disputes, and resource allocation further complicate matters.In the run-up to elections, debates here centre around the contrasting approaches of the two states — Odisha’s infrastructure push versus Andhra’s welfare programmes. Odisha has made significant inroads, cementing its presence with concrete roads connecting villages to Kotia, the main panchayat. It has also established schools, a primary health centre, and an Indian Reserve Battalion outpost. Andhra, meanwhile, is focusing on financial aid through welfare schemes. This becomes evident while traversing from Salur in Andhra towards Kotia, as one nears the Odisha border.While voters residing downhill seem to identify more closely with Andhra, those uphill may favour Odisha. But, generally, villagers, who eke out a living cultivating millets and some paddy on the rugged slopes of the Eastern Ghats, feel they hold the upper hand as dual identity cards grant them access to benefits of both the states.For instance, Chodipalli Latchayya, a resident of Dhulibhadra hamlet in Salur mandal, Andhra, possesses a ration card under this identity. He also doubles up as Latchayya Pangi on another ration card in Odisha’s Pottangi block, Koraput. Similarly, Gemele Kati, who enjoys “voting rights” in both the states, has an Aadhaar card issued on an Andhra address, and is seeking a pension based on that.Villages too have dual official names. “Ganjaeipadar” in Odisha becomes “Ganjaibhadra” in Andhra, influenced by Telugu. Similarly, “Nerallavalasa” in Andhra becomes “Naradbalsa” in Odisha, and “Pattuchenneru” becomes “Phatuseneri”.When asked where they would vote, residents of Nerallavalasa and Thadivalsa — two of the 21 disputed villages — picked Andhra’s booth as the state offers more welfare schemes. Andhra provides a monthly welfare pension of Rs 3,000 compared to Odisha’s Rs 500. Andhra’s incentives, ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh per family per year, are a big draw.In the Kotia cluster, consisting of tribals from Konda Dora, Mooka Dora, Gadaba, and Jatapu communities, some communicate in Telugu and Odia, but most speak the ‘Kui’ dialect.Vanthala Sana, 60, from Nerellavalasa village under Sarika panchayat, said the dispute is only between the states, not people. “We receive more benefits from Andhra; I will vote at an Andhra booth,” she added.Abhi Gemel, who too receives benefits from both the states, said he would support Odisha as their culture is closer to that of the tribals of Koraput. However, the benefits have not translated into uplift. Most villagers are illiterate or dropouts, which is reflected in the low number of residents securing govt jobs in either state.","21 tribal villages along Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border have been caught in a

Lok Sabha polls: Minister hopes climate won’t change here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-minister-hopes-climate-wont-change-here/articleshow/109176912.cms,"Campaigning for Lok Sabha elections has pitchforked Bhupender Yadav , Union environment minister, BJP’s key organisation man and backroom strategist, to the frontlines in Rajasthan ’s Alwar constituency , known as much for lakes, Neemrana and Sariska’s tigers as it is for factories turning out cars, tractors and liquor.Less than 10 days from the first phase of polling — also his debut as a Lok Sabha candidate — Bhupender addresses close to 40 corner meetings a day, diving into Bhiwadi’s industrial townships and their neighbourhood villages.At every pit stop, he begins by highlighting Modi govt ’s assertive decision-making, citing Ram Mandir construction and abrogation of Article 370 as examples. He quickly moves on to the region’s water crisis, telling the motley crowds in housing societies and temple complexes that his development agenda for east Rajasthan’s industrial hub will marry PM Modi’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’.“Drinking water supply and waste water disposal are crucial issues affecting this area. Congress’s corrupt regime of the last five years (Ashok Gehlot-led Cong govt) did not allow the Union govt’s Jal Shakti Mission to be implemented. I will work with Centre and state govts of Haryana and Rajasthan to resolve this,” Bhupender says.At the western end of Alwar constituency, in Rajgarh-Lakshmangarh, Congress’s Mundawar legislator and now its LS candidate, Lalit Yadav, addresses similar public meetings in largely rural settings. He stresses his local connect while branding Bhupender an “outsider” from Haryana.Addressing swathes of farmers and local youths in an assembly segment that has remained loyal to Congress over the past two decades, the 34-year-old arts graduate accuses Bhupender of making hollow claims. The detailed project report of the plan to lay water pipelines between Haryana and Rajasthan, Lalit claims, does not exist.He also plays on the caste arithmetic, telling his audience that Bhupender didn’t support the region’s demand for the Ahir Regiment in the Army (locals had blocked the Delhi-Gurgaon highway in Feb 2022 to press for it). Alwar is dominated by Ahirs (synonymous with Yadavs), who displayed their valour in the battle of Rezang La (1962). They count Rao Tula Ram, one of the heroes of 1857, among their own.With just over a week remaining for polling day, campaigning is at fever pitch. Both sides are treating it as a prestige battle. Former Alwar MP and now Tijara MLA, Mahant Balak Nath, accompanies Bhupender around town to quell rumours he’s unhappy at being denied a ticket. Rajasthan chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma and his deputy Diya Kumari will also throw in their weight behind Bhupender, as will Home minister Amit Shah, who is scheduled to campaign for him on April 13. BJP believes Shah’s rally will bump up its already bright prospects.Lalit’s campaign may be short onresources, but it has also drawn INDIA bloc’s star campaigners. Sachin Pilot addressed a large rally in his support in Kishangarh Bas on Monday, while SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are expected to follow suit.BSP’s Fazal Hussain could spoil Lalit’s chances, although he is considered a distant third in the race.","Bhupender Yadav, Union environment minister, BJP’s key organisation man and

No easy pickings in Bengal’s tea junction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-easy-pickings-in-bengals-tea-junction/articleshow/109175988.cms,"A 30km drive from New Jalpaiguri station takes a tourist to Bhorer Alo, a govt tourist estate at Gajoldoba in north Bengal ’s Dooars. Gajoldoba, where the first commercial tea estate was set up in 1874-75, is a tourist hot spot. Gajoldoba is also a microcosm of a Hills society in the throes of change — from tea to tourism, the region’s demography, the changing aspirations of youth and, consequently, the politics of a region known for the world’s finest brew: Darjeeling , Terai and Dooars — and Jalpaiguri, Alipurduars and Darjeeling, the three LS seats that vote on April 19 and April 26.One huge issue is climate change , and its effect on the region’s 303 tea estates: a production and export slump.“The climate change has been drastic,” said J C Pande, chairman of Indian Tea Association, Dooars chapter. “Rainfall is sporadic, untimely and temperatures have risen, resulting in poor yield. If you want to beat that, you need to use more chemicals, which will leave produce unsold.In addition, the region’s organised tea sector has come under threat from Bought Leaf Factories (BLF), which procure tea leaves from tea grown on erstwhile farmlands. Farmers took to growing tea on farmlands after they started getting low prices on food crops. This forced many tea estates to shut, adding to the uncertainty of the three lakh plantation workers.There are more than 50,000 small tea gardens in north Bengal, spread over Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and North Dinajpur districts.Political parties are now trying to woo people from a region in transition. In Darjeeling, it’s essentially going to be a three-cornered contest between second-time BJP candidate Raju Bista, Trinamool’s Gopal Lama and Munish Tamang from the Congress-Hamro Party combine. But Bishnu Prasad Sharma, a BJP MLA from Kurseong who’s thrown his hat into the ring as an independent, may queer the pitch.In Alipurduars, BJP candidate Manoj Tigga and Trinamool’s Prakash Chik Baraik are leading roadshows in the foothills. Jalpaiguri is looking at a two-pronged fight between BJP’s Jayanta Roy and TMC’s Nirmal Chandra Ray.“Tea and cinchona plantation workers are the backbone of the economy in Darjeeling, Terai and the Dooars,” said Bista. “Despite their immense significance for the overall wellbeing of our region, plantation workers have remained economically marginalised.”Trinamool-backed trade union leader Swapan Sarkar said wages had improved under the current govt. “The daily wage was Rs 67 a day under the Left. It has increased to Rs 250,” Sarkar said.The downturn in the region’s tea gardens has prompted planters to downsize, leading workers to move out. The exodus of jobless workers, mostly migrants from the Chhotanagpur Plateau, has led to a conflict of interest with those engaged in farming, or other odd jobs.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee tried to address the issue by announcing land pattas to tea workers within closed gardens. But there were few takers, as the workers possessed much more land within the gardens than she promised, said Mani Kumar Darnal, general secretary of the Congress-affiliated National Union of Plantation Workers. “Once they take the patta for five decimals, they will have to release their extra land,” he explained.“We want deed papers for the land we already possess. Anything below that is unacceptable,” said a plantation worker at Lakhipara tea estate.The crisis accentuated since the mid-90s, when the region witnessed a migration of “Bhupali” (Nepalese in Bhutan) population in 1994 to the foothills. Members of the Mech, Rava and Rajbanshi tribes, who stayed outside the gardens, felt threatened, with the displaced workers joining the labour market. The Hills and the foothills became a cauldron of identity politics. The Gorkha community won’t settle for anything less than Gorkhaland and ST status for 11 Gorkha tribes.The CM set up development boards for several communities, but it didn’t make much sense for the Hills population, who swore to achieve Gorkhaland and wanted BJP to live up to its promise of a permanent solution. PM Modi, in a recent meeting in Siliguri, urged Gorkhas to have patience, saying his govt was closer to finding this solution","Darjeeling, Terai and Dooars, the three LS seats that vote on April 19 and April

"UBT to contest 21 Maharashtra seats, Congress 17, NCP 10",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ubt-to-contest-21-maharashtra-seats-congress-17-ncp-10/articleshow/109174210.cms,"Not a surrender: Maha Cong; Pawar calls deal unanimous

MUMBAI: Maha Vikas Aghadi finalised on Tuesday its seat-sharing formula for all 48 LS seats in Maharashtra with Congress conceding two prime seats - Sangli and Bhiwandi - to its allies Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP). Sena (UBT) has got 21 seats, the biggest share, Congress 17 and NCP(SP) 10, reports Prafulla Marpakwar.With Congress also giving up its claim on Mumbai South Central, it will now contest only two of Mumbai's six seats, with four being fought by Uddhav's Sena.Though MPCC chief Nana Patole, legislature party leader Balasaheb Thorat and Congress negotiators were not in favour of conceding the seats, AICC had directed the state leadership to give up its claim ""in the larger interest of INDIA"".UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut declared the formula in the presence of Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar, Patole, Thorat, former CM Prithviraj Chavan and state NCP (SP) president Jayant Patil, among others.The Congress had been insisting on Sangli, Bhiwandi and Mumbai South Central all through the negotiations process which MVA began in December. But when talks were still on, Uddhav Thackeray last week unilaterally declared the candidature of Chandrahar Patil for Sangli and Anil Desai for Mumbai South Central while Sharad Pawar declared Suresh Mhatre as his nominee for Bhiwandi, leading to the state Congress lodging a strong protest and urging Thackeray in particular to reconsider his decision. When there was no response, the state leaders took up the matter with AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary KC Venugopal, who asked them to take a step back.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the undivided Shiv Sena had contested 23 seats, of which it won 18, while on the remaining it was either at number two or three. Therefore it was all along insisting on fighting 22 seats and has been able to secure 21. The Congress had contested 26 seats in 2019 and won just one, Chandrapur, where its nominee Balu Dhanorkar had defeated veteran BJP leader Hansraj Ahir.In 22 of the seats it lost, Congress was at number two, while the undivided NCP, which contested 22 seats, had won 4 and was at number two on 17.Sharad Pawar said the final formula has been arrived at after taking all constituents into confidence. “It is a unanimous decision. I am sure MVA workers will work wholeheartedly, our goal is to defeat the NDA led by Narendra Modi,” he said.Patole said, “We have given up two contentious seats (Sangli and Bhiwandi), but it is not a surrender. We took a step back in seat-sharing negotiations in the MVA as it was not possible to continue talks indefinitely. We did it in the larger interest of MVA as our goal is to defeat the NDA government. We will explain the situation to our workers in Sangli and Bhiwandi, I am sure they will listen to us.”Patole said the deal has the AICC’s approval. “We tried our best to get the seats where we had good prospects of winning, but talks could not be stretched too far as the election process has begun,” he added.According to reports, Mumbai Congress president Varsha Gaikwad has written to AICC general secretary KV Venugopal expressing concern over the Congress leadership’s failure to secure Sangli and Mumbai South Central seats for the party.Uddhav Thackeray had earlier said that whenever negotiations are in progress, there is a stage at which one has to stop further debate and take a decision. His party, he had said, had taken the decision to contest Sangli and Mumbai South Central and there was no going back.The four seats UBT Sena will contest in Mumbai are Mumbai South, South Central, North East and North West, while Congress will contest Mumbai North and North Central.","Maha Vikas Aghadi finalised on Tuesday its seat-sharing formula for all 48 LS

Voters don't need to know every detail of a neta's assets: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voters-dont-need-to-know-every-detail-of-a-netas-assets-sc/articleshow/109174147.cms,"Non-disclosure of every asset won’t amount to a defect: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday held that non-disclosure of all assets owned by an electoral candidate would not amount to a defect and such assets should be of substantial value to attract invalidation of , while also saying that the right of voters to know has to be balanced with the right to privacy of candidates.It set aside Gauhati high court's order invalidating the election of an independent candidate, Karikho Kri, to Arunachal Pradesh 's assembly for not declaring three vehicles registered in the names of his wife and son.It said the MLA had declared assets of Rs 8.4 crore and value of the vehicles was minuscule compared to his assets and “non-disclosure cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be treated as an attempt on his part to unduly influence voters”. It also noted that the vehicles were already gifted or sold by him at the time of filing nomination and only transfer of ownership remained to be done.A bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Sanjay Kumar said there was no absolute mandate that every non-disclosure, irrespective of its gravity and impact, will automatically amount to a substantial defect, materially affecting the result of elections or amounting to “undue influence” so as to qualify as a corrupt practice.Balancing right of voters to know with right to privacy of a candidate, the bench said, “Though it has been strenuously contended before us that the voters’ right to know is absolute and a candidate contesting the election must be forthright about all his particulars, we are not inclined to accept the blanket proposition that a candidate is required to lay his life out threadbare for examination by the electorate. His right to privacy will still survive as regards matters that are of no concern to voters or are irrelevant to his candidature for public office.”Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Kumar said, “In that respect, non-disclosure of each and every asset owned by a candidate will not amount to a defect, much less, a defect of a substantial character. It is not necessary that a candidate declare every item of movable property that he or his dependent family mem-bers own, such as clothing, shoes, crockery, stationery and furniture, etc, unless the same is of such value as to constitute a sizeable asset in itself or reflect upon his candidature, in terms of his lifestyle, and require to be disclosed.”The bench said there could be no hard and fast or straitjacketed rule as to when non-disclosure of a particular movable asset by a candidate will amount to a defect of a substantial character. Elucidating it with an example, court said if a candidate and his family own several high-priced watches, then they have to be disclosed as they constitute an asset of high value and also reflect upon his lavish lifestyle.“Suppression of the same will constitute undue influence upon voters as that relevant information about the candidate is being kept away from them. However, if a candidate and his family members each own a simple watch, which is not highly priced, suppression of the value of such watches may not amount to a defect at all,” it said.Court said mere non-compliance or breach of the Constitution or statutory provisions will not result in invalidating elections and permission to quash poll results can be given only if such breach or non- observance was determined to have materially affected the result.","Non-disclosure of all assets owned by an electoral candidate would not amount to

"Tamil Nadu Lok Sabha polls: In Coimbatore, BJP has high hopes on Annamalai to lead the ‘change’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-lok-sabha-polls-in-coimbatore-bjp-has-high-hopes-on-annamalai-to-lead-the-change/articleshow/109107952.cms,"BJP vs DMK vs AIADMK

All is not well on the business front

NEW DELHI: In what will be a riveting battle for the prized Lok Sabha seat of the 'Manchester of south India’ - Coimbatore, the BJP , led by Prime Minister Modi , has placed all bets on its state president, K Annamalai's popularity and profile to lead the 'change from Coimbatore' in Tamil Nadu In the first media interview to a regional outlet ahead of the polls, the Prime Minister, expecting the 'tables to turn' in Tamil Nadu, argued that the BJP was the preferred party of choice for youngsters like Annamalai, who are not swayed by 'money and corruption.' The Prime Minister, also endorsing the ex-IPS officer’s candidature, took part in the culmination of his 'En Makal En Yatra' at Palladam, not very far from Coimbatore.Modi held the longest roadshow in the constituency with Annamalai and paid obeisance to the victims of the 1998 blast that happened during LK Advani’s visit - after which the constituency has featured importantly in BJP’s electoral thinking in the region.Speaking about the significance of the Prime Minister’s visit and roadshow in Coimbatore ahead of the , a BJP worker recalled that ‘Modi’s first visit after assuming office as Prime Minister in 2014 was to Coimbatore.’BJP’s Tamil Nadu chief Annamalai, who of late has made news more often than not, is pitted against IT wing head, Singai Ramachandran of the AIADMK; former Mayor of Coimbatore, Ganapathy P Raj Kumar, who had joined the DMK after leaving the AIADMK in 2020; and NTK’s Kalamani Jeganathan.Though widely considered an AIADMK stronghold, the BJP is betting that the odds are in its favor this time. BJP’s optimism is buoyed by the fact the constituency is communally sensitive and industrially rich with a fair north Indian workforce. Soon after the blasts during Advani’s visit in 1998, BJP’s C P Radhakrishnan won the seat in 1998 and 1999. In the state elections of 2021, BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan defeated MNM’s Kamal Hassan in Coimbatore to be among the four lawmakers for the saffron party in the state assembly. The popular actor and politician is now leading a campaign for the DMK across the state after deciding to merge his party with the latter.Anticipating a tough fight, DMK this time around has decided to go against its decade-old seat-sharing agreement with the CPM. DMK’s Ganapathy Raj Kumar will contest in incumbent MP Natrajan’s place. The DMK candidate is also expected to get a high-profile endorsement by Chief minister Stalin and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who will head a INDIA bloc rally in Coimbatore on April 12, a week ahead of the polls.What makes the battle all the more interesting is the profile of the candidates. All three candidates share the distinction of being graduates of the same popular college body in the city. While Annamalai and G. Singai Ramachandran are also alumni of the IIM. The AIADMK candidate’s father was once elected a state legislator from Singanallur in Coimbatore.The business community constitutes an important part of the electorate. Known to be one of the fastest-growing tier-two cities, Coimbatore has around 25,000 micro , small, and medium enterprises (MSME).Recently, the MSMEs have raised concerns with the union govt’s decision to stop the subsidy given to them and have demanded a reduction of GST for the MSMEs. There has been a cry from the spinning mills , textile industries across the district urging the central and state govts to reduce raw material prices and power tariff.On the IT front however, the city looks all set for a boom especially after recent investments announced during the recently concluded Global Investors Meet (GIM).Annamalai addressing a business community accused the state govt of not securing enough investments as much as the state govts of UP and Gujarat could seal for their states.During his campaign, Singai G Ramachandran of the AIADMK promised to make the city a start-up & IT hub , and bring infrastructure development. DMK's Ganapathy P Raj Kumar is campaigning on the plank of expediting the Metro project, providing better connectivity in terms of air and rail. While Annamalai has promised more investment, better law & order, and said there are detailed plans that will come out along with 'separate manifestos’ prepared for each constituency.Meanwhile, the ruling DMK, confident of another landslide victory, has accused PM Modi of being ‘a part-time politician,’ and selectively visiting Tamil Nadu only to suit his electoral pursuits. Chief minister Stalin in a recent interview claimed that the Prime Minister’s visit, if anything, will ‘benefit the DMK.’The electorate on April 19 and ultimately the results on June 4 will tell how much of these claims for and against each other have really made an impact on the minds of the voters.Notwithstanding the chaos, the keenly watched contest promises to be an intense battle with AIADMK vying to defend its bastion, the DMK wanting to undo its 2014 poll nightmare of ending up third, and the BJP looking to embark on its grand mission Tamil Nadu beginning from Coimbatore.","BJP's Tamil Nadu chief, K Annamalai, is pitted against IT wing head, Singai
