Uniform Civil Code can be prepared in 2 days: Ambedkar in 1951,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-civil-code-can-be-prepared-in-2-days-ambedkar-in-1951/articleshow/112580118.cms,"No political party in power took this short step despite SC goading

NEW DELHI: When the Constitution was just a year-old, law minister B R Ambedkar had stoically met the charge that the Hindu Code Bill , 1951, was communal in nature as it aimed to codify the personal law of one religious community leaving aside the Muslims, Parsis, Jews and Christians.On Feb 6, 1951, the architect of the Constitution had countered the members of Parliament who had sought a Uniform Civil Code by saying, “If they want a Civil Code, do they think that it will take very long to have a Civil Code?” He probably had in mind the mandate of Article 44 , which said - “The State shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code…”.Ambedkar had said, “Probably the underlying motive why they have made this suggestion is this. As it has taken four or five years to draft the Hindu Code they will probably take ten years to draft a Civil Code. I would like to tell them that the Civil Code is there. If they want it, it can be placed before the House within two days. If they are ready and willing to swallow it, we can pass it in this House in half an hour.” He said by carrying out minor amendments to Indian Succession Act, 1925, and the Special Marriage Act, 1872, “you can have a Civil Code tomorrow”.Ambedkar resigned as law minister in October 1951. Codification of Hindu personal law was done in 1956, preceded by heated debate in Parliament. ‘ Muslim community is not ready for UCC’ argument came from noted lawyer and Muslim League member from West Bengal, Naziruddin Ahmad. Many Hindu MPs opposed the Hindu Code Bill, 1955, and asked why similar simultaneous exercise is not undertaken for Muslims and Christians.Secularistic conservatism towards reforming Muslim personal laws made PM Jawaharlal Nehru adopt Naziruddin Ahmed’s excuse - “The Muslim Community is not ready”. Ridiculing Nehru, MP J B Kriplani said, ”It is not the (Hindu) Mahasabhites who alone are communal; it is the government also that is communal, whatever it may say. It is passing a communal measure. I charge you with communalism because you are bringing forward a law about monogamy only for Hindu community. Take it from me that the Muslim community is prepared to have it but you are not brave enough to do it… If you want to have (provision of divorce) for Hindu community, have it; but have it for the Catholic community also.”It took the Supreme Court 30 years to notice political prevarication on implementation of Article 44. In the 1995 Shah Bano case, the SC said, ""It is also a matter of regret that Article 44 of our Constitution has remained a dead letter… A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country.""The SC in Sarla Mudgal case (1995) said, “When more than 80% of the citizens have already been brought under the codified personal law, there is no justification whatsoever to keep in abeyance, any more, the introduction of 'uniform civil code' for all citizens in the territory of India.”In the Lily Thomas case [2000 (6) SCC 224], SC noted that the government, in two affidavits of August and December 1996, had said it would take steps to frame a uniform code only if the communities which desired such a code approached the government and took the initiative themselves in the matter. It was a refined version of the ‘Muslim community not ready’ argument of 1955.Today, when every legislative reform - citizenship, agriculture, illegal migration - is opposed with agitation on communal lines, the PM has a difficult task to bring in a uniform civil code. Renaming it as secular civil code will not change ground realities.","Law minister B R Ambedkar had stoically met the charge that the Hindu Code Bill, 1951, was communal in nature.

Government allays fears of significant mpox surge in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-allays-fears-of-significant-mpox-surge-in-india/articleshow/112579767.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has reported 30 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox since January 2022: the latest being a case from the state of Kerala.According to the sources in the Union health ministry , there hasn't been any significant surge in cases of the infectious viral disease and the future risk of surge also remains low.Nonetheless, a senior official who did not want to be quoted said, government is mulling steps for extra-vigil in view of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recent decision to declare the infectious disease a public health emergency of international concern.Steps being mulled include increased vigilance at airports and seaports since most of the cases reported so far had a history of travel to countries where the cases are significantly higher.According to WHO, monkeypox is a viral zoonosis - a virus transmitted to humans from animals - with symptoms like smallpox although clinically less severe. Monkeypox typically manifests itself with fever, rash and swollen lymph nodes and may lead to a range of medical complications.It is usually a self-limited disease with symptoms lasting for two to four weeks. The 'Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease' issued by the Centre, in 2022 stated that human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through large respiratory droplets generally requiring prolonged close contact. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or lesions, and indirect contact with lesion material such as through contaminated clothing or linen of an infected person.Animal-to-human transmission may occur by bite or scratch of infected animals or through bush meat preparation. The incubation period is usually from six to 13 days and the case fatality rate of monkeypox has historically ranged up to 11 per cent in the general population and higher among children. In recent times, the case fatality rate has been around three to six per cent. The symptoms include lesions which usually begin within one to three days from the onset of fever, lasting for around two to four weeks and are often described as painful until the healing phase when they become itchy.",India has reported 30 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox since January 2022. The latest was a case from the state of Kerala.

BJP faces tough test in 2-match series: Resurgent Congress will try to wrest Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-faces-tough-test-in-2-match-series-resurgent-congress-will-try-to-wrest-haryana/articleshow/112576104.cms,"NEW DELHI: Haryana will be a keenly watched battle where a resurgent Congress will seek to oust BJP after a decade out of power in what was its bastion till the advent of Narendra Modi on the national scene.BJP spotted signs of strong anti-incumbency , built around jobs, prices and law and order, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and effected correctives by replacing chief minister M L Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini .But the party could not stave off the Congress which won five of the ten seats, a major shift after having been reduced to zero in 2019 and just one in 2014.The immediate backdrop of the battle is the reason why Congress is gung ho about its prospects, with party leaders even predicting a landslide.After Congress lost the assembly owing to decade-long anti-incumbency barely months after Modi wave installed the BJP government at the Centre, the state has been decoupled from the central scene. Barely had the state voted overwhelmingly for BJP in the post-Pulwama 2019 Lok Sabha elections that it nearly shocked the party in vidhan sabha. BJP was stopped at 40 seats and had to tie up with JJP to form the government. This time, Congress goes into the polls having won half of the Lok Sabha seats, and that too in an election where polarising factors like Ayodhya were in full play.Post-2024, the main rivals have been trying to adjust the factors to their advantage. Congress led by Bhupinder Hooda has been on a non-stop campaign across the state, beefed up by statewide yatra by Deepender Hooda and a separate one focussed on urban seats by senior MP and Dalit face Kumari Selja. Congress is a divided house in the state, but insiders exude confidence that it would not come in the way of aggregating the voters for the party.BJP, on the other hand, is banking on the new variable that it inserted in the Haryana politics in 2014 with the formulation ""35 qaum ka chunav"" - an allusion to the strategy of polarisation against the dominant Jat community. It served it well in 2014 assembly polls and then 2019, and its traces can be found in its continuing influence over Yadav and Punjabi community and strength in the urban centres. The idea behind replacing Khattar with OBC Nayab Saini is also designed as part of the same plan.However, Congress and Hooda have claimed that the BJP gambit would be a non-starter and the state is united against the BJP's failure on jobs, prices, law and order, and governance. The party's confidence is evident from its refusal to tie up with AAP or any other party, while it has been making populist promises to cut household spendings like subsidised LPG. Agniveer is another source of resentment Congress is pressing on.Ultimately, BJP is relying on a multi-cornered contest and the presence of JJP, INLD and AAP splitting the anti-incumbency votes. But Hooda said the Lok Sabha polls have proven that Haryana assembly will be a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress, and there is no space for a third player, unlike 2019 when the INLD splinter outfit led by Dushyant Chautala hurt the Congress.BJP has also been preparing to shore up its organisational set-up down to the booth level, and started preparations in earnest immediately after the Lok Sabha results on June 4. Home minister Amit Shah has visited the state twice and also launched the party campaign.","Haryana will be a keenly watched battle where a resurgent Congress will seek to oust BJP.

Maha-Metro has already started the pre-bid activities and preparation of Tender documents.The Swargate to Katraj Underground Line Extension of the existing PCMC-Swargate Metro Line of Pune Metro Phase-I project was approved by the Cabinet on Friday.This new extension is known as the Line-l B extension and will span 5.46 km and will include three underground stations, connecting key areas such as Market Yard, Bibwewadi, Balaji Nagar, and the Katraj suburbs.The project, aimed at providing seamless connectivity in Pune, is set to be completed by February 2029.The estimated cost of the project is Rs 2,954.53 crore, with funding to be equally shared by the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra, along with contributions from bilateral agencies, etc.This extension will integrate with the Swargate Multimodal Hub, which includes the Metro Station, the MSRTC Bus Stand, and the PMPML Bus Stand, providing seamless connectivity for commuters within and outside Pune City. This extension will enhance connectivity between the southernmost part of Pune, the northern parts of Pune and the eastern and western regions via the District Court interchange station, providing seamless connectivity for commuting within and outside Pune City.The Swargate to Katraj Underground Line will significantly alleviate road traffic congestion and provide a safer, more comfortable travel experience by minimizing the risk of accidents, pollution, and travel time, thus supporting sustainable urban development.The new corridor will link various bus stops, railway stations, recreational centers like the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park,Taljaihillock (tekdi), malls, etc., various residential areas, educational institutions, colleges, and major business hubs. It will provide a faster and more economical transport option, benefiting thousands of daily commuters, especially students, small business owners and professionals traveling to offices and business centers. The projected daily ridership on the Swargate-Katraj Line for the years 2027, 2037, 2047, and 2057 is estimated to be 95,000,1.58 lakh, 1.87 lakh, and 1.97 lakh passengers, respectively.The project will be executed by Maha-Metro, which will oversee civil, electro-mechanical, and other associated facilities and works. Maha-Metro has already begun pre-bid activities and is preparing tender documents.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the proposal of Airports Authority of India (AAI) for development of New Civil Enclave at Bagdgora Airport, Siliguri, West Bengal at an estimated cost of Rs.1549 crore.The proposed terminal building will span 70,390 sqm and is designed to accommodate 3,000 peak hour passengers (PHP), with an annual capacity to handle 10 million passengers.Key components of the project include the construction of an Apron capable of accommodating 10 parking bays suitable for A-321 type aircraft, as well as two link taxiways and Multi-Level Car Parking.Emphasizing environmental responsibility, the Terminal Building will be a Green Building, integrating renewable energy sources and maximizing natural lighting to minimize ecological footprint.The New Civil Enclave at Bihta, Patna, Bihar will be developed at an estimated cost of Rs 1,413 crore.This infrastructure project represents a strategic move to address the anticipated saturation of capacity at Patna Airport. While AAI is already in the process of constructing a new terminal building at Patna Airport, further expansion is constrained by limited land availability.The proposed New Integrated Terminal Building at Bihta Airport spans 66,000 sqm and is designed to handle 3000 Peak Hour Passengers (PHP) and annually cater to 50 lakh passengers.This will be further expanded by another 50 Lakh whenever it is required and ultimate capacity would be one crore passengers per annum. Key components of the project include the construction of an Apron capable of accommodating 10 parking bays suitable for A-321/B-737-800/A-320 type aircraft, as well as two link taxiways.","PM Modi hailed the project and said it would enhance commuter experience and boost 'Ease of Living' Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced significant developments in India's transportation infrastructure.

"Pakistan ties in deep freeze, poll announcement won't matter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-ties-in-deep-freeze-poll-announcement-wont-matter/articleshow/112576435.cms,"NEW DELHI: The announcement of elections in J&K is unlikely to have any impact on India-Pakistan ties which remain in a deep freeze since India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state, or even well before that.With the Supreme Court having upheld the repeal of the special status, India believes the question about whether Pakistan has a locus standi in how the Indian govt chooses to run the internal affairs of what is now a Union Territory is already settled.On the limited issue of territory, both countries will continue to maintain their clearly stated and uncompromising positions.Islamabad, on the other hand, will continue to insist that elections and return to statehood, both of which the Supreme Court had sought in its ruling, cannot be a substitute to people's right to self-determination. However, delaying the elections any further would likely have been used by Pakistan to buttress the theory it has clung to that the situation in J&K isn't normal.SC's order asking for elections to be held could have allowed an opening for the two sides to work towards restoring at least a semblance of normalcy in the relationship but Islamabad has officially maintained there can be no forward movement till India reverses the revocation, rejecting calls from within Pakistan to resume trade ties with India.Unlike in the past, there's hardly any pressure on India from its western partners to engage Pakistan in the name of peace, allowing the Indian govt to resolutely maintain Pakistan must take tangible measures against cross-border terrorism for any dialogue to take place. That Pakistan complicated the relationship further by unilaterally recalling its high commissioner after the change in Kashmir's status has only worked in India's favour, justifying its position that any initiative for a breakthrough has to come from Islamabad.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif's elder brother Nawaz Sharif, whom Narendra Modi once called a ""friend"", did reach out with a message to seize the opportunity, after Indian PM won his third term in office, to ""shape the destiny of the two billion people of south Asia"" but for India it's more important that Pakistan first reinstate its high commissioner to set the ball of diplomacy rolling.In his response to Nawaz, Modi had spoken about the need to ensure the well-being and security of the people, underlining India's position that Islamabad has to first create an atmosphere free of terror for dialogue. The recent terror attacks have also exacerbated India's concerns about terrorism, as obvious from his message to the ""patrons of terrorism"" across the LoC that their sinister plan would not succeed. Naming Pakistan, Modi had said it had not learnt anything from history and was trying to remain relevant through terrorism and proxy war.",The announcement of elections in J&K is unlikely to have any impact on India- Pakistan ties which remain in a deep freeze. India believes the question about whether Pakistan has a locus standi in how the Indian govt chooses to run the internal affairs of what is now a Union Territory is already settled.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576677,imgsize-1682364,width-400,resizemode-4/112576677.jpg"

UDAIPUR: Protests and communal tension erupted Friday in Udaipur following the stabbing of a schoolboy by another from a different religion, shutting down markets amid stone-pelting, vehicle torchings and a mall rampage.A Class 10 student of Government Higher Secondary School Bhattyani Chauhatta in Girwa area stabbed his classmate with a knife over an old enmity around 10.30am.District education officer Lokesh Bharti said both minors were around 15 years old.The reason behind their dispute remains unknown. The attack occurred during an altercation outside school after lunch when one knifed the other two to three times in the thigh, Bharti added. The assailant has been detained and his father arrested, police said.The injured student is in ICU at a city hospital and stable, collector Arvind Poswal said while promising a ""thorough inquiry"" into the attack. Late Friday evening, local authorities suspended mobile internet in the city for 24 hours to check rumour-mongering and incendiary messages.As the school rushed the injured student to hospital, his family arrived there, followed by members of a religious organisation who started raising slogans. When the protesters swelled, more cops were deployed at the hospital.As word about the stabbing spread, protests erupted in other areas of the city late afternoon. More than a dozen vehicles were set ablaze.Most markets in the old city remained closed. Many organisations from the injured boy's community shut down shops in various areas. The situation gradually escalated into violence.An enraged mob vandalised shops and a mall in Chetak Circle area.Fire brigades were rushed in to douse the torched vehicles.Collector Poswal later invoked special provisions in Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita's (BNS) Section 163, which gives local authorities powers to crack down on nuisance or apprehended danger to maintain law and order. Udaipur ASP Umesh Ojha said more forces had been deployed in nearly all areas of the city to check further trouble.","Protests and communal tension erupt in Udaipur following the stabbing of a schoolboy by another from a different religion.

IIT-Bombay relaxes punishment of 8 over 'offensive' play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-bombay-relaxes-punishment-of-8-over-offensive-play/articleshow/112579328.cms,"MUMBAI: Two months after penalising eight students for staging an 'offensive' play - Raahovan - during the institute's Performance Arts Festival (PAF), IIT Bombay has relaxed the quantum of punishment imposed on them.After the appeal, the fine of four students, who graduated this year, has been brought down to half - from Rs 1.2 lakh to Rs 60,000. The permanent suspension from hostel facilities for four junior students has been reduced to six months.Most in the latter group, however, did not get any relaxation in their fine amount of Rs 40,000.PAF is an annual cultural event that was held in March this year, and the play was staged on the campus on March 31. The play, loosely based on the Ramayana , depicted the lead characters in a 'derogatory manner', claimed complaints from a section of students. The institute took action based on recommendations of a disciplinary action committee (DAC) after the complaints. The committee held a meeting in May, and the directive was passed in a letter dated June 4. Many found the penalties 'harsh'. The institute, however, allowed the students to appeal against the order. After the appeal, the punishments were relaxed in the first week of Aug.A source from campus said the junior students, though relieved with relaxation of the permanent suspension, got a raw deal in the episode.""They are not only paying the fine of Rs 40,000, but they will also have to rent out a place outside the campus for six months. The students are expected to pay hostel charges as part of their semester fees, and now the rent is an additional financial burden. They will also have to eat out as the directive mentions they will be suspended from all hostel facilities, including the mess,"" said the source.The students appealed to IIT Bombay's administration after they received the letters in June. A few institute professors and some alumni also came out in their support.The students apologised to the administration for unintentionally causing hurt to people's sentiments, said the source, adding that DAC, from the beginning, did not clarify what exactly was objectionable in the performance.'Loss of hostel residence facility for a definite period of time' has been listed as one of the 'major' disciplinary actions in the three categories enlisted in DAC rules. A senior institute official confirmed the quantum of punishment has been reduced but did not give details. Earlier, the institute had mentioned that the punishments will not affect the students' academic career.A video of the play had gone viral a few days after it was staged, sparking a debate on artistic freedom and hurting religious sentiments. The names of lead characters were slightly changed, and some found the portrayal of the lead characters, allegedly shown abusing each other, and the female lead praising the negative character in the video, offensive.","The fine of four students, who graduated this year, has been brought down to half.

Besides, the EC added, the high requirement of forces in J&K did not leave scope for adding Maharashtra in the schedule announced on Friday.Explaining why Maharashtra polls have not been timed along with Haryana elections, as was the case in the past, CEC Rajiv Kumar said the term of Haryana assembly is ending on November 3, 2024, while that of Maharashtra concludes only on November 26, 2024.Since J&K polls were due this time around and had to be held before September 30, Haryana had to be brought forward as EC would otherwise need to announce it in the midst of J&K poll. Had EC waited until after October 4, the time was not enough to have the new Haryana assembly in place before November 3. ""So the only option was to hold the J&K and Haryana polls together,"" the CEC said.A source said Maharashtra polls may be announced shortly after the assembly elections in J&K and Haryana are completed. In all probability, the assembly poll in Jharkhand, where the term of the current assembly is expiring on January 5, 2025, will be brought forward and synced with Maharashtra election.Addressing a press conference here, Kumar said heavy rains in Maharashtra had led to delays in updation of the voters list in the state, which is considered as a crucial step in the electoral process.""There was heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, booth level officers have to complete their work. There are several festivals too that have to be factored in.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the first big electoral faceoff between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with the Election Commission on Friday announcing dates for assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir The BJP has a lot at stake, especially in Haryana, where it is seeking a third term in office under chief minister Nayab Singh Saini - who replaced Manohar Lal Khattar in March this year.The fact that the BJP had to change its chief minister of nearly 9 years in an election year speaks volumes about the party's ground assessment of situation in the state.If the Lok Sabha election results in the state is any indication to go by, the BJP is on a sticky wicket. It's tally in the Lower House was reduced by half as the party managed to win only 5 of the 10 seats in Lok Sabha elections. Clearly, the last-minute change of leadership did not help to prevent the slide.In 2019 also, the party had fallen short of majority winning only 40 seats but managed to stich post poll alliance with Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) to form its government for second consecutive term. However, the alliance ended on a bitter note earlier this year and JJP leader and former deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has announced that he is ready for contest on all the 90 seats.""The new CM has only made announcements in the last 74 days which has taken the state backwards. The public will take accountability, they have seen it all. People have made up their minds,"" Chautala said.Clearly, Nayab Saini has an uphill task at hand as he tries to recover lost ground for the BJP. With 10 years in power, the BJP faces anti-incumbency. Also, the party would hope that there are no negative fallouts of Centre's handling of the farmers agitation.The Congress on the other hand is confident of a good show. In 2019, the party managed to win 30 seats, 10 less than the BJP. The party is already running an aggressive campaign 'Haryana Maange Hisab' against the BJP government and is confident that people will vote for change.Congress leader and former state chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said: ""People were waiting for the poll date to be announced. We will form government with an overwhelming majority and the BJP will be ousted from power.""However, one of the biggest challenges that Congress faces is of factionalism in the party's state unit with several strong contenders vying for prominence.The Congress has made it clear that it will not ally with any INDIA bloc party in the state, which means that Arvind Kejriwal's AAP will try to make this a three-cornered contest.Then there is Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) which will be contesting the Haryana polls in alliance with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). In the last elections the BSP had garnered over 4% of votes, though it could not win any assembly seat.In J&K, the BJP would hope to make some significant gains, especially in the Jammu region. Assembly elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir after nearly a decade in three phases from September 18, allowing people of the Union Territory to elect a government after the scrapping of Article 370 in 2019.Union home minister Amit Shah said polls in J&K will further strengthen the roots of democracy and open the doors to a new period of development for the Union Territory.""In the last 10 years, the Modi govt through a series of relentless initiatives, has created a new era of peace, development and strengthening democracy in J&K,"" Shah wrote on X.The BJP would hope that the recent spike in terror incidents would not hamper its electoral prospects in the state.Almost all major parties have welcomed the EC's announcement of poll schedule in the state.The apex court had set September 30 as the deadline for assembly elections in the UT.Mehbooba Mufti's PDP alleged that the LG administration was full of prejudice and bias and was working to favour the BJP. “PDP welcomes this move but we have a few questions. Why were elections not held on time? Why did it take so much time?” Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti said.The National Conference will be led by party chief Farooq Abdullah in the elections and not his son, Omar Abdullah, who has opted to refrain from participating until Jammu and Kashmir's statehood is restored. Farooq Abdullah called for a level playing field for all political parties in the region as he alleged that the BJP -- the ruling party at the Centre -- held ""disproportionate advantages"".The Congress on the other hand made a significant organisational reshuffle ahead of the assembly polls as it appointed Tariq Hameed Karra as president of its Jammu and Kashmir unit. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also appointed two working presidents for Jammu and Kashmir -- Tara Chand and Raman Bhalla.The Congress has announced to make statehood a poll issue. However, it will be important to see if the grand old party manages to stitch alliance with any of the two regional parties - PDP and NC - who are part of the INDIA bloc at the national level.The grand old party has accused the Modi government of trying to control the revived state administration of Jammu and Kashmir by giving more powers to the LG in July this year.",The Election Commission on Friday announced dates for assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. The stage is set for the first big electoral faceoff between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

Isro officials said the rocket is designed for low turnaround time, costs less, is flexible in accommodating multiple satellites, has feasibility for launch on demand and requires minimal launch infrastructure. SSLV had its first developmental flight on August 7, 2022. ""It was a near miss,"" said the Isro chairman. ""The orbit we achieved was slightly shorter. We made corrections, and the second flight went very well. And now, the third.""The Isro chief said a team will identify an industry consortium that will work with Isro for two years to understand the technology and realise two vehicles, which will be launched by NSIL. After that, the technology will be open for industry. ""We have cataloged the skills the industry must possess. RFI outlines criteria like manufacturing ability, facility capability, and financial strength, with weighted marks for each. Companies will be shortlisted based on these criteria, and contract will be awarded for a technology transfer fee.""The chairman said the second spaceport in Kulasekarapattinam, being built for SSLV launches, will be ready in two years.

NEW DELHI: The announcement of assembly elections in J&K came amid a recent surge in terror activity, particularly in Jammu region. But with MHA backing the deployment of a large number of security forces, EC, recognising the enthusiasm among J&K voters to be agents of change by choosing the ballot over bullets and boycotts, has decided to proceed with the exercise with some meticulous planning.The schedule has been carefully designed to keep the polling period short and ensure adequate availability of forces soon after announcement of poll dates.The election schedule also looks to cover the areas with heightened terrorist activity in the initial phases to ensure optimum force deployment and area domination, and schedule polling in constituencies across both J&K regions in each phase.TOI has learnt that credible inputs have been landing on intelligence agencies' desk about designs by Pakistan-based elements to disrupt the upcoming assembly polls in J&K with attacks on security forces and candidates. Sources said the Election Commission , with the cooperation of the home ministry, nevertheless chose to take a measured risk to hold polls with the underlying principle that such nefarious designs should not be allowed to succeed.The poll process starts a day after the conclusion of Amarnath Yatra on Aug 19, since that would free up a good chunk of forces for election deployment. Also, the final rolls with July 1, 2024, as reference date would be published on Aug 20.""We have not wasted a single day. Also, the poll panel has ensured that districts that have attacks over the past couple of months - like Doda, Ramban, Kulgam and Anantnag - go to polls in the first phase itself, with Rajouri and Poonch too scheduled in the second phase,"" an EC functionary told TOI.Interestingly, the polls are being held amid the apple/saffron season and will coincide with tourist festivals, which underlines the confidence of EC in going ahead with the exercise. CEC Rajiv Kumar on Friday said the EC will ensure that each candidate gets security and shall also honour J&K parties' request that security of all candidates and party office bearers be on par. About 16,000 or more security personnel may be deployed for this purpose, as per sources. For the first time, the EC has taken care to schedule polls together in constituencies across both Jammu and Kashmir valleys. Polling will be spread over three phases covering all of 14 days - as per an EC functionary, this is the shortest poll window in J&K, barring the 1987 exercise.""The EC is conducting the assembly polls buoyed by its confidence in the people of J&K who are not only keen on change but also want to be agents of that change by choosing ballot over bullet and boycott,"" the CEC said on Friday.Citing the record turnouts in J&K in the recent Lok Sabha polls, the CEC said, ""Time has come to erect the building on the solid foundation that was laid during the 2024 general election.""","The announcement of assembly elections in J&K came amid a recent surge in terror activity, particularly in Jammu region. With MHA backing the deployment of a large number of security forces, EC has decided to proceed with the exercise with some meticulous planning.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576871,imgsize-1278081,width-400,resizemode-4/112576871.jpg"

In the past decade, Modi government has performed many electoral experiments in J&K, but the people have time and again rejected BJP's undemocratic tactics trampling upon their constitutional rights...

"After 10 years, J&K to vote in 3 phases, Haryana on October 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-10-years-jk-to-vote-in-3-phases-haryana-on-october-1/articleshow/112576318.cms,"J&K, after Delhi and Pondy, will be 3rd UT to have elected assembly

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday announced assembly elections in Jammu & Kashmir and Haryana , ending a 10 year-wait for political parties since the last state elections and honouring Supreme Court 's September 30 deadline. This will be the first-ever assembly election in J&K since the nullification of Article 370 and its reorganisation as a Union Territory .Staggered over just three phases, the upcoming J&K poll is perhaps the shortest in several decades, with polling to be conducted over a 14-day period between September 18 and October 1.Haryana will see a single-day poll on October 1. Counting for both J&K and Haryana will be held on October 4, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, flanked by election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu, said at the press conference here. Assembly elections in Maharashtra, which were held along with Haryana in 2019, will be announced later due to security requirements for J&K, he added.Congress will look to preempt a BJP hat-trick in Haryana, and pull off a good show in J&K, where leading local parties National Conference and People's Democratic Party are its allies in INDIA but are likely to fight solo.BJP is banking on its course correction with the appointment of Nayab Saini as Haryana CM and its narrative of development post-370 to boost its performance and blunt the opposition's claims of a loss of face and numbers in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The shortened poll schedule is not the only first in regard to J&K. This is also the first polls after the implementation of ST quota in assembly seats post-abrogation of Special Status on August 5, 2019. J&K will become the third UT, after Delhi and Puducherry, to have an elected assembly. The strength of J&K assembly has grown to 90 from 83 since the last polls, with Jammu region getting six of the seven additional seats. Nine seats almost a tenth of the total strength have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes; six of these seats are in Jammu. Seven seats, all in Jammu, are reserved for Scheduled Castes.While upholding the Article 370 abrogation and reorganisation of J&K last year, Supreme Court had directed EC to hold polls in the UT by September 30. CEC Kumar said given the window available after the completion of Amarnath Yatra, polls were being held ""well within the time period"".By scheduling polls in J&K despite the recent uptick in terrorist activity, EC is taking a measured risk, guided by the consideration that the postoponment of polls because of the spike in terror could only embolden Pakistan which is suspected to have re-activated its jihadi proxies, this time largely in Jammu region. There will be enough forces on poll deployment and security given to all candidates, as assured by the Union home ministry in discussions with EC.""The EC will ensure that all layers of democracy are strengthened with high participation of people as well as candidates, more campaign rallies and meetings and wider use of IT apps like CVigil and Suvidha,"" CEC Kumar said. He added that said EC’s confidence lies in the people of J&K who are keen on change and also want to be agents of that change by choosing ballot over bullet and boycott.Citing the record turnouts in J&K in the recent Lok Sabha polls, the CEC said, “Time has come to erect the building on the solid foundation laid during the 2024 general election”. Polls represent an opportunity to key regional players of J&K, National Conference and PDP, which will seek to return to office after their near-marginalisation in the six years of central rule.Haryana is set for a triangular electoral contest among BJP which will look to beat incumbency; a resurgent Congress buoyed by its improved Lok Sabha tally; and AAP that is in office in neighbouring Punjab and Delhi","J&K assembly has grown to 90 from 83 since the last polls, with Jammu region getting six of the seven additional seats. This is also the first polls after the implementation of ST quota in assembly seats post-abrogation of Special Status on August 5, 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576326,imgsize-1288853,width-400,resizemode-4/112576326.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Government is unlikely to immediately step into the controversy created by the Hindenburg report as senior officials believe that the charges against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, are ""untrue and malicious"" and are in response to the regulator 's notice to the short seller.They alleged that Hindenburg may also be trying to make a quick buck from the Indian markets through its latest action and the regulator and govt are keeping a close tab on how the developments unfold.Describing it as a fresh attempt to ""create a smokescreen"", a govt source suggested that this may be part of a larger attempt to discredit the regulator at a time when the Indian stock market is seeing a good run on the back of healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and strong growth prospects with clean corporate and bank balance sheets. The source alleged such actions were part of a pattern to hit Indian markets but argued that the markets were now strong and deep enough to withstand Hindenburg-type attacks.""There have been a series of regulatory actions to improve the overall functioning of the markets and the regulator itself has not shied away from cautioning investors, wherever it sees pressure building up,"" another official said, while listing out a host of measures taken by Sebi.
