Election Commission seeks mule exception for polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-seeks-mule-exception-for-polls/articleshow/109577177.cms,"DARJEELING: The Election Commission on Wednesday urged the forest department to make ""one-time exception"" and allow mules in Singalila National Park to ease a five-hour trek by poll officials to reach Darjeeling's Srikhola village, which at 6,900 feet, houses Bengal's highest and remotest polling booths.After TOI reported on Tuesday that the ban on mules in Singalila National Park would make the trek more arduous for poll officials , carrying EVMs and poll-related materials to the three booths, the EC stepped in and urged the forest department to make an exception ahead of April 26 elections in Darjeeling.The forest department, which had imposed the ban on mules in Feb, did not comment.Darjeeling SDO Richard Lepcha, who helped ease the norm, said, ""Polling officials left for the three booths on Wednesday. The total distance to be traveled today is 106 km. An intermediate strong room, following EC norms, has been set up in Srikhola, where EVMs will be kept.""Lepcha added, ""On Thursday, the first group will head for Daragoan Junior High School, 17km from Srikhola, where the polling officer will get a ride on a four-wheeler following which there will be a trek for 5km-6km. The second group will head towards Rammam Forest Primary School 19km away, with a trek of half-a-kilometre. The third booth is at Samanden Forest Primary School, 26 km from Srikhola. The polling officer will have to trek 7 km. Porters will carry the luggage and EVMS.""A total of 209 people will cast their votes at Ramman Forest Primary School, located at the highest point and under Srikhola-Dargoan gram panchayat. The other booths, Daragoan School and Samanden Forest Primary School, have 1,034 and 213 voters.The forest department had imposed the ban on mules to prevent possible spread of infection to other animals. Passsang Sherpa, vice-president of Rimbhik Nature Guide Association, said tourists now depended solely on porters.","The forest department, which had imposed the ban on mules in Feb, did not comment.

"Won't go by 'Marxist interpretation' of wealth redistribution, says Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-go-by-marxist-interpretation-of-wealth-redistribution-says-sc/articleshow/109575160.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the political slugfest over redistribution of wealth escalating, Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will not adhere to Justice V R Krishna Iyer's 1977 Marxian interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution that a community's ""material resources"" would include private properties for reallocation to subserve the common good.Engaged in interpreting the ambit of Article 39(b) of Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution, a nine-judge bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih said there must be a distinction between community resources , held in trust by the present generation for future generations, and privately owned property.""We don't have to go as far as the Marxist socialist interpretation by Justice Krishna Iyer [of Article 39(b) in Ranganatha Reddy case of 1977]. But community resources will surely include resources which the present generation holds in trust based on inter-generational equity,"" the CJI said.He said there were two extreme views on this: ""The Marxist socialist view is everything belongs to the state and the community. The capitalist view puts importance on individual rights. And there is the Gandhian view of holding resources in trust for protecting inter-generational equity.""Speaking for the bench, the CJI indicated community property would include natural resources, exploitation of which is governed by the SC-defined sustainable development norms, as these are held in trust by the present community for future generations. However, he caveated it by saying forests, lakes and mines, even if held privately, would constitute community resources, benefits arising from which for the greater common good could not be stultified invoking individual rights.We cannot say Article 39(b) has no application to privately held properties like water, forests and mines. But it should not be taken to the level of taking someone's personal property for distribution,said CJI D Y Chandrachud.Senior advocate Uttara Babar argued that Article 39(b) talked only about ""distribution"" of community resources for greater common good and not how these are to be acquired, for which there are separate legislative and executive measures to be taken by the state.The bench agreed that Article 39(b) was not a vehicle for acquisition of community resources but only furthered a goal envisaged by the Constitution framers and said, ""This is an important point which the SC must deal with.""Advocate T Srinivasa Murthy said Article 39(b) could not be viewed from the acquisition of resources point of view. If govt wants to acquire a housing project to provide houses to the poor, it would have to first acquire the project after paying fair compensation to the existing owners, he said.""It is not really necessary for the state to specifically call for the aid of Article 39(b) and make a declaration to that effect to get the protection under Article 31C as the power to acquire for a public purpose upon payment of a reasonable compensation is inbuilt in the existing law,"" he said.""The theme of social and economic justice running through Articles 38 and 39 of DPSP is aimed at making all citizens active participants in the nation's economy while at the same time maintaining their dignity. These Articles are aspirational rather than seeking to make mere applicants and beneficiaries of citizens. It is equality of status, facilities and opportunities that is the focus, not equality of result,"" Murthy said. Arguments will continue on Thursday.","Supreme Court says it will not adhere to 1977 Marxian interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution.

30 India-based foreign journalists slam govt over reporter's claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/30-india-based-foreign-journalists-slam-govt-over-reporters-claim/articleshow/109573430.cms,"NEW DELHI: After another run-in with the foreign press, which saw senior ABC journalist Avani Dias alleging she was forced out of the country for not toeing the govt line, 30 India-based foreign journalists hit out at the govt for pushing out Dias at a time it was claiming to hold the largest democratic exercise in the world.Backing Dias' assertion that her journalism visa wasn't renewed because, as she was told by the govt, her reporting on the Sikh separatist movement had ""crossed a line"", the journalists in a letter called upon the Indian govt to facilitate the vital work of a free press in line with India's traditions."" Foreign journalists in India have grappled with increased restrictions on visas and journalism permits for those holding the status of Overseas Citizen of India. The circumstances of Ms Dias's departure are further cause for concern,"" they said in an open letter, in which they also registered a strong protest against how Dias was treated.Govt sources had responded to Dias on Tuesday by claiming her contention that she was not allowed to cover elections and was compelled to leave the country is not correct, misleading and mischievous. They said her visa had been renewed two days before her departure, while also accusing her of violating visa rules while undertaking her ""professional pursuits"".The journalists said in their letter, however, that though her visa was extended for two months just before her departure, she was told that she would not receive accreditation to cover the elections. ""Thus, though not technically expelling her, Indian authorities have effectively pushed out a foreign correspondent on the eve of an election that the govt describes as the largest democratic exercise in the world"".""Ms Dias, who has covered India since January 2022, left the country on Friday, the first day of the election. She departed after the govt told her that her reporting on the Sikh separatist movement (reporting that has since been blocked in India) had ""crossed a line"" and they would not renew her journalism visa,"" read the letter. Indian govt sources had also said that Dias had actually left for personal reasons and because she wanted to take up a new job offer. On Wednesday, The Australia Today said in a report Dias had returned ""driven by a new professional opportunity and personal milestone, rather than any alleged intimidation by the Indian govt"".",30 foreign journalists hit out at Indian govt for pushing out senior ABC journalist Avani Dias.

Supreme Court mulls whether 9-Judge bench can put Article 31 validity to test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-mulls-whether-9-judge-bench-can-put-article-31-validity-to-test/articleshow/109573248.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday witnessed an engrossing debate over the existing architecture of Article 31C , added to the Constitution in 1971 to shield legislations furthering objectives of Article 39(b) & 39(c) in Directive Principles of State Policy from court scrutiny for alleged violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14 (equality) and 19 (freedoms).A nine-judge bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih, which had on Tuesday categorically said that it would not go into the controversy relating to Article 31C, changed tack and asked, ""Is it not desirable that Article 31C's validity is put to rest by an authoritative pronouncement from the nine-judge bench?""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the seven-judge bench in its Feb 2002 order referring interpretation of Article 39(b) to a nine-judge bench had consciously omitted Article 31C from the ambit of consideration as the 13-judge bench in Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 had upheld the validity of its core principle. What the Bharati judgment invalidated was the part that barred courts from even scrutinising whether the legislations had any nexus with the objective of Article 39(b) to enjoy the shield.Smarting under the 'basic structure doctrine' ruling in Bharati case that circumscribed Parliament's power under Article 368 to amend the Constitution, Indira Gandhi govt in Dec 1976, through the infamous 42nd constitutional amendment, expanded Article 31C's ambit by which no legislation furthering any of the goals enshrined in the entire Directive Principles chapter could be challenged in court.SC in Minerva Mills case in 1980 struck down the amendments as violative of the 'basic structure doctrine' but created an ambiguity as to whether Article 31C was struck down in its entirety or only that part which was inserted in 1976. CJI Chandrachud referred to this and said, ""Minerva Mills created a conundrum regarding Article 31C.""Mehta stuck to his guns and said within months of Minerva Mills judgment, the SC in Waman Rao case ruled that ""Article 31C of the Constitution, as it stood prior to its amendment by Section 4 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, is valid to the extent to which its constitutionality was upheld in Kesavananda Bharati. Article 31C, as it stood prior to the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act does not damage any of the basic or essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure"".The bench asked whether Minerva Mills made any provision for revival of Article 31C after it struck down the entire amended version. Mehta cited the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act that had replaced the court-crafted collegium system for selection of constitutional court judges. He said when the SC struck down NJAC Act, it had ruled that the collegium system automatically revived. He argued that striking down the amended portion of Article 31C would revive the provision as it existed prior to the 1976 amendment.Attorney general R Venkataramani and senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi supported Mehta and said once the validity of the provision was upheld by a 13-judge bench, it would not lie within the domain of a nine-judge bench to go into it again. Senior advocate Zal T Andhyarujina will argue on Article 31C's nature of existence in the Constitution on Thursday.","A nine-judge bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih changed tack.

Operation Pawan: Veterans keep alive memory of a 'forgotten' mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-pawan-veterans-keep-alive-memory-of-a-forgotten-mission/articleshow/109573270.cms,"NEW DELHI: It had all the dignity and decorum that one associates with a military ceremony. Except, it was a ‘private’ function. A group of Indian army veterans and their families quietly gathered at the National War Memorial to lay wreaths in memory of the fallen soldiers of ‘ Operation Pawan ’, which India had launched in the late 1980s to save its neighbour Sri Lanka from disintegration.To those who participated in the operation, it seems like it happened just yesterday. But almost four decades have gone by. To recap, in the late 1980s, Sri Lanka was in the throes of severe insurgencies that threatened its territorial integrity . The Rajiv Gandhi govt dispatched the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to bring stability and peace in Sri Lanka.India lost 1,171 personnel, who were killed in action, while nearly 3,500 were wounded during Op Pawan that continued from 1987 to 1990. Nearly 100,000 troops from the tri-service were under the command of IPKF headquarters. Interestingly, the IPKF headquarters was India’s first joint operations military command and it set a precedent for future theatre commands, which the current Indian military leadership is now planning to set up.The IPKF was awarded one Param Vir Chakra, one Sarvottam Yudh Seva Medal, 98 Vir Chakra and over 250 other gallantry awards. Despite so many casualties and military honours, the apex military hierarchy termed Op Pawan a ‘minor’ operation. As a result, it does not get a formal commemoration day at the National War Memorial.A few years ago, a group of Op Pawan veterans and their families decided that the sacrifices of those who laid down their lives during the mission would not go unremembered. Every year, they gather to pay homage to the bravehearts who fell while fighting for the cause of their nation in a foreign land.Speaking to TOI, veteran Col R S Sidhu (retd), Sena Medal, said, “Though the number of martyrs of Op Pawan (1,171) is far more than those who laid down their lives in the Kargil war (around 530), even then the veterans of Op Pawan are being denied their rightful legacy of a formal day of commemoration at the National War Memorial.”He added, “It's quite an irony that though India military denies its Op Pawan veterans a formal day of commemoration, the Sri Lanka government has erected a magnificent War Memorial in Colombo to honour the supreme sacrifices made by the IPKF troops, where wreaths are laid twice a year.”TOI made several calls and sent WhatsApp queries to the defence PRO of the Integrated Defence Staff headquarters, which manages the affairs of the war memorial, but did not get any response till the time of filing this report.“It was our ‘karam’ as young officers to lead our troops into battle. Today, as veterans we follow our ‘dharam’ to ensure their supreme sacrifice is honoured,” Col Sidhu (retd) said.However, the veterans refuse to lose heart, and their perseverance seems to be paying off. This year, the presence of 50 uniformed personnel from the Rajputana Rifles regiment and 50 NCC cadets, standing shoulder to shoulder with the proud veterans, added grace and colour to the solemn ‘private’ ceremony.","India lost 1,171 personnel, who were killed in action, while nearly 3,500 were wounded during Op Pawan.

Supreme Court: Can't pass order on EVMs on suspicion of manipulation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-cant-pass-order-on-evms-on-suspicion-of-manipulation/articleshow/109573231.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed its unwillingness to pass any order regarding electronic voting machines (EVMs) only on the basis of suspected hacking and manipulation, while stating that it would not flinch from ensuring steps for improvement if it saw the need for any.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said the court was not the controlling authority of another constitutional body ( Election Commission ) which should take independent decisions pertaining to the poll process.When advocate Prashant Bhushan insisted there was still a possibility of a malicious programme being lodged in EVMs to alter the election results, the SC said. ""The report you are relying on says there is no incident of hacking yet. We are not the controlling authority of another constitutional authority. We cannot control the election. The judgment of the court did say VVPAT... but where is the direction to increase the paper count? Can we issue mandamus on the basis of suspicion?""The SC, on the previous hearing on April 18, had virtually ruled out the possibility of returning to ballot paper.The bench, on the previous hearing on April 18, had virtually ruled out the possibility of returning to ballot paper, and said there was a huge drawback with the system and use of EVMs had stood the test of time with increasing voting percentage reflecting voters' faith in it.Though the court had reserved its verdict earlier, it held another hearing on Wednesday to clear doubts regarding the technical functioning of EVMs and a deputy election commissioner, like on the last occasion, answered the court's queries.Asked whether microcontroller was installed in the controlling unit or the VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) unit, the commission told the bench that all three units - control unit, ballot unit and VVPAT unit - had their own microcontrollers which were one-time programmable.","Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said the court was not the controlling authority of another constitutional body. The bench, on the previous hearing on April 18, had virtually ruled out the possibility of returning to ballot paper.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109573237,imgsize-1490710,width-400,resizemode-4/109573237.jpg"

JEE Main 2024 Result: How are cut-offs determined?



Qualifying Cut-off

Admission Cut-off

Number of Applicants vs. Seats: There are a limited number of seats in NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs compared to the number of students appearing for JEE Main. So, with more applicants, the cut-off percentile/marks will be higher.

Difficulty Level of the Exam: If the JEE Main exam is considered difficult, the cut-off percentile might be slightly lower to account for the overall performance. On the other hand, an easier exam might result in a higher cut-off as more students score well.

Performance of the Test Takers: NTA analyzes the overall scores of all the candidates. The cut-off is set at a specific percentile (e.g., top 90% for General category) or based on achieving a certain minimum mark.

Wealth Redistribution Row: Congress into damage control mode amid backlash over Sam Pitroda's comments on wealth redistribution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-enters-damage-control-mode-amid-backlash-over-sam-pitrodas-comments-on-wealth-redistribution/articleshow/109552134.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Wednesday clarified its stance on Sam Pitroda 's recent comments over wealth redistribution , saying that sensationalising these remarks are attempts at diverting attention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""malicious"" poll campaign.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh emphasized that while Pitroda is a respected figure and has the right to express his personal opinions freely, his views do not necessarily reflect the official position of the party.""Sam Pitroda has been a mentor, friend, philosopher, and guide to many across the world, including me. He has made numerous, enduring contributions to India's developments. He is president of the Indian Overseas Congress. Mr Pitroda expresses his opinions freely on issues he feels strongly about. Surely, in a democracy an individual is at liberty to discuss, express, and debate his personal views,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in a post on x.""This does not mean that Mr Pitroda's views always reflect the position of the Indian National Congress. Many times they do not. Sensationalising his comments now and tearing them out of context are deliberate and desperate attempts at diverting attention away from Mr. Narenda Modi's malicious and mischievous election campaign; that is anchored ONLY in lies and more lies,"" he added.Pitroda had earlier expressed his support for the party's stance on wealth redistribution, drawing inspiration from the American system. He explained that in the United States, when a wealthy individual passes away, only a portion of their assets can be transferred to their children, while the government claims a significant share. Pitroda suggested that adopting a similar approach in India would be fair and beneficial for the public.However, Pitroda later clarified his stance, stating that he had only mentioned the US inheritance tax as an example during a normal conversation on TV. He emphasized that his comments had nothing to do with the policy of any party, including the Congress.""It is unfortunate that what I said as an individual on inheritance tax in the US is twisted by Godi media to divert attention from what lies PM is spreading about Congress manifesto . PM’s comments Mangal Sutra & gold snatching is simply unreal. I mentioned US inheritance tax in the US only as an example in my normal conversation on TV. Can I not mention facts? I said these are the kind of issues people will have to discuss and debate. This has nothing to do with policy of any party including congress,"" Pitroda said in a post on X.""Who said 55% will be taken away ? Who said some thing like this should be done in India ? Why is BJP and media in panic?"" he asked.Meanwhile, Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge said that the BJP is more concerned about concentrating wealth in a couple of industrialists' hands.""I think what Sam Pitroda is trying to say is that the distribution of wealth should be equitable. The current regime is more concerned about concentrating wealth in a couple of industrialists' hands. Whereas we are concerned about distributing wealth to the marginalised people of society, irrespective of their caste or community. The idea is to empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to ensure that we have an equitable society - both socially and economically,"" he said.The BJP, on the other hand, has criticized Pitroda's comments with party's IT Cell chief Amit Malviya, accusing the Congress of wanting to destroy India by advocating for a 50 per cent inheritance tax.In a post on X, Amit Malviya said, ""Congress has decided to destroy India. Now, Sam Pitroda advocates a 50 per cent inheritance tax for wealth redistribution. This means 50 per cent of whatever we build, with all our hard work and enterprise, will be taken away. 50 per cent, besides all the tax we pay, which too will go up, if Congress prevails.""Shehzad Poonawalla, BJP spokesperson, also criticized the Congress, claiming that the party wanted to grab the hard-earned resources of the people.""Congress, through Sam Pitroda the closest aide of Gandhi Vadra family, is essentially saying that 55% of what you earn will be taken away on your death. If you are a farmer- 55% of your land will be taken If you are a businessman - 55% of your business will be taken 55% of your savings you kept for your children Ironically Gandhis built a huge treasury for their own children & son in law but they want to grab your hard earned tax payed resources,"" Poonawalla said in a post on X.India does not have an inheritance or estate tax, as it was abolished in 1985.","Pitroda had earlier expressed his support for the party's stance on wealth redistribution.

If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,"" Pitroda had said.""The grand old party's ""dangerous intentions"" of snatching the assets and rights of people have come to the fore. The Congress will loot and equally distribute people's earnings and properties,"" PM claimed while addressing an election rally in Ambikapur, the headquarter of Surguja district, in Chhattisgarh.The PM said the Congress's mantra is of ""loot zindagi ke sath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi.""""Now they (Congress) have gone a step further and Congress is saying it will impose inheritance tax.

Speaking at the ' Samajik Nyay Sammelan ' in New Delhi, Gandhi emphasized that his focus is on 'Nyay' (justice) rather than caste.He said that his life's purpose is to secure justice for the 90 per cent of the population who have faced injustice.""As soon as our government is formed, the first thing that would be done is a caste census,"" Gandhi affirmed.He mentioned that the Congress manifesto addresses the 'X-ray' and the income inequality created by PM Modi.Modi has allocated Rs 16 lakh crore to specific business individuals, while the Congress plans to reimburse a modest sum to 90 per cent of the population, he said.""We have calculated, what we felt is justice and that help should be given, we put it down in the manifesto,"" he explained regarding the party's commitments outlined in the manifesto.""What does a deshbhakt want? A deshbhakt wants justice in the country. A deshbhakt wants India to move forward and become a super power. So if you want to become a super power and move ahead of China, one has to use strength of 90 per cent of the population.

If there are no castes how are you an OBC. Then you should have said I have no caste. He then says there are two castes rich and poor, if you say so, I say take out the list of poor and you will get Dalit, adivasis, backwards,"" Gandhi said.He made a strong declaration that guaranteeing justice for 90 per cent of the population was not a political move but rather his life's mission.There is a clear distinction between one's life's mission and politics, Gandhi emphasized as one may be willing to compromise in politics but not in their life's mission.He accused the BJP of attempting to divert the attention of Dalits, OBCs, and tribals by bringing up issues related to Pakistan, China, and Bollywood.""Problem they (BJP) have is that you can only divert attention for a limited period and that time has come when OBC is asking what is happening. Ram Mandir was constructed and we did not see one of our (Dalits and tribals) person, Parliament building was inaugurated but we did not see our person,"" Rahul Gandhi asserted.In reference to President Droupadi Murmu, he pointed out, 'It is the head of state's responsibility to inaugurate Parliament, but she was excluded from the ceremony.'Stressing that a caste census will provide clarity, he explained that it is not just a caste survey but an economic and institutional survey would also be attached to it.The nation will gain insights into the numbers of Dalits, adivasis, and poor general castes, as well as their involvement in different sectors, he further said.""Understand this that this is not politics for me and this is my life's mission and I guarantee... no force can stop caste census. The more it is stopped, the more it will return with bigger force because 90 per cent people, they are not probably saying it, but they have understood that in the institutional structure and the economy of the country, they do not have any place despite 90 per cent of the country is theirs,"" Gandhi",Rahul Gandhi said that his life's purpose is to secure justice for the 90 per cent of the population who have faced injustice.

The cost is to be paid within four months to the civic-run KEM Hospital in Mumbai.A division bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Arif S Doctor passed an order in PIL by one Nilesh Kamble who claimed to be a social worker with a business similar to the one mentioned in the tender issued by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).His grievance was to the eligibility conditions in the bid.The bench after hearing the petitioner’s counsel and Akshay Shinde counsel for MMRDA said it was 'unfortunate' that it was called upon to adjudicate a petition 'purportedly filed in public interest’ though it has “ apparently has been filed with oblique motives.”“On one hand this petitioner intends to espouse public cause and on the other hand, the petitioner himself states that he is engaged in similar business and accordingly, it is explicit that the proceedings of this writ petition have been instituted for pursuing personal and extraneous cause and not a public cause, the HC said in it order.The HC observed how “In our jurisprudence there has been a phenomenal rise of the PIL petitions being filed before the superior Courts.” It said, “The Rule of locus has been relaxed permitting any member of the society or an organization to file a petition in the interest of general public, for espousing the cause especially of those who, for some or the other reason, are in a disadvantageous situation, the reason may be poverty, illiteracy or their social status. However, permitting a contractor to file a PIL petition challenging the conditions of a tender, in our opinion, is nothing but a sheer abuse of process of Court and an effort to pollute the purity of the stream of public interest litigation. “"," Bombay High Court dismisses a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by a contractor challenging conditions of a tender issued by a government body.

Why Supreme Court's nine-judge bench needs to interpret Article 39(b),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-scs-nine-judge-bench-needs-to-interpret-article-39b/articleshow/109542453.cms,"NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday commenced the process for interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution to determine whether this directive principle of state policy provision allows govt to treat and redistribute privately owned properties under the garb of ""material resources of the community"" for greater common good.The interpretation by a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih stems from Justice V R Krishna Iyer's dissenting view in Ranganatha Reddy case of 1977 that community resources included private properties and the conflation of the two in later judgments, leading to the matter being referred on Feb 20, 2002, for interpretation by a nine-judge bench.Article 39(b) provides that the state shall direct its policy towards securing ""that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"".Senior advocates Devraj, Zal Andhyarujina and Sameer Parikh argued that community resources could never include privately owned properties. Arguments will continue on Wednesday.The advocates termed Justice Iyer's view a reflection of his Marxist socialist ideology which had no place in a democratic country governed by a Constitution giving primacy to fundamental rights of citizens.Though the question is old, it is reverberating in current politically-surcharged atmosphere after Rahul Gandhi's speech at a public meeting on Saturday where he said, ""First, we will conduct a caste census... to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population.""PM Modi quickly reacted to this by alleging that Congress will take away private wealth of citizens for redistribution and juxtaposed it with the 2006 speech of ex-PM Manmohan Singh.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the sole question before the court was interpretation of Article 39(b) and not Article 31C, the provision which provides safe harbour to laws enacted in pursuance of the directive principles, whose validity as it existed prior to the 25th constitutional amendment in 1971 has been upheld by a 13-judge bench in Kesavananda Bharti case.CJI Chandrachud agreed and explained why Article 39(b) needed to be interpreted by a nine-judge bench. ""The reason for the exercise before the nine-judge bench is that though majority in the Ranganatha Reddy case in 1977 clarified that material resources of the community do not include private property, a five-judge bench in Sanjeev Coke in 1983 relied on Justice Iyer ignoring that it was a minority view,"" he said.""In the meantime, SC in Mafatlal Industries case in 1997 opined that Article 39(b) needed interpretation by a nine-judge bench,"" the CJI said. In the Mafatlal case, SC had said it was difficult to accept the broad view that material resources of the community under Article 39(b) covered what is privately owned.The bench asked how excess agricultural land was distributed among poor peasants in the 1960s. Devraj said no one questioned the state's power to acquire land for public purposes after paying a fair compensation to the owner of the land. Land ceiling laws were passed by states to determine excess land accumulated by zamindars and such excess land was then redistributed, he said.""But if govt wants to take away my property and distribute it to the poor, then I would be left with no money as my fees would be taken away and paid to poor people,"" he said in a lighter vein.",A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court has commenced the process for interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution. The question is reverberating in current politically-surcharged atmosphere after Rahul Gandhi's speech at a public meeting on Saturday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109542470,imgsize-1662596,width-400,resizemode-4/109542470.jpg"

EC starts examining complaints against PM Modi's speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-starts-examining-complaints-against-pm-modis-speech/articleshow/109560003.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amidst a growing chorus of opposition condemnation, the Election Commission has initiated an examination of complaints lodged against a speech delivered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rajasthan. In the contentious address, PM Modi suggested that if the Congress were to assume power, it would purportedly redistribute wealth to Muslims .The Congress party and the Communist Party of India - Marxist ( CPI-M ) lodged separate appeals with the election watchdog, urging action against PM Modi's remarks made during a rally in Rajasthan.During his speech on Sunday, PM Modi inferred that a Congress-led government would prioritize the allocation of resources to the Muslim community, citing former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement regarding the minority community's entitlement to the nation's assets.Sources said the Election Commission has started examining complaints against the speech made by the prime minister.The Congress party, in its plea to the Election Commission, denounced PM Modi's comments as ""divisive,"" ""malicious,"" and targeting a specific religious group. They specifically referenced the remarks made by PM Modi in Banswara, Rajasthan.Similarly, Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of the CPI-M, took to social media to urge the Election Commission to address the complaint promptly. Yechury demanded that proceedings be initiated against PM Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), further advocating for the filing of an FIR.""Urge the ECI to take cognisance of this latest complaint and immediately launch proceedings against Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). An FIR needs to be lodged for inciting communal passions and hatred,"" Yechury said in his statement.Echoing the sentiments of the opposition, Congress leader and senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi underscored the gravity of the situation, characterizing it as a litmus test for the Election Commission.

These are our domestic politics which is going global, global politics which feels they must now intrude in India. How can these chaps decide who should be ruling them without consulting us?"" he said.Moreover, Jaishankar emphasised that the West perceives themselves as constituents of India's electorate, saying, ""I think it's time today that we disabuse them and the best way that we do that, is by confidence.""The external affairs minister stressed the importance of standing up to such attacks, criticisms, rankings, and reports, noting that they have the potential to question everything.""They will question your election system, your EVM, your election commission, even the weather,"" he said.""One complaint is... BJP is so unfair, BJP thinks it's going to win very big,"" he said, further adding that, in a way, today marks a crucial inflection point.Jaishankar said that the decisions the government will be making are not merely for the next five years but will also provide a significant vote of confidence for our nation, society, and future generations.""It is the guarantee, the guarantee is an expression of confidence. It is an expression of confidence based on what we have delivered for the last ten years,"" EAM added.He emphasised how India has been regarded globally over the past decade and stressed that the country is now gearing up for the next 25 years. This mindset, he argued, should inform our approach to the world.Moreover, recalling the G20 Summit, Jaishankar noted that during India's presidency, several countries expressed a desire to engage with India.""During our G20 presidency, a number of countries, but particularly this was an initiative called IMEC through Saudi Arabia, they wanted to connect India to Europe. Russia and Iran also want a connectivity passage to Europe. In the east, countries like Vietnam, and Cambodia, want a passage through Myanmar to India,"" he said.Lauding India's increasing prominence on the global stage, Jaishankar remarked that there is considerable interest in engaging with India, connecting to India, and collaborating with India. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jaishankar added, ""It is the combination of all of this and, as I said, the stature which the prime minister personally commands...I see that because I travel with him often.""Recalling India's assumption of the G20 presidency, Jaishankar said, ""When we took on the G20 chairmanship on December 1, 2022, many around the world expressed skepticism, questioning how we would manage it and foreseeing challenges. However, during the G20 summit, within the first day, we were able to forge a consensus.""He further emphasised that when events unfold, people often only witness the final outcome without recognizing the extensive work that takes place behind the scenes.""It's worth thinking why? Because when something happens, we think it's natural. It's not natural.

NEW DELHI: Stating that PM Narendra Modi is ""shaken, panicked and worried"" by Congress 's ""revolutionary"" manifesto, Rahul Gandhi Wednesday said the first decision of the future party govt will be caste census , which is a must to establish the meagre participation of 90% population of SC/ST/OBCs in the country's public and private structure. He said an X-ray of society - a national headcount to determine the socio-economic status of marginalised sections - is ""now my life's mission"".The Gandhi scion accused Modi of duplicity, saying the PM told the country in 2014 that he was an OBC but when the issue of ""caste census"" came up, the PM started claiming there were no castes in India, except ""rich"" and ""poor"".Warning that ""the entire BJP movement's mission is to erase the history"" of 90% population, he said the SC/ST/OBCs are being invisibilised from the country's past including the freedom struggle, and their real history has to be planted afresh.""I am not interested in caste, but am interested in 'nyay'. In India, 90% are facing terrible injustice and I didn't even say that we will take any action. I just said let's find out how much injustice is happening. What is objectionable about it?"" Rahul asked, adding, ""but look at the media and Modi. As I used the word X-ray, everyone started saying this is an attempt to divide the country. How will an X-ray divide? All patriots should like this.""The speech at ""samajik nyay sammelan"" organised by Samruddha Bharat Foundation upped the party's stakes in its recently crafted muscular social justice policy. Rahul posited ""caste census"" at the heart of the Congress agenda and, in the same breath, suggested that the party's tilt towards SC/ST/OBCs is behind the fresh BJP hostility towards Congress. While he did not touch upon the PM's claims linking Congress to ""redistribution of wealth"", his ""I have not even suggested any action but ..."" remark appeared a bid to pit social justice against PM's communal pitch in the ongoing Lok Sabha battle.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge echoed Rahul by alleging that ""BJP poses the biggest danger to SC/ST/OBC/women/minorities"" with its ""threat to end reservation"".Continuing the arguments he has proffered in recent times, Rahul said the mass media has negligible participation of SC/ST/OBCs, which results in anything good for the latter being dubbed as ""non serious or divisive"". He said the media used to call him ""non serious"" which rendered the causes he espoused- Land Acquisition Act, Niyamgiri protests, Bhatta Parsaul, NREGA - ""non serious"", while ""Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Virat Kohli became serious"". He said barely 100 judges out of 650 in the high courts are from 90% population, and most do not manage to reach the apex judiciary, while 200 biggest corporations are neither owned by SC/ST/OBC nor have them in the top management.","Gandhi scion says an X-ray of society - a national headcount to determine socio- economic status of marginalised sections - is ""now my life's mission"" Gandhi scion accused Modi of duplicity, saying the PM told the country in 2014 that he was an OBC but when the issue of ""caste census"" came up, the PM started claiming there were no castes in India, except ""rich"" and ""poor""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109573192,imgsize-78240,width-400,resizemode-4/109573192.jpg"

Did India have inheritance tax?

Indian Overseas Congress chairman Sam Pitroda’s comments on inheritance tax triggered a political slugfest on Wednesday with PM Modi attacking Congress for planning to impose higher taxes and not wanting people to pass on their hard-earned income to their heirs. Congress distanced itself from Pitroda’s remarks, and party spokesman Jairam Ramesh said former PM Rajiv Gandhi had, in fact, abolished estate duty in 1985.Here’s what the hullabaloo’s all about:He backed the idea of an inheritance tax and cited the example of the US. ""Nothing wrong in accumulating wealth but to what point? Let me tell you, in America there's an inheritance tax. So, if let's say one has $100 million worth of wealth, and when he dies he can transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by govt. Now that's an interesting law. It says you, in your generation made wealth, and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public - not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair. In India you don't have that. If somebody is worth $10 billion and dies his children get $10 billion. The public gets nothing. So these are the kinds of issues that people will have to debate and discuss.""Pitroda's comments on inheritance tax come against the backdrop of the Congress manifesto talking about addressing ""growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies"" and Rahul Gandhi's speeches pushing for economic and institutional surveys, along with caste census. BJP has cited Rahul's speeches to claim that the surveys would be a prelude to ""redistribution"" of wealth.This is a tax which is levied on property inherited when a person dies. According to Tax Foundation, a think tank on taxation , estate and inheritance taxes are broadly similar because both are generally triggered by death. Estate taxes are levied on the net value of property owned by a deceased person on the date of death. In contrast, inheritance taxes are levied on the recipients of the property, according to the foundation's definition.Inheritance tax has in some cases been justified to ensure ""equality of opportunity"". An OECD paper says that by breaking down the concentration of wealth and correcting for factors that are beyond the recipients' control, inheritance and gift taxation can contribute to levelling the playing field across individuals, and thereby increase equality of opportunity and improve social mobility. It cites Thomas Piketty, Saez and Zucman, who have argued that from a meritocratic perspective, inherited wealth should be taxed at higher rates than earned income and self-made wealth. There is an argument against the tax and critics in the US say scrapping it would help raise investments, create jobs and help in expansion of the economy.Several advanced countries, including the US, UK, Japan, France, and Finland, have inheritance tax ranging from 7% to 55%. Since 2000, 11 countries and two tax jurisdictions have scrapped estate or inheritance tax, according to Tax Foundation data. US prez Joe Biden has backed increasing the inheritance tax rate to 61%.India did have an inheritance tax, and levied a peak rate of 85% estate duty, which was abolished in 1985. Death of a property owner triggered the liability on estate duty. According to tax consulting firm Taxmann, 'property' was defined in the broadest possible terms and included all movable and immovable assets, interest in expectancy, interest in co-parcenary property (joint heirship), debt or enforceable right, etc. ""The liability on estate duty was cast on the recipient of the estate who was to file a return of estate received based on which the competent authority would complete an assessment. In case an asset was inherited jointly, a joint return was required to be filed,"" according to Taxmann.Several measures to bring social equity have been imposed in the country, including gift tax, wealth tax and estate duty. Wealth tax was scrapped in 2015, while gift tax was withdrawn in 1998 but reintroduced in 2004, levying income tax on gifts to relatives. There was speculation in 2020 that the Union Budget may bring back estate duty. In 2014, the then junior finance minister Jayant Sinha had backed the idea of bringing inheritance tax but it did not move beyond the idea stage.","PM Modi attacks Congress for not wanting people to pass on their hard-earned income to their heirs.

Congress will ""loot your earnings, zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi"", he said.""Congress eyes not only your reservation, but also your earnings, your houses, shops and farms.The Congress 'shehzada' says they will conduct an X-ray of the property of every house and every family in the country.

""I need not tell you whom they will distribute it to,"" he said as the audience burst into loud applause to indicate that they had got the hint.Modi alleged that Congress had ""dangerous intentions"". ""Congress wants to confiscate properties and assets from people's children and also plans to introduce reservations based on religion,"" he said, asserting that faith-based reservations were aligned with Muslim League's ideology while being violative of the Constitution.""Today, I would like to highlight Congress's Muslim League-like mentality before the people of Surguja. When the Constitution was being drafted under the leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar, it was decided that reservation would not be based on religion. If there is to be reservation, it will be for my tribal and Dalit brothers and sisters... The day their manifesto was released, I said it has the imprint of Muslim League, and I say so today,"" Modi said.""Years ago, Congress tried to implement reservation on the basis of religion in Andhra Pradesh. It planned to implement it across the country. They talked about implementing 15% reservation on the basis of religion and said it will be done after curtailing SC, ST and OBC quota,"" he added.Accusing Congress of being ""vote-hungry"", Modi said, ""Congress claims it will bring about revolutionary changes once in office, but the public is not going to give them that chance. The dangerous intentions of Congress are becoming increasingly evident. They have handed over the entire Congress party, as if it was their ancestral property, to their children. But they don't want ordinary Indians to pass on their property to their children.""Modi stressed that the culture of the country was not consumerist. ""Rather, it values accumulation, enhancement and preservation. This ethos has enabled the preservation of nature and the environment. People in India traditionally preserve their assets, intending to pass them down through generations,"" he said.""When I mentioned that urban Naxalites have infiltrated Congress, there was an uproar, and they issued statements against me... But they should not waste time nitpicking my statements. Congress only wants to loot your property...

"From 'hua toh hua' to 'US inheritance tax': Sam Pitroda 'embarrasses' Congress, again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-hua-toh-hua-to-us-inheritance-tax-sam-pitroda-embarrasses-congress-again/articleshow/109570632.cms,"On Ram Mandir

On 1984 anti-Sikh riots

On Pulwama attack

Nehru vs Ambedkar on Constitution

On Nyay scheme

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda has done it again. The chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress has yet again made a remark that has triggered a political storm and put the grand old party on the defensive. Pitroda's remarks on the concept of inheritance tax in the US have been lapped up by the BJP to reinforce its wealth distribution attack on the Congress.It comes at a time when the Congress has been trying hard to counter Prime Minister Modi's relentless attack over its manifesto pitch on socio-economic and caste survey and redistribution of resources.PM Modi on Wednesday seized on Pitroda's remarks to step up a blistering attack on the issue of ""wealth redistribution"", saying ""zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi"" is the opposition party's mantra to ""loot"" people.In his poll rallies, PM Modi framed Pitroda's comments in his wider onslaught against the Congress, asserting that they have exposed its hidden agenda and that the party has become so removed from the country's social and family values that it wants to legally rob people of their assets and lifelong savings they want to bequeath to their children.The Congress was quick to distance itself from Pitroda's remarks. Jairam Ramesh who is also the Congress general secretary (Communications) said, ""Sam Pitroda expresses his views on issues that he considers important, very freely. On this particular issue also he is not reflecting the official position of the Congress. But I think what is happening is, that his comments are torn out of context and they are being sensationalized in order to divert attention from the PM's deliberate, mischievous and malicious, poison-ridden campaign.""Unfortunately for the Congress, this is not the first time that Sam Pitroda has put the grand old party on the backfoot with his ""off the cuff"" remarks, especially in the election season. Here's a look at some of the old Pitroda remarks that stoked controversy.In June 2023, when the country was waiting for the grand Ram Mandir opening, Pitroda gave BJP ammunition to attack the Congress as he said that temples were not going to solve India’s problems of unemployment, inflation, education, and health. ""No one talks about these things. But everyone talks about Ram, Hanuman, and Mandir. I have said that temples are not going to create jobs,"" he said.In May 2019, Pitroda ""hua to hua"" (so what) when he was asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. ’84 mein hua to hua. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. Aapne wo bhi nahi kiya. Aapne kuch nahi kiya isliye aap yahan wahan gup lagate hain',"" Pitroda had then said.In February 2019, Pitroda kicked up a storm as he raised questions on Balakot air strikes by the Indian Air Force which were carried out in retaliation to the Pulwama attacks. ""I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. The attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.Citing an article by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide of BJP veteran LK Advani, Pitorda in a social media post had claimed that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, contributed more than BR Ambedkar in the framing of the Constitution. Pitroda later deleted the post.Pitroda put the Congress party in a tough spot in April 2019 when he said that the middle class should not be selfish. They should be prepared to shell out more taxes to fund the party’s proposed NYAY, a scheme promising a guaranteed minimum income for every poor household, he had said.","Pitroda's remarks on the concept of inheritance tax in the US have been lapped up by the BJP to reinforce its wealth distribution attack on the Congress.

No-one else will have any say in candidates selection.""But not realising this, Vemireddy couple and three other legislators including former finance minister Anam Ramanarayana Reddy, Kotamreddy Sridhar Reddy and Mekapati Chandrasekhar Reddy deserted the party for obvious political gains. But the people of the state will teach these back-stabbers a befitting lesson in the upcoming elections"", Vijayasai Reddy underlined.Reacting sharply to Vijayasai Reddy's remarks, Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy said the autocratic leadership at the YSRCP caused him anguish and extreme heartburn. ""Despite pledging outright support to the party at all times without seeking anything from the party, the YSRCP leadership didn't even seek my opinion when the crucial Nellore city assembly nominee was chosen. I exited the YSRCP only to protect my self-respect and not for any other reason as is being alleged by my political opponent.""Today, people of Andhra Pradesh are in the grip of the fear and insecurity phobia unleashed by the YSRCP govt. They are eager to vote out the ruling disposition and pledge support to the NDA alliance. It is in the interest of the state and Nellore parliament that the TDP should form the next govt to bring back development to the state"", Vemireddy exuded confidence.","Both Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy (TDP) and Venumbaka Vijayasai Reddy are first timers on the poll scene, though they played a key role in the state politics for more than two decades.
