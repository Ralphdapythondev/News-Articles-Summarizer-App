"Monsoon 2024: Regional variation puts Rajasthan in the spotlight, arid west gets 72% more than normal rainfall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-2024-regional-variation-puts-rajasthan-in-the-spotlight-arid-west-gets-72-more-than-normal-rainfall/articleshow/113684734.cms,"NEW DELHI: The four-month monsoon season is most likely to end recording ‘above normal’ rainfall over the country as a whole on Sept 30. But, its spatial distribution this year presented a unique variation with Rajasthan , generally a rain-starved state, so far, receiving 56% more than its 'normal' rainfall while four northeastern states, Bihar, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and J&K reporting a huge deficit.Interestingly, west Rajasthan, a large part of which is arid, has, so far, received 72% more than normal rainfall, whereas east Rajasthan got 46% above normal cumulative rainfall (June 1-Sept 25). Overall, the country received 5.4% more than normal rainfall till Wednesday with five more days to go for the culmination of the rainy season.Though Rajasthan has consistently been showing an increasing trend in quantitative rainfall for the past few years, such a huge variation this year, where the state reported 672.1 mm of cumulative rainfall compared to its normal of 430.6 mm, is something that has caught meteorologists' attention.Experts don’t rule out gradual change in the spatial distribution and quantitative variation in rainfall over the country as a whole due to climate change in the long run but good rain in Rajasthan this year is attributed to natural variability of the complex weather system .""There has been increasing rainfall trends over Rajasthan. It could be related to more westward movement of low pressure systems to the state. It could be part of natural variability and may not be attributed to climate change. Interestingly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models suggest more rains over Rajasthan and deserts in the future,"" Madhavan Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES), told TOI.Noting that good rains in Rajasthan this year is ""not an aberration at all"", K J Ramesh, former IMD director general, said, ""Rajasthan has clearly an established increasing trend of rainfall since 2000. Excessive moisture loading from Arabian Sea on to Gujarat and Rajasthan in recent decades could be the reason.""In 2020, an MoES report on 'Observed Rainfall Variability and Changes' that analysed the rainfall pattern over all states/UTs, based on 30 years of data (1989-2018), flagged that seven states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland - have shown ""significant decreasing trends"" in annual rainfall.","The four-month monsoon season is most likely to end recording ‘above normal’ rainfall over the country as a whole on Sept 30.

NEW DELHI: The Andhra Pradesh BJP has called upon YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to publicly ""declare his faith"" ahead of his planned pilgrimage to the Tirumala temple amid allegations over adulterated "" prasadam "" sold during the YSRCP leader's tenure.Jagan Reddy is scheduled to visit the Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple on September 28 at Tirumala Hills as part of a series of temple ceremonies organized by his party across the state.The YRCP's rituals are aimed at ""atoning for the sin"" allegedly committed by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu , who accused the YSRCP of using substandard ingredients, including animal fat, in the making of Tirupati laddus .""We are given to understand that Jagan Mohan Reddy intends to visit Tirumala on the 28th of this month. The practice of declaring one's faith has been in vogue for decades in Tirumala. As per G.O. MS NO- 311 of AP Revenue Endowments -- 1, Rule no 16, Non Hindus must give a declaration at Vaikuntam que complex before darshan in the faith form. This is also as per TTD general regulations Rule 136,"" said Andhra Pradesh BJP chiefDaggubati Purandeswari .Purandeswari further said that the Andhra Pradesh ex-chief minister ""should give the declaration of his faith at the Garuda Statue itself at Alipiri"".As per rule number 136 and 137 of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD)'s general rules, only Hindus should be allowed to worship at the Tirumala temple and every non-Hindu should voluntarily inform TTD about his religion and seek permission to gain entry into the Tirumala temple after signing the declaration for non-Hindus.Though this guideline has been in vogue for several decades now, an amendment was brought to the rule in the AP Endowments Act in 2014, according to which TTD will have to identify the devotees' religion going by their facial features.CM Naidu sparked controversy by alleging that animal fat was mixed in the ghee used to prepare the famous Tirumala laddu during the term of the previous YSRCP government led by Jagan Mohan Reddy.YSRCP denied the allegations and said Naidu was making wild statements for political reasons . Naidu said that he was astonished to find that poor-quality material was used to prepare Lord Venkateswara's ""prasadam"".A day after Naidu's claim, his government made public a laboratory analysis report of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its laddu.It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil. The report, however, is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu's allegation and the NDDB's report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.As the controversy spiralled into a massive outrage, the Centre weighed in and sought a full report on the issue and Union health minister JP Nadda assured that the government would further the matter and take suitable actions.During a press conference, Nadda said that he spoke to Naidu after the controversy erupted and announced speaking to state regulators for a thorough investigation. The temple trust prepares about three lakh laddus daily and the ""prasadam"" is held in high regard by devotees.After reports of beef fat and fish oil being found in the cow ghee samples used to make the Tirupati 'laddu prasadam,' the temple trust said that the sanctity of the ""prasadam"" was restored . The trust said that they have also stalled the use of cow-based products temporarily for making Srivari Prasadams.During YSRCP's tenure in government, TTD had given the ghee supply contract to a private contractor, replacing the ""Nandini"" brand of ghee, a product of Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).Following the change in supplier, there were several complaints over the quality of the laddu. The NDA government on August 29 signed a contract once again with KMF for ghee. TTD utilises about 10,000 kg of ghee every day for the laddu ""prasadam"".","Jagan Mohan Reddy is scheduled to visit the Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple on September 28 at Tirumala Hills.

MUMBAI: A political storm has erupted over Maharashtra cabinet’s decision to directly allot 5 hectares of land in Nagpur’s Koradi area for educational purposes to a trust headed by state BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule , overriding objections raised by finance and revenue departments.The land allotted to Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan is worth Rs 4.8 crore, according to state govt’s Ready Reckoner (RR) rate.The finance department had pointed out the trust did not qualify for direct allotment because it nei ther has “long experience” in the field of higher and technical education nor is it a renowned institution.Sources said the proposal for the direct allotmentwas not on the agenda and was presented at the last minute in Monday’s cabinet meeting. It was passed without any discussion or a prior note being circulated to explain the proposal.“Mahayuti govt has distributed Rs 5 lakh crore of public land. Prime land is being given at 25% of the RR rate,” alleged Congress functionary Vijay Wadettiwar.“When MVA govt comes to power in two months, we will probe such cases,” said NCP (Sharad Pawar group) functionary Anil Deshmukh. “From Vinoba Bhave’s slogan that all land belongs to Govinda, BJP’s slogan is all land belongs to Devabhau [Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis] and he will distribute it to whoever he wants,” alleged Shiv Sena (UBT) ‘s Sanjay Raut.Bawankule, however, was combative. “This is not my trust. I am just the president and the person holding the post changes every two years. There should be no politics around a devasthan (religious institution),” he said. Revenue minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil from BJP said, “The department has supported the allotment.”On Nov 29, 2023, Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan had applied for direct allotment of the land to set up a junior college, science-arts-commerce college, nursing college, and skill development centres.","The land allotted to Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan is worth Rs 4.8 crore, according to state govt’s Ready Reckoner (RR) rate.

Kerala probes senior cop’s meet with RSS netas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-probes-senior-cops-meet-with-rss-netas/articleshow/113683265.cms,"ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar (File photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/ KOZHIKODE: Kerala government has initiated an inquiry into alleged meetings ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar had with two high-ranking RSS functionaries last year. The move comes after political pressure, with opposition and leaders of LDF ally CPI — including its national secretary D Raja — seeking a probe into these allegations.State police chief Shaik Darvesh Saheb, who has been asked to conduct the probe, is already inquiring into various serious allegations — including links to gold smuggling rackets, role in mur ders, and corruption — raised against Ajith Kumar by CPM-backed independent MLA PV Anvar.It was opposition leader VD Satheesan who first alleged that Ajith Kumar had met RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale in Thris sur in May last year at Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s behest, following which ADGP himself admitted it. It was reported later that ADGP had also met another top RSS functionary, Ram Madhav, at a hotel in Kovalam. The meetings reportedly happened during events organised by RSS.The probe is aimed at gathering statements from those who attended these meetings, for which notices have been issued to some RSS functionaries. CPM, however, had sought to downplay the meetings, terming them as personal. After some LDF allies raised these issues at a recent front meeting, Vijayan had assured them that all charges raised against the police officer would be probed.Meanwhile, Congress termed the probe a “farce.” AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said CPM and Kerala govt have something to hide regarding ADGP-RSS functionaries meeting and that there is a lack of transparency in govt’s actions. He criticised the CPM top brass for remaining silent, calling it unfortunate.Satheesan alleged as the CM’s emissary, Ajith Kumar had proposed to RSS functionary that they could help BJP win the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat and in return RSS should ensure that they should not be trouble in any manner.","Kerala government has initiated an inquiry into alleged meetings ADGP (law & order) MR Ajith Kumar had with two high-ranking RSS functionaries last year.

Nandini: A popular household name in South India

Leadership at KMF

The origins of

Karnataka Milk Federation

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Describing India-China ties as ""significantly disturbed"", foreign minister S Jaishankar said the relationship is key to Asia's future and will influence not just the continent but the entire world.Speaking at a think tank in New York on Tuesday, he said the parallel rise of India and China presents a ""very unique problem"" in current global politics. ""In a way, you can say that if the world is to be multi-polar, Asia has to be multi-polar.Therefore, this relationship will influence... perhaps the future of the world as well,"" Jaishankar said.Jaishankar, who will address the UNGA on Saturday, recently said that the two neighbours have resolved 75% of "" disengagement problems "" in eastern Ladakh. Referring to those remark, he said Tuesday, ""When I said 75% of it has been sorted out - I was asked in a way to quantify - it's only of the disengagement. So, that's one part of the problem. The main issue right now is the patrolling. You know, how do we, both of us, patrol up to the Line of Actual Control.""India and China have intensified diplomatic and military talks in the past few months to fully resolve the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, ahead of a possible meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in October. Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong said last week that ties are at a crucial stage of improvement.Jaishankar said the patrolling arrangements after 2020 have been disturbed. ""So, we've been able to sort out much of the disengagement, the friction points, but some of the patrolling issues need to be resolved.""The minister said that after disengagement, ""there is the larger issue as both of us have brought a very large number of troops up to the border"".""So, there is what we call the de-escalation issue, and then there is the larger, the next step is really, how do you deal with the rest of the relationship?""Jaishankar added there were a series of agreements between the two countries that went into greater detail on how to make sure the border remained peaceful and stable.""Now the problem was in 2020, despite these very explicit agreements, we saw that the Chinese - we were all in the middle of Covid at that time - moved a large number of forces in violation of these agreements to the Line of Actual Control. And we responded in kind,"" he said.""Once troops were deployed very close up, which is 'very dangerous', it was likely a mishap could happen, and it did happen,"" Jaishankar added.Referring to the 2020 Galwan clash , the minister said, ""So there was a clash, and a number of troops died on either side, and that has since, in a sense, overshadowed the relationship. So, until we can restore peace and tranquillity on the border and ensure the agreements signed up to are adhered to, it's obviously difficult to carry on with the rest of the relationship.""","S Jaishankar said the parallel rise of India and China presents a ""very unique problem"" in current global politics.

NEW DELHI: More than 50 drugs being sold in the market that are prescribed for common conditions such as high blood pressure, acid reflux and erectile dysfunction have been found to be not-of-standard quality by Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) in its latest survey. CDSCO, the apex body responsible for approval of new drugs and clinical trials , has issued an alert saying such drugs are being freely sold in the market.According to its latest data, last month, certain batches of more than 50 drugs manufactured by various companies were found to be not-of-standard quality. This included drugs sold by leading companies.For example, a specific batch of Pulmosil (Sildenafil injection) manufactured by Sun Pharmaceuticals was found to be not-of-standard quality. The company, however, claimed in its response to CDSCO that the tainted batch of the product was not been manufactured by it and that it was a spurious drug. A specific batch of Pantocid, commonly used for acid reflux and indigestion, manufactured by the same company was also found to be spurious.One particular batch of Telma H (Telmisartan 40mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg tablets IP), a combination of two medicines used to control blood pressure, manufactured by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals was found to be non-standard. Glenmark, too, claimed the particular batch was not made by it.One batch of Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate tablets IP (Clavam 625) manufactured by Alkem Health Science, another leading pharmaceutical company, also failed to meet the standards.""The failure of any specific batch of a drug to meet the standards does not mean all drugs being sold by that name are substandard. Also, quality issues are monitored periodically and often addressed promptly to prevent any public health issues,"" a senior official from CDSCO said.Drug regulatory bodies carry out random sampling and tests on a regular basis to spot and alert the authorities about potential violation of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Officials said there hasn't been any significant increase in the number of samples found to be lacking in the desired standards. However, they added that the govt continues to keep up the pressure, so the manufacturing process improves and there is no violation at all.","More than 50 drugs being sold in the market that are prescribed for common conditions such as high blood pressure, acid reflux and erectile dysfunction have been found to be not-of-standard quality.

NEW DELHI: The multi-material semiconductor fabrication unit to be set up in India as a result of the agreement between New Delhi and Washington during PM Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the US will roll out chips that will cater to the national security needs of the two countries.The new plant, likely to come up in Uttar Pradesh’s Jewar, near the upcoming international airport, will supply advanced chips to the US armed forces, allied militaries and Indian defence forces.The cutting-edge semiconductor plant will produce chips for advanced warfare technologies, including night vision devices, missile-seekers, space sensors, drones, fighter jets, electric vehicles, military communications, radars and jammers.The plant will include a testing center, a centre of excellence, a design hub and two fabrication units. This initiative is part of growing India-US cooperation under the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor (ICET) and the CHIPS Act, aimed at strengthening semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.Addressing the diaspora in New York after the key US pact, Modi indirectly referred to the semiconductor unit agreement as he said: “The day is not far when you will see made-in-India chips in America. This small thing will take India to another level. And this is Modi's guarantee.”Besides high-tech defence equipment, semiconductors made here can be used in railways, electric vehicles and smart toll systems.The US security establishment has relied its trust on an Indian startup, led by two young entrepreneurs, Vinayak Dalmia and Vrinda Kapoor, with technology to produce chips that will feed America's security infrastructure as well as aid its allies.The startup, 3rdiTech, is collaborating with General Atomics, a US defence major, on a series of significant projects to boost defence technology capacity in India. The manufacturers aim to produce 50,000 units every year to start with phase 1.The collaboration between US Military, Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech will make India one of the few countries in the Indo-Pacific besides China, which will have the capability to make complex compound semiconductors.The manufacturing unit will primarily make infrared, gallium nitride, silicon carbide semiconductors. While traditional semiconductors use one material that is silicon, compound semiconductors use two or more materials. Around 80% of the world’s semiconductors use silicon and only 20% are compound semiconductors.However, compound semiconductors can handle more power than silicon semiconductors and are 100 times faster.At present, India imports one billion dollars worth of compound semiconductors for defence needs on an annual basis. Once this plant comes up, India’s reliance on imported chips will come down drastically.Though the company is likely to consider selling semiconductors to electric vehicle companies, 5G and 6G applications, and other technology sectors, the first priority for the initial period will be to supply semiconductors to meet the needs of the Indian and American defence forces.The joint fact sheet also has another declaration in the semiconductor sector as Modi and US President Joe Biden praised ""combined efforts to facilitate resilient, secure and sustainable semiconductor supply chains, including through GlobalFoundries’ (GF) creation of the GF Kolkata Power Centre in Kolkata"".This centre is expected to ""enhance mutually beneficial linkages to research and development in chip manufacturing and enable game-changing advances for zero and low emission as well as connected vehicles, internet of things devices, AI and data centres"".","The multi-material semiconductor fabrication unit to be set up in India as a result of the agreement between New Delhi and Washington.

NEW DELHI: Perturbed over high number of complaints against poor maintenance of national highways (NHs) during monsoon, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has ordered his ministry to conduct an “end-to-end investigation” of both Sohna-Vadodara stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Jamnagar expressways. The minister has instructed that the investigation must be carried out by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) at the earliest.In another direction, Gadkari has instructed the ministry to probe the maintenance issues of Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), which works as a bypass for Delhi. The minister has referred to his recent experience on the 135-km expressway when he had gone to participate in a plantation drive.The minister has sought fixing accountability and taking strictest action against those responsible. Sources said the minister is aggressively pursuing investigation into such cases after the recent incidents.A few days before the plantation event, there were reports of a portion of Delhi-Mumbai expressway caving in Rajasthan and a huge pothole on the recently built Amritsar-Jamnagar economic corridor. Videos of these stretches had gone viral on social media, prompting the minister to order immediate rectification and to initiate action against the contractor and officials concerned.In the case of the Amritsar-Jamnagar project, the NHAI imposed Rs 50 lakh fine on the contractor for not attending to the defects timely and two engineers of the Authority Engineer (AE) were terminated for poor supervision and lapses. A site engineer was sacked and show cause notices were issued to two NHAI officials. Even in the case of Sohna-Mumbai expressway, NHAI took similar action against the contractor, engineers and officials concerned.Warning that none will be spared for the negligence and poor maintenance of highways, Gadkari at the plantation event had said that both domestic and foreign contractors would be blacklisted. “Now we want to make a record of retiring non-performing officers and blacklisting contractors who fail to do good work and maintain stretches with them after we have created records in highway construction. We will not spare bad highway builders. We will ensure bank guarantees of such players are forfeited and they are not allowed to bid for new works,” he had said.",Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has ordered his ministry to conduct an ‘end-to-end investigation’ of both Sohna-Vadodara stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Jamnagar expressways.

'Link vehicle's insurance premium to challans': Delhi LG VK Saxena writes to FM Nirmala Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/link-vehicles-insurance-premium-to-challans-delhi-lg-writes-to-fm/articleshow/113669391.cms,"Delhi LG, VK Saxena has written to the Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to link insurance premiums of vehicles to the number of traffic violations recorded against the vehicle

NEW DELHI: Delhi Lieutenant Governor (LG) VK Saxena has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , advocating for a system that links vehicle insurance premiums to the number of traffic violations recorded against each vehicle. In his letter, Saxena underlined the critical importance of this proposal for enhancing road safety and promoting responsible driving behavior.""I am writing to your kind attention to a matter of critical importance concerning road safety and vehicular insurance in India,"" Saxena wrote. ""I would like to suggest for your consideration that insurance premiums should be index-linked with the number of traffic violations recorded against a vehicle, which would have a salutary impact on road safety and traffic discipline.""The proposal comes in the wake of alarming statistics from the ministry of road transport and highways ( MoRTH ), which reported over 437,000 road accidents in 2022, resulting in approximately 155,000 fatalities. Saxena noted that over-speeding accounted for nearly 70% of these accidents, while violations like red-light jumping also significantly contributed to fatalities.Analysis from the World Bank revealed that vehicles with multiple traffic violations have a 40% higher risk of being involved in fatal crashes compared to those with a clean record. This trend is echoed in Delhi’s own traffic statistics, with a 2023 report from the Delhi Traffic Police indicating that 60% of fatal road accidents involved vehicles previously fined for traffic violations, primarily over-speeding and red-light jumping.Saxena further explained, ""There is an obvious correlation between repeat traffic offences and the risk of accidents. I would therefore suggest that a layered insurance premium system based on the frequency and severity of traffic violations, as recorded in MoRTH's VAHAN database, may be introduced."" He proposed that vehicles frequently cited for offences such as over-speeding and dangerous driving should be subjected to higher insurance premiums as a financial deterrent to encourage safer driving habits.He cited examples from other countries where similar systems are in place. ""Such measures have been successfully implemented in other countries such as the United States, where insurance premiums increase significantly based on traffic violations and speeding tickets, leading to an average premium increase of 20 to 30%,"" he said. He also mentioned that several European nations have adopted similar practices.In his letter, Saxena requested the finance minister's intervention to initiate discussions with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ) to create a framework for implementing this system. ""Linking insurance premiums to traffic violations would not only align insurance costs with risk but also reduce the financial burden on insurers due to claims arising from frequent accidents,"" he added. ""This market-driven solution would encourage responsible driving, contribute to reduced road accidents, save lives, and ensure better management of insurance claims.""","Delhi Lieutenant Governor (LG) VK Saxena has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman advocating for a system that links vehicle insurance premiums to the number of traffic violations recorded against each vehicle.

Foodgrain output set to hit record 332 MT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foodgrain-output-set-to-hit-record-332-mt/articleshow/113682982.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Foodgrain production during the 2023-24 crop year is estimated to touch a new record of 332 million tonne (MT), which is higher by over 2 MT than the output of nearly 330 MT during 2022-23 despite ‘below normal’ monsoon rainfall last year, show data released by the agriculture ministry on Wednesday. The ministry during 2023-24 introduced digital techniques, using remote sensing data, for the estimation, claiming that new system has ensured “transparency and robustness” of the yield estimates.Though soil moisture stress during the Rabi season , due to less rainfall in certain states in 2023, impacted the production of pulses, coarse cereals, soybean, and cotton, the record production of paddy and wheat pushed the overall output of foodgrains to an all-time high of 332 MT.Rise in overall production despite less than normal rainfall in the country shows how drought-proofing of farming by gradually improving irrigation infrastructure has delinked the output of most of the crops to an extent from minor variations in monsoon rainfall, even as the quantitative and spatial distribution of seasonal rain continues to play a significant role in the country’s farming operations.The output of rapeseed and mustard — India’s major oilseed — also reported record production during 2023-24. The ministry attributed decline in production of pulses, coarse cereals, soybean and cotton in 2023-24 compared to previous year to the “drought-like conditions” in certain states, and “prolonged dry spell during August”, especially in Rajasthan. The estimates of the production of foodgrains, oilseeds and other crops have been primarily prepared on the basis of information received from states and UTs.""The crop area has been validated and triangulated with information received from Remote Sensing, Weekly Crop Weather Watch Group and other agencies. Crop yield estimates are majorly based on Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) conducted nationwide,"" said the ministry’s spokesperson while releasing final estimates for the year 2023-24.He said, ""The process of recording CCEs has been re-engineered with the introduction of the Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES), which was rolled out in major states during the 2023-24 agricultural years. The new system has ensured the transparency and robustness of the yield estimates.""",Foodgrain production during the 2023-24 crop year is estimated to touch a new record of 332 million tonne.

Modi's participation, however, is restricted to the SCO heads of state summit.India has mostly been represented by foreign ministers at heads of govt meetings. A decision on Jaishankar's participation is expected after his return from the US next week. The heads of govt meeting will take place in Oct 15-16. If Jaishankar does visit Islamabad, this will be the first visit by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in almost nine years.His predecessor Sushma Swaraj had visited Pakistan in Dec 2015 for another multilateral event, on the sidelines of which she also had a bilateral meeting with her Pakistan counterpart. Jaishankar had accompanied her as then foreign secretary. On this occasion, a formal bilateral meeting is unlikely even if Jaishankar goes, given the troubled relationship.Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari too had visited India last year for a meeting of SCO but there was no bilateral meeting then with his Indian counterpart. According to sources, any visit to Pakistan will be in line with SCO obligations. While the invite to India was more a formality than a peace outreach, it did open up possibility of a rare high-level visit from India.","India is likely to participate in the SCO heads of govt meeting that will be held next month.

Using information from the payment gateway they were able to track over 50 shell companies which were being used for the purpose and cracked down on them using controlled delivery and undercover operations, which was followed by areview of bank documents.The latest FATF report has highlighted a series of cases — from hawala to cash couriers and third-party money laundering — taken up by the agency as part of the efforts to crackdown on money laundering, which have been lauded by the global watchdog.A large majori ty come from “open sources”, followed by referrals from law-enforcement agencies and Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & System.Between 2018-19 and late 2023, the agency initiated 4,163 money laundering investigations, the report said. While the report pointed to prosecutions being low, it also noted that some of the cases were held up due to constitutional challenges in the Supreme Court. The authorities also told FATF that an additional 171 prosecution complaints are not progressing on account of pending international assistance based on requests made by India.Besides, steps are also taking steps to deal with human resources shortage with the number of ED prosecutors from 173 to 300 over the coming years.The report has also appreciated the steps related to confiscation, arguing that it deprives criminals of the proceeds and reduces the risk of asset flight apart from acting as a deterrent. In fact, the report has cited an example of seized virtual assets of Rs 14 crore being converted into fiat currency by ED through the court process.Between 2018 and 2023, the total value of proceeds related to money laundering probes seized by ED was estimated at over Rs 83,400 crore.The report also points to cases such as those related to Vijay Mallya ’s properties helping banks recover their dues. “India has demonstrated that it is highly capable of investigating complex multifaceted terror financing cases,” the report released Friday said."," Enforcement Directorate is keeping close tabs on social media and other channels to track offenders.

Congress return will bring back scams: PM’s dig at Gandhis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-return-will-bring-back-scams-pms-dig-at-gandhis/articleshow/113683089.cms,"PM Modi

CHANDIGARH/NEW DELHI: PM Modi brought land scams allegedly involving Robert Vadra and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda centrestage as he cautioned voters of Haryana that Congress ’s return would bring back scams of “kharchi-parchi sarkar”, a term BJP also used in its manifesto to target the rival over allegations of corruption and land scams during its term.“In Haryana, farmers’ land was looted, and the state was handed over to ‘dalals’ (middlemen) and ‘daamad’ (son-in-law),” Modi said referring to land deals during Hooda’s term as CM in which Vadra, husband of Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra, is an accused.Addressing his second poll meeting in Haryana, in Gohana in Sonipat district, PM Modi challenged Congress’s sincerity in making generous promises to farmers, saying the party had not implemented those promises in states where it was in office.Targeting the Gandhi family, PM Modi said this “royal family” of Congress was the most corrupt family in the country, and when the high command was corrupt, it gave a free licence for looting at the lower levels. The PM also attacked Congress over “internal feud” in the party, widely seen as a reference to former Union minister Kumari Selja’s sulk over the prominence bestowed on Hooda, her factional rival, and cautioned voters that similar intra-party feuds had paralysed Congress govts in Rajasthan and Karnataka.PM Modi said voting for Congress would mean putting Haryana’s development at risk. He also said if Congress came to office, no new investor would come to Haryana, and there would be no jobs for youngsters in the state.The rally at Gohana saw a large crowd, leading Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to attribute the turnout to the PM’s appeal.Slamming Congress for its “anti-reservation stance,” the PM said opposing quota was in the party’s DNA and emphasised that BJP had uplifted marginalised and backward communities in Haryana. He said BJP appointed Nayab Saini, a member of OBC community and the son of a farmer-labourer, as CM.He assured that if BJP returned to office in the state, new job opportunities would be created for the youth. He highlighted the potential of the Sonipat-Panipat belt, which he said was brimming with opportunities.","PM Modi warns voters of Haryana that Congress’s return would bring back scams of ‘kharchi-parchi sarkar’ Modi: ‘Farmers’ land was looted, and the state was handed over to middlemen’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113683084,imgsize-610428,width-400,resizemode-4/113683084.jpg"

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court ruled Wednesday that ED’s July 20 arrest of Congress’ Haryana MLA Surender Panwar in a money laundering case was “indefensible in law” and carried out in a manner that was “against the dignity of human rights”.Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu, who was hearing Panwar’s petition challenging his arrest, directed the central agency to sensitise its officers about the rights of anyone under investigation and take steps to avoid illegalities.“It would be appreciated if some necessary mechanism is put in place for fair investigation of the accused per basic human rights laid down by the United Nations,” the court said in a 37 page order.“The petitioner was issued notice/summons under Section 50 of the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) and (he) appeared in the zonal office of ED at Gurugram on July 19 at 11am...He was constantly interrogated for 14 hours and 40 minutes, which is not heroic on the part of ED.”Panwar, who is seeking re-election from Haryana’s Sonipat constituency, contends that he has been “falsely implicated on political grounds”.Justice Sindhu noted that the foundation of the case was illegal mining , which is not a scheduled offence under the PMLA. “Hence, prima facie, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted on that count.”ED’s counsel said the MLA’s arrest was based on available evidence about his links to a syndicate generating fakee-rawana bills for illegal mining, resulting in significant revenue loss to the state. The agency accused Panwar of receiving around Rs 26 crore as proceeds of the crime.",Congress' Haryana MLA Surender Panwar was arrested on July 20 in a money laundering case.

LUCKNOW: UP government has invoked Section 56 of the Food Safety and Standards Act ( FSSA ), 2006, for a statewide crackdown on sale of contaminated food, entailing a “verification process” that requires eateries to prominently display the names and addresses of their proprietors and managers.The order, issued nearly two months after Supreme Court put on hold a similar police notification applicable to Kanwar Yatra routes, will be enforced this time by joint teams of the state Food Safety and Drug Administration, police, and local administration.Action for any discrepancy will be initiated under the aegis of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ), the statutory licensing institution that regulates and supervises food safety countrywide, officials said.In its July 22 verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the Kanwar Yatra-linked notices by UP, Uttarakhand and MP, the court had ruled that police weren’t authorised to enforce any such order. “In furtherance to this, the competent authority may perhaps issue orders under the FSSA, 2006, and the Street Vendors Act, 2014. However, the legal powers vested on the competent authority (in this case, FSSAI) cannot be usurped by police without legal foundation,” the bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice SVN Bhatti said.The decision to revive the contentious move of having restaurant, dhaba and cloud kitchen operators display their names and addresses was taken at a meeting convened by CM Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow Tuesday to discuss reports of food contamination with human waste.A senior official said Yogi wanted the verification process to be completed swiftly. “The entire procedure is already well laid out in the relevant Act. It only needs to be enforced effectively,” he said. The CM ordered necessary “amendments to rules” and steps to enforce accountability by identifying and listing all establishments serving food, including cloud kitchens.Section 56 of the FSSA states, “Any person who, whether by himself or by any other person on his behalf, manufactures or processes any article of food for human consumption under unhygienic or unsanitary conditions, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to Rs 1 lakh.” If food adulteration leads to injury or death, the law provides for a jail sentence of six months to life, and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.The UP, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh govts had made it mandatory for food stalls and fruit vendors along the Kanwar Yatra routes to display the names of owners for transparency and to help pilgrims make “informed choices” about where to eat. The SC said the onus was on FSSAI to ensure pilgrims were served vegetarian food, conforming to their preferences and standards of hygiene.","Supreme Court had put on hold a similar police notification applicable to Kanwar Yatra routes.

Answer is not to close everything and shut the doors but to remind us that court proceedings go much beyond the four walls of the courtroom,"" the CJI-led bench said, indicating that transparency in judicial proceedings is key to sustain the immense faith the public reposes in it.Appealing to stakeholders, particularly judges, to refrain from making casual remarks while participating in court proceedings, the bench said, ""Casual observations may reflect a degree of individual bias, particularly when these are perceived to be directed against a particular community or gender."" ""Courts, therefore, have to be careful not to make comments which may be construed as misogynistic or prejudicial to certain sections of our society,"" it said.""We emphasise this point, as it is necessary for every stakeholder to understand that the values which must not die are the values enshrined in the Constitution (justice, liberty, equality and fraternity),"" the bench said.While closing suo motu proceedings on Karnataka HC Judge V Srishananda's unwarranted observations, the bench said the live streaming of court proceedings places an additional responsibility on all stakeholders to be conscious about the wider impact of casual observations on the country at large.The bench said, ""As judges, we are conscious of the fact that each individual bears a certain degree of accumulated predisposition based on experiences in their lives.

"Very healthy, very democratic: Foreign observers on J&K polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/very-healthy-very-democratic-foreign-observers-on-jk-polls/articleshow/113679402.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time, elections in Jammu and Kashmir are being held under global spotlight, with senior diplomats from 16 countries invited to observe voting at polling stations in the Union territory. The international observers on Wednesday voiced their validation of the polls, with the US diplomat describing them as “very healthy and very democratic” and the Singapore representative calling them “comparable” to elections in her country.“It is great to see the enthusiasm... to see Kashmiris voting after a pause of 10 years. We are very excited to see the results... It looks very healthy and very democratic,” US deputy chief of the mission in Delhi, Jorgan K Andrews, was quoted by PTI as saying.“I am glad that all the voters showed up. That’s wonderful to see,” said Singapore deputy head of the mission in Delhi, Cheng Wei Wei Alice. South Korean diplomat Sang Woo Lim said it was special to witness how democracy works and appreciated the idea of all-women ‘pink polling stations’.On the invitation of the external affairs ministry, senior diplomats from the US, South Korea, Spain, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Norway, Nigeria, Tanzania, the Philippines, Guyana, Somalia, Panama, Rwanda and Algeria toured polling stations in Ompora (Budgam) and Amira Kadal and S P College, Chinar Bagh, which falls in Lal Chowk assembly constituency. These polling stations had recorded very low turnouts in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.With a 61.4% turnout in Phase 1 and over 57% (provisional) in Phase 2, chief election commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar on Wednesday described the J&K elections as “history in the making”. He told reporters here, “The people of J&K are standing in long queues outside polling booths at places where boycott calls were once given. It is a standing ovation for democracy..It is history in the making, echoes of which will be heard for posterity.”Wednesday’s overall turnout was higher as compared to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls (52.2%) but lower than the 61.8% turnout recorded in the 2014 assembly polls in the same districts. Turnouts were higher across the Valley’s Budgam, Ganderbal and Srinagar districts as compared to 2024 LS polls, but significantly lower in Ganderbal and Budgam, when compared with the 2014 assembly polls. Though Srinagar district recorded a low turnout of around 29.8% (provisional), it is better than the 24.8% and 27.7% polling recorded in both 2024 LS elections and 2014 J&K polls respectively.In Jammu division, all three districts — Reasi, Rajouri and Poonch — recorded lower turnouts than the 2014 assembly polls. Polling in Rajouri and Poonch was better than in 2024 LS elections, but slightly lower in Reasi. While Reasi, where the decline was the sharpest since 2014, had seen a major terror attack in June with nine persons killed after terrorists fired on a bus, Rajouri and Poonch have seen fierce encounters between the security forces and terrorists in the recent months.Both US diplomat Andrews and Alice from Singapore on Wednesday said the J&K polls were similar to those in their respective countries, with the US using schools and Singapore, government buildings, for polling stations.South Korean diplomat Lim said: “It is my first time here in Kashmir. It is special to witness how democracy works. This idea of a pink polling station is very ingenuous. It is a great way to attract more people to come and vote”.","Senior diplomats from 16 countries invited to observe voting at polling stations in the Union territory.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday admonished Karnataka HC 's Justice V Srishananda for his controversial reference to a Bengaluru locality as ""Pakistan"" and his misogynistic comment aimed at a woman lawyer, but spared him of further embarrassment by closing suo motu proceedings as he had tendered an open court apology.A bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said, ""We have seen the nature of the (judge's) observations.One cannot call any part of the territory of India as Pakistan. That fundamentally is contrary to the territorial integrity of the nation.""The bench was unequivocal in saying the observations were gratuitous and ""should have been eschewed"" and that Srishananda was being spared a notice only for the sake of the dignity of the judiciary.Referring to a report on the judge's remark submitted to SC by HC registrar general in consultation with its chief justice, SC said, ""The report's text would amply indicate the observations, which were made during the proceedings, were unrelated to the course of proceedings.""Interestingly, the two top law officers, attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta , diverged on what to do with Srishananda. Venkataramani did not seem to favour a swift closure and in his report, in response to the bench's request for assistance on how to move forward, proposed an in-house inquiry to unravel the facts behind the controversy. If an in-house inquiry finds a judge unsuitable for holding the constitutional post, then the CJI may recommend the govt to remove him by bringing a motion before Parliament.Mehta, however, opposed such a move and said since the judge had tendered an apology on September 21 in open court and expressed regret, a day after the SC took suo motu cognisance of his unwarranted observations, the best course would be to close proceedings.Acknowledging SC’s concern over vitriolic comments on social media after Justice Srishananda’s observations went viral, Mehta said, “Social media cannot be controlled. The anonymity attached to social media makes it a very dangerous place.” Justices Chandrachud and Gavai agreed with Mehta.While closing the proceedings, the bench said, “Perception of justice to every segment of society is as important as the rendition of justice as an objective fact. Since the HC judge is not party to the proceedings, we desist from making any further observations except expressing our serious concern about both the reference to the gender and to a segment of the community.“Such observations are liable to be construed in a negative light, thereby impacting not only the court of the judge who expressed that but the wider judicial system,” it added.","Supreme Court admonished Karnataka HC's Justice V Srishananda for his controversial reference to a Bengaluru locality as ""Pakistan"" and his misogynistic comment aimed at a woman lawyer.
