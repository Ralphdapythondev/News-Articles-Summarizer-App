During her busy schedule, she visited Puri's Golden Beach and shared her thoughts and images from the visit.""There are places that bring us in closer touch with the essence of life and remind us that we are part of nature.Mountains, forests, rivers, and seashores appeal to something deep within us,"" President Murmu posted. ""As I walked along the seashore today, I felt a communion with the surroundings – the gentle wind, the roar of the waves, and the immense expanse of water. It was a meditative experience.""President Murmu also expressed how this connection with nature brought her profound inner peace, similar to her experience during her darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannathji. ""It brought to me a profound inner peace that I had also felt when I had a darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannathji yesterday. And I am not alone in having such an experience; all of us can feel that way when we encounter something that is far larger than us, that sustains us and that makes our lives meaningful,"" she wrote.She highlighted the disconnection of humankind from nature due to the hustle and bustle of daily life and the resulting environmental consequences. ""In the hustle and bustle of the daily grind, we lose this connection with Mother Nature. Humankind believes it has mastered nature and is exploiting it for its own short-term benefits. The result is for all to see. This summer, many parts of India suffered a terrible series of heatwaves. Extreme weather events have become more frequent around the globe in recent years. The situation is projected to be far worse in the decades to come,"" she said.President Murmu also pointed out the impact of global warming on oceans and coastal areas , saying, ""More than seventy percent of the surface of the earth is made up of oceans, and global warming is leading to a rise in global sea levels, threatening to submerge coastal areas. The oceans and the rich variety of flora and fauna found there have suffered heavily due to different kinds of pollution.""She concluded with a call for both large-scale and local efforts to protect and conserve the environment, highlighting the traditions of people living close to nature as a guiding example. ""Fortunately, people living in nature’s lap have sustained traditions that can show us the way. Inhabitants of coastal areas, for example, know the language of the winds and waves of the sea. Following our ancestors, they worship the sea as God.""""There are two ways, I believe, to meet the challenge of protection and conservation of the environment; broader steps that can come from governments and international organisations, and smaller, local steps that we can take as citizens. The two are, of course, complementary. Let us pledge to do what we can do – individually, locally – for the sake of a better tomorrow. We owe it to our children,"" she concluded in her posts.",President Droupadi Murmu is currently on a four-day visit to Odisha for the Jagannath Ratha Yatra and other events.

BENGALURU: The number of repeater-candidates seeking admission to MBBS and BDS courses through NEET in Karnataka has nearly doubled from 28,064 in 2023 to 53,616 this year. This shouldn't come as a surprise since the repeaters outperformed freshers in medical admissions last year: Of the 11,000 MBBS and BDS seats up for grabs in Karnataka last year, as many as 7,012 were secured by repeater-candidates.Repeater-candidates are those who would have written II PU or equivalent exam in years preceding the year they appear for NEET.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB.

Including weekends, students can expect a total of five off-days in July.Here's an overview-Muharram holds deep historical importance for both Sunni and Shia Muslims, as it commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. This event, marked by the Day of Ashura on the tenth day of Muharram, is a time of mourning and reflection for the Muslim community.

NEW DELHI: The colonial legacy of long summer vacations continues in the Supreme Court , but for the first time a record 20 benches were set up during the nearly two-month-long break this year and exhausted the list of cases to be taken up during this period with the consent of counsel for parties.For those unaware of the punishing work schedule of SC judges, often criticised for the long summer break of the court, CJI D Y Chandrachud said, ""People see us sitting in Supreme Court from 10.30am to 4pm daily, when we handle between 40 and 60 cases.The work we do between 10.30am and 4pm is a fraction of the work we do in order to be ready to deal with cases coming up for hearing the next day.""""Every judge spends an equal amount of time reading case files scheduled for the next day. Judgments are reserved on working days. On Saturdays, every judge sits down and dictates judgments. On Sundays, all of us read the cases listed for Monday.

"As China flexes muscles in SCS, India to host Quad drill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-china-flexes-muscles-in-scs-india-to-host-quad-drill/articleshow/111560343.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will host the top-tier Malabar naval exercise with the other `Quad’ countries, the US, Japan and Australia, in the Bay of Bengal this year, amid China’s continuing muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and expanding strategic footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).The 28th edition of the Malabar exercise, with a major focus on advanced anti-submarine warfare, will be conducted on India’s eastern seaboard in October to further enhance military interoperability among the four countries, defence sources told TOI.“Malabar will witness complex surface, anti-air and anti-submarine warfare drills, along with joint manoeuvres and advanced tactical exercises, to hone war-fighting skills. There is no plan to invite a fifth country for the exercise as of now,” a source said.The Malabar, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the US in 1992 and now includes Japan and Australia as regular participants, was held off Sydney in August last year. Japan, in turn, had hosted the exercise off Yokosuka in 2022.The Malabar this year will come shortly after India will also host its first-ever major multi-nation air combat exercise `Tarang Shakti’ in August-September. Apart from the Quad countries, air forces from other nations like the UK, France, Germany, UAE and Singapore will also participate in the exercise.An aggressive China figures high on the radar screens of most countries. With the world’s largest Navy with 355 warships and submarines, Beijing has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South China Sea, especially the Philippines, with expansionist territorial claims while also building several new artificial islands.Similar Chinese “grey zone” and salami-slicing tactics are evident along the land borders with India. There is also the major concern over China’s growing presence in the IOR, with Beijing hunting for additional logistical turn-around facilities on the east coast of Africa after establishing its first overseas base at Djibouti in August 2017.“China is making moves in several countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar and Comoros. Beijing, of course, has full access to Pakistan’s Gwadar and Karachi ports. Chinese warships, as part of anti-piracy escort forces, are also hanging around in the IOR for a longer time now,” a source said.Then, of course, Chinese survey and research vessels as well as satellite and missile-tracking ships are almost always present in the IOR to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations. “China is boosting its underwater domain awareness in the IOR in order to operate here with a much greater degree of efficiency,” he added.India, of course, has been steadily ramping up its military ties with the Quad and several other countries, both bilaterally as well as multilaterally. India also has military logistics agreements, which provide for reciprocal refuelling, repair and berthing facilities for warships and aircraft, with the US, Australia, France, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. A similar pact with Russia is now on the anvil.Ahead of the Malabar, India’s 6000-tonne multi-role stealth frigate INS Shivalik, on a long-range deployment to the South China Sea and North Pacific Ocean, and a P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft are currently participating in the world’s largest naval exercise RIMPAC at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. “RIMPAC is taking place 9,000 nautical miles from the Indian coast. An Indian submarine, INS Vagir, had also gone all the way to the west coast of Australia in an extended deployment last year for the first time,” another source said.“Malabar is all about the strong cooperation, shared values and the collective ability of the four nations to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, which China is trying to disrupt,” he added.","The 28th edition of the Malabar exercise, with a major focus on advanced anti- submarine warfare, will be conducted on India’s eastern seaboard in October.

He gave up his life to save others,” said an inconsolable Smriti Singh, the widow of Captain Anshuman Singh, while she stood before President Droupadi Murmu with folded hands to accept the Kirti Chakra , India’s second-highest gallantry honour, awarded posthumously to her husband on Friday for saving his fellow men's lives and trying to protect critical medical equipment during a fire incident at an Army dump on the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen Glacier.Captain Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen. On July 19, 2023, an ammunition dump caught fire in the dead of night. The Captain saw a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames and quickly acted to save those trapped inside. He successfully rescued several individuals, but while trying to save critical medical equipment from a medical investigation centre that also caught fire, he laid down his life.The Rashtrapati Bhavan statement said: “Disregarding his own safety, Captain Anshuman Singh exhibited exceptional bravery and resolve to rescue many people during a major fire incident in Siachen. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra (posthumously) for his act of conspicuous gallantry and sacrifice.” Smriti Singh, along with the Captain’s mother Manju Singh, received the award from the President.After receiving the Kirti Chakra, Smriti Singh, in a video posted by a defense ministry spokesperson, recalled, “He once told me, ‘I would die with the brass on my chest. I would not die an ordinary death’.”Recalling her first meeting with Captain Singh, Smriti said, “We met on the first day of college. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it was love at first sight. After a month, he got selected into the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). We met at an engineering college, but then he got selected for medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long years.”“Then we decided to get married. Unfortunately, within two months of our marriage, he got posted to Siachen,” she said.“On July 18, we had a long conversation about how our life was going to be in the next 50 years. We would build a house, have kids... On the morning of July 19, I got a call that he was no more. For the next 7-8 hours, we were not ready to accept that anything of this sort had happened. Now that I have the Kirti Chakra in my hand, maybe it is true. It’s okay; he’s a hero. We can manage our lives. But he gave his life to save the other three families, his army family,” Smriti said, trying to hold back her tears.After the incident last year, Captain Singh was cremated with full state honours in Bhagalpur in UP’s Deoria district, on July 22, 2023.President Murmu also presented 26 Shaurya Chakras, including seven posthumously, to personnel of the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, and state/UT police during a defence investiture ceremony.","Captain Anshuman Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen.

Controversy erupts over Rahul’s interaction with loco pilots as Northern Railway denies they were from Delhi Division,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/controversy-erupts-over-rahuls-interaction-with-loco-pilots-as-northern-railway-denies-they-were-from-delhi-division/articleshow/111557889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s interaction with loco pilots at the New Delhi station has snowballed into a big controversy after Northern Railway said the drivers were not from the Delhi Division. Officials said the loco pilots and crew members shown in the video posted by Congress were either from other divisions or were brought.However, the All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA) of South Zone said it’s immaterial to focus on which division the loco pilots were from as long as they have raised grievances that are common to all such divisions.“The issues raised by the crew members related to adequate rest and night duty concerns of everyone. So, it doesn’t matter crew members from which division raised the issue with the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha. We have also given a memorandum to him highlighting matters, including serious safety issues,” said R Kumaresan, president of South Zone AILRSA.Rahul’s visit to the station and interaction with train crew members came barely hours after railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw charged opposition parties of creating “false narratives” with old video clips and trying to “demotivate” railway personnel. He urged leaders to refrain from doing this.The video posted by Congress on its social media handle shows Rahul visiting the crew lobby, interacting with loco pilots and others, and trying to understand their issues.Hours later, spokesperson of Northern Railway, Deepak Kumar said, “Rahul Gandhi visited the railway station along with 7-8 cameramen. They visited the crew lobby and understood how it works. He interacted with loco pilots who were not from our lobby. It seems they were from outside or were brought. The camera persons were making some films and reels as well.”The video shared by Congress claims that the main complaint that loco pilots raised before Rahul was not getting enough rest, which is one of the main causes of accidents. It said they are demanding 46 hours’ rest in a week as per rules and shortage of loco pilots.Kumaresan said they had written to leaders of political parties, including Rahul, highlighting their issues. They were informed on Friday that he would meet loco pilots. “We had a meeting here and hence there were people from different divisions. We had written to the railway minister and Railway Board chairperson. Honouring their words that our grievances would be resolved we had withdrawn agitation. But there is no progress so far,” he added.Highlighting the plight of train drivers, the memorandum note given to Rahul mentions that loco pilots, especially those who drive goods trains, work 14-16 hours a day and get to go home after three or four days. It said drivers work for more than four consecutive nights and instead of getting weekly rest, they are given rest once in 10 days.The memorandum also said that a railway task force on safety in 2017 found that overshooting of red signals happens mostly when loco pilots return after “inadequate weekly rest”. It said, “Whereas all staff are entitled to a weekly rest between 40 and 64 hours but loco pilots are entitled to only 30.”",The All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA) of South Zone said it’s immaterial to focus on which division the loco pilots were from as long as they have raised grievances.

It is taking place after a gap of three years. We have the tradition of the annual exchange of summit-level meetings between the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of India and the last one was in 2021.

But, I can certainly tell you that the visit is in the framework of our annual exchange of the Presidential and Prime ministerial visit that we have in world summits and so the context is bilateral.

Later, speaking to TOI, Singh said, ""A few eyewitnesses have reached out to me anonymously and disclosed that there were 15-16 individuals carrying cans filled with poisonous substances. They opened these among the crowd. I have seen post-mortem reports of those killed, which showed that they died of asphyxiation and not because of injuries.""Addressing the press conference, Singh had termed the incident ""a conspiracy against Bhole Baba."" ""The miscreants, dressed in half-pants and scarves, were seen running in the crowd, spraying the poisonous substance from the cans. Eyewitnesses said women were falling to the ground because of this. These individuals were seen fleeing and boarding cars soon after,"" he alleged.He added, ""I met some women in hospital after the incident, and they told me they saw unidentified men running in the crowd, spreading this spray. People fell to the ground, and others trampled over them. It was a pre-planned mass murder. The conspiracy was hatched to malign Baba, whose popularity among people has been rising.""Singh urged the police to seize CCTV footage from toll booths to identify the car registration numbers of the miscreants. He also shared several documents showing the permission granted by the Hathras administration for the event.Nine people, including the main accused - chief organiser Devprakash Madhukar - have been arrested in connection with the stampede so far. Officials said Madhukar was not only the organiser but also the fundraiser of the satsang, where more than 2.5 lakh people had gathered, three times above the permitted limit of 80,000.

NEW DELHI: The special cell of the Delhi Police has registered a case against Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra for her derogatory remarks against National Commission of Women (NCW) chief Rekha Sharma , officials said on Sunday.An FIR was registered in the matter after the Women's Commission had lodged a complaint with the Delhi police on July 5.As per media reports, the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit of the Delhi Police Special Cell will be investigating the matter.On July 4, NCW chief Rekha Sharma went to Hathras to meet the women who were injured in the tragic stampede that claimed 121 lives. Videos showed the NCW chief at the stampede site with someone holding an umbrella for her.Reacting to the video, several users on social media wondered why the NCW chief could not hold the umbrella herself.The TMC MP triggered a major row after she reacted to one such post and took potshots at the NCW chief.""She’s too busy holding up her boss's pajamas,"" Moitra had written, attacking Rekha Sharma, who is often accused by opposition parties of working for and at the behest of the BJP-led NDA government.The commission reacted strongly to the TMC leader's ""derogatory, crude"" remarks and sought strict action against her and filed an FIR on July 5.Moitra's remarks evoked strong reaction from Rekha Sharma, who called the TMC MP a ""troll"".""She is not interested in her work but just trolling people, and I don't give my time to trollers,"" the NCW chief said attacking Mahua Moitra. Rekha Sharma also clarified about the incident and said she was not inside the umbrella.

"Yesterday once more: Cities decide time can't stand still, get historic clocks ticking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yesterday-once-more-cities-decide-time-cant-stand-still-get-historic-clocks-ticking/articleshow/111561477.cms,"Repairs can cost ₹3L per clock, crowdfunding makes it all tick

Guardians of Time:

Ticks of Their Hands:

Chimes of Time:

In Kolkata, a city where the past is revered and the future eagerly awaited, the passage of time strikes a delicate balance between the ticking of modern timepieces and the resonant chimes of British-era public clocks. Perched high on stately buildings, these clocks mark the pulse of daily life.These historic clocks evoke a sense of nostalgia, inviting passers-by to pause and reflect.A traffic constable recently stopped under the shadow of the pristine white St Andrew's Church, struck by a familiar sound - the rhythmic gongs, dormant for over a decade, cascading through Dalhousie Square. ""Hearing this sound after many years,"" he said.A traffic constable who recently stopped under the shadow of the pristine white St Andrew's Church was struck by a familiar sound from the rhythmic gongs of a clock manufactured by James McCabe Royal Exchange of London in 1835.The clock's chiming mechanism had fallen silent more than 10 years ago, its stillness contrasting with the unceasing flow of life. Thanks to the concerted efforts of Kolkata Restorers, a citizens' collective bound by a shared passion for their city, the clock now stands revived, adding to the allure of the historic precinct.Kolkata Restorers has engaged restoration specialists Swapan Dutta and his son Satyajit to nurse defunct clocks back to health, one chime at a time. Among the notable timepieces the father-son duo maintains is a clock along the banks of the Ganga at Har ki Pauri in Haridwar, dating back to 1938. Another, a four-faced clock at Government Senior Secondary School in Kapurthala, installed 161 years ago by Maharaja Jagjit Singh, owes its continued operation to their meticulous care. They also maintain a clock at the Patna secretariat, installed in 1924. ""Repairing and overhauling a mechanical clock is a labour of love,"" said Swapan. ""Most of these clocks are of British or German origin. Though they have withstood the passage of time, some parts inevitably wear out and need replacing. We replace bushes, fabricate missing parts, fix alignments, and set the teeth and interlocking systems right to breathe life back into these clocks.""The Duttas' lineage of clockmakers spans five generations and nearly 200 years, beginning with Swapan's great-grandfather Dharani Dhar Dutta. ""He repaired large public clocks and grandfather clocks in aristocratic homes,"" Swapan said. Their workshop on Madan Gopal Lane near Kolkata Medical College and Hospital showcases the rhythmic ticking and tocking of mechanisms, a tribute to the Duttas' dedication to their craft.Kolkata Restorers, comprising people from various walks of life, is on a mission to resurrect the forgotten melodies of Kolkata's past. It started with a plan to illuminate some prominent buildings in the city, but the sight of dysfunctional clocks spurred them to action. ""When we illuminated a building with a clock, it enhanced the imperfection of the dysfunctional clock. We thus felt we had to work on the clocks,"" recalled Mudar Patheria, a member of the group.Crowd-funding has been instrumental in their efforts, gathering contributions to cover repair costs, which can exceed Rs 3 lakh. They have successfully restored clocks at Sacred Heart Church, Dharmatala, and are working on others at Holy Trinity Church and Magen David Synagogue. Next on their radar are clocks at Our Lady of Dolours Church in Sealdah and the GPO, which has remained silent for years.Architect Abin Chaudhuri, another member, highlighted the importance of preserving the historical quarter of Dalhousie Square, where St Andrew's Church is located. ""Dalhousie Square includes Writers' Building (from where the British governed India for two centuries); GPO (India's first general post office); and Old Telegraph Office (known as Dead Letter Building as it stores letters that had for some reason never been delivered)...,"" Chaudhuri said.According to direct tax consultant Miraj Shah, the endeavour was to add value to the city instead of complaining about things that govt or the civic body wasn't doing. ""It is a demonstration that a little bit of money with proper intent, time and effort can bring about change,"" he said.Public clocks across the urban landscape serve as timeless keepers of history. Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Port, formerly Kolkata Port Trust, maintains three historic clocks. The first, at its headquarters in Dalhousie Square, was set up in 1877 by Flerken Smith & Sons. The second, at Indenture Memorial in Kidderpore Port, was made in 1899 by Cooke & Kelvey of London. The third, at Netaji Subhas Dock, was made in 1928 by Flerken Smith & Sons and has served as a timekeeper for nearly a century.In Darjeeling, the iconic turret clock at Capitol Hall, the historic seat of Darjeeling Municipality, mirrors the immutable flow of time. Originally installed by GT Gent and Co of the UK in the 1920s, it suffered damage in a 1996 fire and was later restored by Rotary Club of Darjeeling. These timeless keepers of time bend under the weight of history, much like Dali's fluid clocks, yet persist like Pink Floyd's haunting melody that captures the seconds, minutes, and hours: ""Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day.""(inputs from Roshan Gupta, Siliguri)","Kolkata Restorers is a citizens' collective bound by a shared passion for their city.

Telangana has a large Congress majority and it is sure to win the seat.After its debacle in the December 2023 state elections and its setbacks post-2014, Congress's tally in the upper House has slipped drastically. After the last round of Rajya Sabha elections, Congress barely retained the leader of opposition's post, which is occupied by party president Mallikarjun Kharge.The party's strength in Rajya Sabha till the 2024 Lok Sabha elections stood at 28, while the 10% seats that enable the principal opposition party to claim the LoP position is 25.As the party appeared to have barely retained the requisite numbers, the parliamentary elections saw the victory of two Rajya Sabha members - K C Venugopal and Deepender Hooda - and their resignations from the RS has brought down the Congress tally to 26.The biggest concern over this change was its implication for the key perch that allows the Congress president to have a leadership role in Parliament. A buffer of one seat appeared very shaky. At the same time, the byelections to be called on the seats vacated by Venugopal and Hooda will benefit BJP which governs Rajasthan and Haryana.It is here that Rao's crossing over to his erstwhile party will increase the Congress comfort over the LoP's position.While Rao may return to the RS from Telangana for the remainder term of two years as a Congress member, his appointment in Hyderabad as adviser to the state govt on Sunday has led to talk that he may be replaced by Abhishek Singhvi.A political veteran, Rao was Andhra Pradesh Congress president and later became a senior leader in Telangana Congress.

‘No action initiated against Kolkata CP on governor’s complaint’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-mha-action-initiated-against-kolkata-dc-on-governors-complaint/articleshow/111560390.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid media reports that the home ministry had started disciplinary proceedings against Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and DCP Indira Mukherjee for alleged misconduct, MHA sources said the Centre could not initiate action unilaterally against IPS officers serving in a state as the disciplinary authority competent to do so was the CM of the state concerned, as per rules governing All-India Services, including IPS.Sources said while the home ministry has received a complaint from West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose alleging that Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Indira Mukherjee had engaged in misconduct and were functioning in a manner ""unbecoming"" of members of all-India services, it has not yet moved forward on it. ""No disciplinary proceedings have been initiated,"" a home ministry officer told TOI.As per All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, and All-India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, the disciplinary authority for a member of All-India Services including IPS who is serving under the state govt is the state govt itself. MHA, being the cadre-controlling authority, can request a state govt, in case a complaint of misconduct is received against IPS officers, to initiate disciplinary proceedings as per service rules. The state govt may refuse to do so, denying outright any misconduct on part of the said officer, or go through with the disciplinary proceedings, which may end in the officer's exoneration. The MHA may also summon the officer serving in a state for an explanation or even recall him/her to the Centre, but for both these actions the state must give permission or relieve the said officer.In the past few years, there have been cases where the Centre has sought disciplinary action against officers serving in West Bengal after finding their conduct to be in violation of service rules. Two such officers were then West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, an IAS officer who was recalled to the Centre in 2021 after he failed to attend a review meeting on Cyclone Yaas taken by PM Narendra Modi, and then Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar against whom MHA sought disciplinary proceedings in 2019 for sitting on a dharna alongside CM Mamata Banerjee.However, no harm came to either officer as the state govt stood firmly by them. Bandyopadhyay was never relieved by the West Bengal govt even after being recalled. Kumar, considered close to Banerjee, went on to become DGP of West Bengal; in fact, the EC had removed him from the DGP's post during the recent Lok Sabha polls, keeping in mind his proximity to the CM, which it saw as an impediment to free and fair elections in the state.Given the background, the MHA may be contemplating its limited options vis-a-vis action on Bengal governor's complaint against Goyal and Mukherjee.","The home ministry has received a complaint from West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose alleging that Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal and deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Indira Mukherjee had engaged in misconduct.
