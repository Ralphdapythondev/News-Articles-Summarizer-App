"Amiable, articulate & pragmatic communist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amiable-articulate-pragmatic-communist/articleshow/113307967.cms,"Sitaram Yechury , who died on Thursday, was party politically a committed communist but in political praxis — to use a term much favoured by Marxist pundits — he favoured pragmatism over dogma. And like many pragmatic politicians of his generation, he was courteous and amiable, qualities that didn’t depend on which side of the aisle his interlocutor belonged to.He was among the few CPM leaders who didn’t ideologically over-analyse whether the party should ally with Congress , earlier identified as communists’ chief adversary, to take on BJP when the latter became a governing party under Vajpayee’s leadership.During the 2024 campaign, he insisted Modi-led BJP should be taken on in state-by-state contests, via alliances. An analysis partly borne out by results. Interestingly, CPM’s ideological purists still don’t formally acknowledge the party’s alliance with Congress, never mind that CPM is a part of INDIA bloc .That Yechury, as a student politician, had forced Indira Gandhi to step down as JNU chancellor made his later pragmatism all the more noticeable. That he stayed away from Naxalites in 1970s, because that offshoot of Marxist politics declared loyalty to China’s communists, was another indication of his practical political sense. As he said in 2014, when Modi took office for the first time: “Conditions have changed, so our analysis and alignment accordingly will change”.If some assessments of his pragmatism compare him to the other practical communist, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, an astute alliance builder, it should be noted that the difference in the success rate of the two is explained largely by CPM having been in a politically more commanding position during Surjeet’s heydays.Yechury’s easygoing nature wasn't a later day political makeover. Even as a student activist he wasn't known for being overbearing or loudly declaratory. Engaging in debates was his style, and witty one-liners were his rhetorical signature. Many politicians, including communists, are given to ranting. Yechury never was. The other standout feature was unlike many fellow Marxists, he avoided jargon. Again, unlike doctrinaire Marxists, he was always interested in not just class but also social groups and religion. He understood the latter were valuable in understanding Indian society.Telugu was his mother tongue. In the party forum and in meetings, he preferred English because he felt that political formulation came more easily to him in that language. But he gave public speeches in Hindi. During his two-term stint in the Rajya Sabha from Bengal, he tried to speak in Bengali during his conversations with Bengali journalists.Born to a Telugu Brahmin family, Yechury had refused to wear the sacred thread and chant slokas. He said he was the first communist in his family. But he didn’t discount philosophical debates embedded in the ancient religious texts. An open-mindedness that later helped him debate the Hindu Right.Those who knew him well said one of Yechury’s defining qualities as a politician was that he was more interested in finding commonalities than divergences between parties and groups. These attributes served him well in Parliament, where his articulation stood out as the general quality of parliamentary interventions worsened. When he ended his Rajya Sabha term in 2017, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav’s tribute stood out. But he wasn’t the only MP who felt the House would miss Yechury.Of course, as the Left’s electoral footprint shrank, so did the national political importance of CPM leaders, including Yechury. The high point was between 2004 and 2008 — from the time UPA-1 was formed till when CPM withdrew support to Manmohan Singh ’s govt over the Indo-US nuclear deal.It’s rare for Indian politicians, including communists, to introspect publicly. But Yechury proved an exception when, after UPA-2 took office, he admitted that his party hadn’t been able to explain its stand on the nuclear deal to voters, who gave a Congressled coalition a healthy victory. He was perhaps the only politburo member to do so.Losing Bengal to TMC dealt a blow to CPM and its leaders they haven't recovered from. Yechury, along with other CPM leaders, rarely made national headlines.But his international communist connections did make him very relevant when in 2009, UPA govt took his help to contact Nepal's Maoist leader Prachanda, who later became PM.Yechury’s last public message came the day he was shifted from the ICU to a general bed at AIIMS, Delhi. The recorded message was his tribute to another communist stalwart, former chief minister of Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, who passed away recently.Yechury was dealing with a deeply personal tragedy when he fell ill. He lost his son Ashish to Covid in 2021. He was never quite the same after that, those close to him said. The father in him was bereft. But it speaks to his abilities as a politician that the pragmatic communist in him soldiered on.",Sitaram Yechury was a committed communist but in political praxis he favoured pragmatism over dogma. He was among the few CPM leaders who didn’t ideologically over-analyse whether the party should ally with Congress to take on BJP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113307947,imgsize-648270,width-400,resizemode-4/113307947.jpg"

Viewed as a veiled threat, the party eventually announced Vikash as the nominee from Kalayat a day later. The other aspirant Shweta Dhull bitterly posted on X, ""A king's son becomes the king, that's the truth.""On the last day, Pooja Chaudhry, wife of Ambala MP Varun Chaudhry, got the Congress nomination from Mulana reserved constituency. Left out in the process, sources said, was Karamvir Singh Baudh, chairman of SC/ST/OBC confederation of employees.

Ticket denials spark Haryana BJP revolts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ticket-denials-spark-haryana-bjp-revolts/articleshow/113307528.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rebellion by functionaries who have been denied tickets and unprecedented public criticism of the leadership have added to the tough challenge BJP was already facing in Haryana because of a decade of incumbency.The washing of dirty organisational linen in public follows the dip in the party's fortunes since the 2019 elections when it swept the 10 Lok Sabha seats despite having been in office for five years in a state which was never its stronghold.Factors which helped the party in 2019, mainly PM Modi's popularity, failed to stop BJP from losing majority and it was forced to take the support of Dushyant Chautala 's JPP to form the govt. Signs of fatigue were visible in the LS polls when the party could win only five seats. If this was not worrisome enough, the outbreak of dissidencehas aggravated matters.Soon after BJP announced its second list of 21 candidates, several prominent leaders quit the party which included former deputy speaker Santosh Yadav, state BJP spokesperson Satyavrat Shastri and state executive committee member Shiv Kumar Mehta. In its second list, the party dropped five-time MLA from Mahendragarh Ramvilas Sharma , who will now contest as a rebel candidate.Union minister and Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh, who has been vocal against the state leadership even as his daughter Arti Singh Rao has been fielded from Ateli, came out in Sharma's support. Bhiwani-Mahendragarh MP Dharambir Singh was present with Rao when he addressed a gathering in Mahendragarh with Sharma.BJP has dropped around one-third of MLAs and some state leaders have claimed that CM Nayab Saini had a ""limited role"" in selection of candidate.Party leader Karan Dev Kamboj said the rebellion could have been prevented if Saini had a say in the allocation process. Kamboj, a former minister, had last week stepped down as the state unit's OBC Morcha chief after being denied ticket.On Tuesday, state unit vice-president Santosh Yadav quit, saying grassroots leaders who had been loyal to the party were being neglected. Yadav, a former deputy speaker, was said to be eyeing the ticket from Ateli constituency.","BJP has dropped around one-third of MLAs and some state leaders have claimed that CM Nayab Saini had a ""limited role"" in selection of candidate.

Demolition definite, if found illegal: Minister

It's govt's failure: LOP

SHIMLA : Defying prohibitory orders, thousands of protesters seeking demolition of an allegedly illegally constructed mosque in Sanjauli area of the state capital clashed with the police on Wednesday. The police had to resort to mild lathi charge besides using water cannons to disperse them after they broke barricades and pelted stones.A few protesters as well as cops were injured during the police action and they were taken to hospital for treatment.Various Hindu outfits, including the Hindu Jagran Manch, went ahead with their planned protest at Sanjauli despite Shimla district magistrate's prohibitory orders issued on Tuesday barring gathering of five or more persons and deployment of heavy police force in the area. Initially, protesters from Shimla and nearby districts carrying national flags and raising slogans "" Jai Shri Ram "" and ""Hindu Ekta Zindabad"" gathered at Dhalli Sabzi Mandi, from where they started marching towards the disputed five-storey mosque in Sanjauli.They first broke the police barricades erected near the Dhalli tunnel to march ahead but the police had to resort to cane charging and use water cannons after they broke the second line of barricades to reach the mosque.The police also had to detain a few miscreants and by 4 pm, shops started opening in the Sanjauli market as the situation became normal and the police also withdrew some of its personnel from the area.Many school students had to face harassment due to the ongoing protest and some of the schools had to hold back students in the school premises till the situation became normal.Himachal public works minister Vikramaditya Singh said on Wednesday if the Shimla municipal commissioner's court finds the mosque's construction illegal, it would definitely be demolished but the state govt is bound to follow the rule of law.The minister said that he had already made it clear in the vidhan sabha with complete facts of the case. He asserted the Congress govt is very sensitive towards the cause of the state's people and it stands with them rock solid. He added that the case regarding illegal construction of the mosque is pending for the last 10 years in the Shimla municipal commissioner's court during which the BJP ruled the state for five years and Shimla's mayor had also been from the BJP as well as the CPI(M). The case is listed for next hearing on October 5.Stating that there had been an attempt to paint a different picture in this episode at the state as well as the national level, the minister clarified that it is a matter of fact that Himachal was the first state in the country to implement an anti-conversion law in 2006 when his father, Virbhadra Singh was the chief minister of a Congress govt. The Congress govts have sanctioned crores for the construction and renovation of temples across the state, he asserted. ""We can have our sentiments. I am proud to be a Sanatani. I am proud to be a Hindu and I have gone to Ayodhya on January 22 to seek blessings of Prabhu Shri Ram. But the govt's action has to be within the ambit of law,"" he cleared, adding that Himachal is not a banana republic.Former chief minister and the leader of opposition Jai Ram Thakur said the use of force and water cannons on the people protesting for their genuine demands was very unfortunate. He added that when it was known that the mosque's construction was illegal, then the appropriate action should have been taken rather than trying to hurt public sentiments by talking of dealing with them strictly.He said that the state govt took this issue with extreme insensitivity and the legally required action was not taken under the Congress high command's pressure. Thakur said that it was a failure of the entire intelligence system as huge crowds from all over the state gathered in Sanjauli.",Thousands of protesters seeking demolition of an allegedly illegally constructed mosque in Sanjauli area of the state capital clashed with the police on Wednesday.

"'Used foreign land to defame …': Sikh groups protest outside Sonia Gandhi's residence against Rahul's remarks in US, demand apology",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/used-foreign-land-to-defame-sikh-leaders-of-bjp-march-to-rahul-gandhis-residence-over-turban-remarks-demand-apology/articleshow/113261271.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikh leaders from Delhi BJP's Sikh cell on Wednesday staged a protest against leader of opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after his remarks on the Sikh community in the US caused a political uproar back here in India.The demonstrators gathered near Gandhi's residence at 10 Janpath, chanting slogans and carrying placards as they attempted to march from Vigyan Bhawan.However, the police intervened and stopped them before they could reach the residence.Several Sikh leaders, women, and BJP members participated in the protest, with many being detained by the police.BJP leader RP Singh, who was among those detained, demanded an apology from Rahul for his comments abroad. ""Rahul Gandhi should apologise. He used foreign soil to defame India and made a statement suggesting that Sikhs are not allowed to wear their turbans or visit gurdwaras,"" Singh told ANI.The protesters accused Rahul of 'humiliating' the Sikh community and held the Congress party ‘responsible’ for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.This comes after a practicing lawyer at the Supreme Court Vineet Jindal filed a complaint with against the Congress leader for his remarks.""The statement of Rahul Gandhi is not right, and there have been no incidents reported where any Sikh is being stopped from visiting a Gurdwara or to wear the turbans, but Rahul Gandhi, for his political benefit, is trying to instigate the minorities. Earlier also, we witnessed how Rahul Gandhi defameed his own country instead of attacking the central government,"" Jindal said.""I have complained to Union home minister Amit Shah, NIA, and Delhi Police Commissioner. In which I have urged all of them to register the case for making false and inciteful statements. I have also urged them to cancel Rahul Gandhi's passport. I believe that soon action will be taken on my complaint,"" he added.During a recent gathering of Indian Americans in Washington, DC, Rahul Gandhi criticised the RSS for promoting a divisive agenda that considers certain religions, languages, and communities ‘inferior’ to others.In a moment that has since drawn significant criticism, Rahul addressed a Sikh attendee at the event, asking, ""What is your name, brother with the turban?"" He went on to say, ""The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, or a kada. Or if, as a Sikh, he will be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, but for all religions.""The BJP has since denounced these remarks, accusing Gandhi of creating a ""dangerous narrative"" by discussing sensitive issues on an international platform and undermining India's unity.",Sikh leaders from Delhi BJP's Sikh cell staged a protest against leader of opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

75% of India's 'disengagement problems' in eastern Ladakh resolved: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/75-of-indias-disengagement-problems-in-eastern-ladakh-resolved-jaishankar/articleshow/113303570.cms,"NEW DELHI: Describing India's ties with China as complex, foreign minister S Jaishankar said roughly 75% of India's "" disengagement problems "" in eastern Ladakh were resolved and India could look at ""other possibilities"" if the disengagement process was fully completed and peace and tranquility restored on the border.Jaishankar, however, said the two countries were faced with a bigger issue of militarisation of border that has affected the entirety of their ties because ""you can't have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it"".Foreign minister Jaishankar has said in the past that the standoff in eastern Ladakh, which started in May 2020, was about forward deployment, and not land grab.""We made some progress in the ongoing negotiations. I would say roughly you can say about 75% of the disengagement problems are sorted out,"" he said, speaking at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy in Switzerland. ""We hope that if there is a solution to the disengagement and there is a return to peace and tranquility, then we can look at other possibilities,"" he added.Ties between the two countries are yet to normalise in the absence of disengagement at a couple of remaining friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The minister also said what happened in 2020 was a violation of multiple agreements for reasons which were still not entirely clear to India. ""We can only speculate about it. The Chinese actually moved a very large number of troops to the LAC at the border and naturally in response, we moved our troops up. It was very difficult for us because we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown at that time,"" he said, describing the development as dangerous.""Now, we could see straightaway that this was a very dangerous development because the presence of a large number of troops in these extreme heights and extreme cold in near proximity could lead to a mishap. And that's exactly what happened in June 2022,"" he said, referring to the Galwan Valley clashes . Jaishankar said the issue for India was why China disturbed peace and tranquility and why it moved those troops and how to deal with this very ""close-up situation"".""We have now been negotiating close to four years and the first step of that is what we called disengagement which is their troops go back to their normal operating bases and our troops go back to their normal operating bases and where required we have an arrangement about patrolling because both of us patrol regularly in that border, as I said it is not a legally delineated border,"" he said.","India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said roughly 75% of India's "" disengagement problems "" in eastern Ladakh were resolved.

Bulldozer justice like bulldozing laws of land: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bulldozer-justice-like-bulldozing-laws-of-land/articleshow/113304869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that government authorities indulging in ' bulldozer justice ' amounts to ""running a bulldozer over the laws of the land"", Supreme Court on Thursday held that such actions are against the law and said involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property.This is the second time this month that the court has come down heavily on demolition of property of those accused in various crimes.On September 2, an SC bench had said law does not permit the destruction of the family shelters of even convicts, and agreed to frame guidelines to be followed across all states to prevent arbitrary demolitions.The practice, which was initiated by Uttar Pradesh government as a punitive measure against accused persons, is being replicated by others, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.On Thursday, hearing the plea of a family from Gujarat whose home the municipal authorities had threatened to bulldoze, a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and S V N Bhatti strongly disapproved of the practice. It said the entire family could not be punished by demolishing the house for the offence allegedly committed by one member.""The court cannot be oblivious to such demolition threats, inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme,"" it said. Such actions, ""may be seen as running a bulldozer over the laws of the land"", it added.In a country where actions of the State are governed by the rule of law, the transgression by a family member cannot invite action against other members of the family or their legally constructed residence. Alleged involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property. Moreover, the alleged crime has to be proved through due legal process in a court of law.”Agreeing to hear the petition, the bench issued notice to the Gujarat govt and restrained the municipal authority from taking any action against the property.Senior advocate Iqbal Syed, appearing for the petitioner, placed before the bench the revenue record of the property to show that there was no illegality in the construction of the house in which the family has been living for the past two decades. He also referred to the resolution passed in 2004 by the gram panchayat which granted permission to build the residential house.The municipal body allegedly threatened to demolish the house after a criminal case was registered against one of the family members. The petitioner alleged that the law should take its own course against the person accused of the crime but the whole family should not be punished.“But the Nagar Palika or others in the shadow of the Nagar Palika, should have no reason to either threaten or to take any steps such as using bulldozer, to demolish the legally constructed and legally occupied house/residence of the petitioner,” the petition said.After a brief hearing, the apex court granted interim relief and posted the hearing after four weeks. “In the meantime, status quo in respect of the petitioner’s property is to be maintained by all concerned,” it noted.","The practice was initiated by Uttar Pradesh government as a punitive measure against accused persons. It is being replicated by others, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Alleged involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113305244,imgsize-1049101,width-400,resizemode-4/113305244.jpg"

BJP hits back at opposition

NEW DELHI: Major political row erupted after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the residence of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud for Ganesh Puja.Several opposition leaders have criticized the meeting, suggesting that it may raise doubts about the independence of the judiciary. The BJP , however, has strongly defended the Prime Minister's visit, calling the opposition's criticism ""unfortunate"". PM Modi on Wednesday visited the residence of CJI on the occasion of Ganesh festival and offered prayers. A video showed Chandrachud and his wife Kalpana Das welcoming Modi at their house.PM also shared a picture on X, showing them praying together, and expressed his wishes for happiness, prosperity, and good health.""Joined Ganesh Puja at the residence of CJI, Justice DY Chandrachud Ji. May Bhagwan Shri Ganesh bless us all with happiness, prosperity and wonderful health,"" the Prime Minister said.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut questioned the appropriateness of the meeting, stating that people may have doubts if the guardians of the Constitution meet political leaders.“Our case is going on before CJI Chandrachud. We have doubts whether we will get justice because the Centre is a party in our case and the (central) government is headed by the prime minister,” Raut said.“The CJI has repeatedly said that the government is unconstitutional but still a judgment is not given despite his retirement is nearing. Amid this, the prime minister has reached his residence. There is doubt in the minds of people when “protectors of the Constitution meet political people”, he added.Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal said those who held the highest office should not publicise a private event.""I saw something being circulated on social media and, quite frankly, I was taken aback. I have been in the Supreme Court and in this institution for over 50 years. I have seen the greatest of judges, both past and present, and we are passionate about the institution.""""I have great respect for the present Chief Justice. I can say without any hesitation that he is a man of great personal integrity. I was really surprised when I saw this clip that was going viral,"" he said at a press conference.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also took a dig at the Prime Minister's visit, linking it to the upcoming elections.""After the festivities are over hopefully CJI will deem fit and be slightly freer to conclude the hearing on Maharashtra and the blatant disregard of Article 10 of the Constitution in Maharashtra. Oh wait, elections round the corner anyway, it can be adjourned for another day,"" she said.NCP (SP) Working President Supriya Sule said that when she learnt of the development.""Both - PM and CJI - are senior to me in terms of age and experience, so it will not be appropriate to comment."" ""But such an incident (PM visiting CJI's house) was unheard of. I was also surprised, but I have full faith in courts and the respected CJI might have given it a thought before (inviting the PM),"" she told reporters in her constituency Baramati.Manoj Jha, an RJD leader and Rajya Sabha MP, told news agency PTI that the independence of every institution should not only be theoretical but also visible."" Ganpati puja is a personal issue, but you are taking a camera. The message it sends is uncomfortable. The Chief Justice of India and the Prime Minister are tall personalities. So what can we say if they agreed to put out these photographs in the public domain,"" he said.BJP leaders strongly defended the Prime Minister's visit, emphasizing that it was a devoted Ganesh Puja and not mere socializing.Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Milind Deora criticized the opposition's comments, labelling them ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible"".""When verdicts favour them, the opposition praises the Supreme Court's credibility, but when things don't go their way, they conveniently claim the judiciary is compromised,"" he said in a post on X.""This reckless attempt to undermine the credibility of the CJI by the opposition is not only irresponsible but also damaging to the institution's integrity. India's politics is taking an ugly turn,"" Deora said.BJP IT-cell chief Amit Malviya also hit back at BJP and accused Congress of having ""problem with Hindu festivals""""The entire Congress and Communist ecosystem is in a twist after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend Ganpati Poojan at CJI D Y Chandrachud’s residence. The same suspects held it as an epitome of secularism when Dr Manmohan Singh hosted Iftar parties and then CJI would attend, he said in a post on X.""Their problem is not the civility and cordiality between the Prime Minister and the CJI, alone, but Ganesh Chaturthi. The Congress and the Communists have always had a problem with Hindu festivals and now they have a problem with Maharashtra also, which celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi with great fervour,"" he added.Union minister Bhupender Yadav said those who applaud the presence of Prime Ministers at Iftars but criticize Modi's participation in Ganesh Puja. He asserted that the executive and judiciary praying together before revered deities reflects the true strength of Indian secularism.""The same people who applaud and encourage presence of Prime Ministers at Iftars find their guts twisting and turning when they see PM Modi perform Ganpati Poojan at CJI DY Chandrachud’s residence,"" he said.""The executive and judiciary praying before Gods revered by crores of devotees across India reflects the real strength of Indian secularism. Deal with it,"" he added.Addressing the media at the BJP headquarters on Thursday, party national spokesperson Sambit Patra also reminded the opposition of the Iftar parties held during the UPA government's tenure.He recalled that during the UPA era, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used to host Iftar parties, which the Chief Justice of that time also attended.""Did they not meet then? Didn't they sit at the same table and talk? That was also a festival (Iftar party), and this was also a festival (Ganpati Puja). So why object now? Why is there discrimination between these two festivals?"" he questioned.Patra expressed surprise that when the Prime Minister meets the Chief Justice, there is an objection, but there is no objection when Rahul Gandhi meets Ilhan Omar, a known critic of India and a supporter of Pakistan.""What do these people want? Do they want the pillars of democracy not to meet? Does attending an Aarti change the equations?"" the BJP spokesperson questioned.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the residence of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud for Ganesh Puja.

NEW DELHI: India and China agreed to redouble their efforts and work with emergency to achieve complete disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh, which India sees as essential for normalising Sino-Indian ties , in a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on the margins of the BRICS NSAs meeting in St Petersburg.A Chinese readout, which didn’t specifically mention disengagement, said they discussed progress in border talks and agreed stability in ties is in long-term interests of both countries.The Doval-Wang meeting was the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic engagements in the past couple of months that focused on achieving a breakthrough in the ongoing negotiations to complete the disengagement process and end the military standoff that started in May 2020.Apart from two rounds of diplomatic talks in the past few months to address the remaining issues, external affairs minister S Jaishankar also twice met Wang in July on the margins of multilateral events to underscore the need to end the impasse and restore LAC peace and tranquillity.``The meeting gave the two sides an opportunity to review the recent efforts towards finding an early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC, which will create conditions to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations,’’ said the Indian government in a statement.Doval conveyed to Wang that peace and tranquillity in borders areas and respect for LAC are essential for normalcy in bilateral relations, underlining that both sides must fully abide by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached in the past by the 2 governments.Doval had met Wang on the sidelines of the BRICS NSAs meeting in Johannesburg last year too. Like last time, they agreed that the India-China bilateral relationship is significant not just for the two countries but also for the region and the world.Jaishankar and Wang in July had called for ``strong guidance’’ to end the standoff and, while a breakthrough has remained elusive, both sides have sounded positive about the negotiations. China said after the diplomatic talks last month that both sides had narrowed differences and agreed to reach a solution acceptable to both sides as soon as possibleBoth sides have intensified engagements for disengagement in remaining areas also because they realise any breakthrough can pave the way for a bilateral meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at the BRICS summit in Kazan in October. The leaders will come face to face for the first time in Kazan since their” informal’’ meeting at the same summit in Johannesburg last year. Modi had used the meeting to raise concerns about the unresolved border issues, while calling for expediting the disengagement and de-escalation process. That meeting though was mired in a controversy over who first proposed it. While China said Xi spoke to Modi on the latter’s request, India denied it saying it had only responded to a pending Chinese request for a bilateral meeting between the leaders.",NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met in St Petersburg.

NEW DELHI: Faced with a huge financial burden caused by the ruling of a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court enabling states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and to levy tax on mineral-bearing land, Centre has sought a review, pointing out several ""errors apparent in the judgment"".Interestingly, the Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment in an open court hearing and argued that the issue raised by it ""pertains to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country and raises larger issue of public interest and grave injustice would ensue if the application for oral hearing of the review petition is not allowed"".When senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi , appearing for some mineral-rich states, sought early listing of pending cases relating to dues before a regular bench to follow the nine-judge verdict and give the intended financial relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud about filing of the review petitions by the Centre and a Tata group entity.""Review of a Constitution bench judgement,"" exclaimed the CJI.Dwivedi said the review plea was indicative of the fact that PSUs, who have benefited immensely from extraction of minerals without paying royalty or tax on mineral-bearing land for decades, did not want to pay the minimum amount fixed by the apex court.After Centre and private companies requested the court to make the levies on minerals by states prospective, the nine-judge bench, with Justice B V Nagarathna dissenting, had clarified on Aug 14 that arrears of royalty and tax on mineral-bearing land would be paid in instalments to states from 2005 over the next 12 years. It was also clarified that arrears would not attract interest.The financial implication for public sector undertakings, without interest, has been estimated to be Rs 70,000 crore. This jumps to 1.5 lakh crore if the arrears due from 2005 to be realised from private sector industries are included. Mineral-rich states which will benefit majorly are Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.Pleading with SC for prospective implementation of its nine-judge bench ruling, Union govt had argued that retrospective application would create a burden humongous enough to ruin many PSUs and industries, dent the larger economy and send prices of almost every product soaring.","The Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment.

VHP and Bajrang Dal have announced a bandh in Nagamangala on Friday.Cops registered at least 10 FIRs and arrested 54 persons on charges of rioting , murder attempt, damage to public property, assault, preventing a policeman from discharging duties, and unlawful assembly in violence that broke out on Wednesday evening.""The situation is under control now. We have deployed enough force and taken all precautionary measures,"" Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said in Bengaluru on Thursday.Mandya SP Mallikarjun Baladandi said the police is investigating whether the violence was premeditated.Over 300 police personnel will continue to monitor Nagamangala, 45km from Mandya and 120km from Bengaluru, till the weekend.The violence started when a group allegedly hurled stones during the procession near a mosque on Mysuru Road. According to Baladandi, the altercation occurred when those taking part in the procession stopped near a dargah and started dancing. A dispute arose when another group demanded that the procession move ahead, leading to a standoff that was resolved by police.Later, the devotees' group involved in the procession protested in front of Nagamangala police station, accusing police of ""obstructing"" their procession. Police allowed the procession to continue, but two groups suddenly started throwing stones at each other. The situation turned worse when arsonists allegedly started targeting shops, 25 in all, and damaged eight motorcycles, two cars and as many autorickshaws.An SI sustained minor injuries, and the residence of former MLA and JDS leader Suresh Gowda was damaged in the incident.Meanwhile, police are facing allegations of negligence for allowing a procession to pass through a sensitive area, despite a previous clash, in 2023. Police's alleged failure to learn from past has come under scrutiny. A senior officer denied granting permission for the procession to go near the mosque. However, the participants in the procession took a U-turn near Mysuru Road and approached the mosque, leading to the subsequent events, sources said.","Violence broke out during a Ganesh idol-immersion procession in Nagamangala, Karnataka.

""There is a delay of 27 days in deciding the detenu's representation by the central govt and 20 days by the detaining authority,"" SC said and quashed the detention order on this ground.The man, A K Mohd Shaji , was put under preventive detention for a year from Sept 2, 2023, under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (Cofeposa) Act, 1974. Though the grounds of his arrest were communicated to him on Sept 6, 2023, his representation against detention was sent by prison authorities by post which never reached the central govt.Analysing the rights of detenues, the bench deprecated the conduct of Thiruvananthapuram jail administration and said, ""We find that the superintendent of the central prison and correctional home has acted in a thoroughly callous and casual manner. It is the duty of the transmitting authorities to send the representation of the detenue promptly. Though it is the corresponding duty of the detaining authority to consider the said representation and decide it swiftly, the same has been followed only in breach in the present matter.""Charging the jail authorities with failing in their duties, SC said, ""In the present era of technological advancement, jail authorities could have very well sent the copies of the representation to the detaining/appropriate authority either by email or at least a physical copy could have been sent by speed post (acknowledgement due) so there could have been some evidence of the said being sent to the competent authority and could have been tracked.""","The man, A K Mohd Shaji, was put under preventive detention for a year from Sept 2, 2023, under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (Cofeposa) Act, 1974.

Govt to develop Mausam GPT in 5 years to share weather information,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-develop-mausam-gpt-in-5-years-to-share-weather-info/articleshow/113306697.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to not only enhance rain but also suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will. This means, if Delhi or any other city wants to suppress rains during, say, Independence Day celebrations, scientists would be able to do it through interventions.Similarly, rain/hail can be suppressed in cities during floods.“We want to go for initial experimental artificial rain suppression and enhancement. Lab simulations (cloud chambers) will be done in the next 18 months, but we’ll definitely go for artificial weather modification in the five-year time scale,” said M Ravichandran, secretary, earth sciences ministry (MoES), on Thursday elaborating on Mission Mausam which got the Cabinet’s nod a day earlier.On whether rains could be suppressed on August 15, Ravichandran said: “We can think of it (through weather modification)”. Under the Mission Mausam mandate, scientists will also work on incremental improvement of weather forecast systems in the country in terms of further raising short- and medium-range forecast accuracy by 5-10%.Under the Mission, which aims to make India climate smart and weather-ready by not letting any weather phenomena, including even cloud burst, remain undetected, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) along with other scientific institutions of the MoES will also develop and launch ‘ Mausam GPT ’, a chatGPT like application, that will help users to get quick weather related information in both written and audio form in the next five years.Suppression and enhancement of rain techniques are already being used through cloud seeding, using aircraft, in a limited way in the US, Canada, China, Russia and Australia among others. There have beencloud seeding projects, called overseeding, aimed at reducing hail in order to prevent damage to fruit orchards and grain fields in a couple of these countries.“Cloud seeding and cloud modification is a complex process. We have done a lot of experiments with cloud seeding to enhance rain with limited success. But not much has been done on cloud suppression,” Madhavan Rajeevan, former MoES secretary, told TOI.He said though there is a scope in India for weather modification, its science is not well understood and technology is complex. “In my opinion, we should start doing research in weather modification and we need investments,” said Rajeevan.The government has initially approved Rs 2,000 crore over two years for the Mission Mausam to create a more ro bust forecasting system for dealing with the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change . Later, more funds will be earmarked for it.Critical elements of the mission include the deployment of next-generation radars and satellite systems with advanced sensors and high-performance supercomputers, the development of improved earth system models and a GIS-based automated Decision Support System for real-time data dissemination.India is already experimenting with artificial rain making techniques, involving cloud seeding using aircraft, and have done some pilot projects in Maharashtra and elsewhere. It is being done to study cloud microphysical characteristics through a research programme, called Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX).","Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to enhance rain and suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will.

His family donated his body to the hospital for research and training.Among the tributes was that of PM Modi, who noted Yechury's ""ability to connect across political spectrum "". CPM 's Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan spoke of his ""unmatched ideological commitment and strategic brilliance"".Yechury, CPM general secretary when he passed away, rose through the ranks, starting as a student activist in JNU. A 1977 photo of him reading a students' resolution to Indira Gandhi , demanding she quit as JNU chancellor, has gained iconic status, partly since Mrs Gandhi did resign. Decades later, Yechury was to closely interact with Sonia Gandhi , as one of the pivotal CPM politicians during UPA-1. That the communist party decided to help Congress form a coalition govt after the 2004 general elections, was thanks in no small measure to Yechury's pragmatism.His thesis that alliance with Congress, for years called the principal class enemy by CPM hardliners, was necessary to take on BJP, has proved durable. CPM is part of the INDIA bloc .Yechury, born in Chennai to a Telugu Brahmin family, was, in his words, the family's ""first communist"". He was also probably the most articulate of all CPM leaders, a quality that made him the best-known communist in Delhi's political and media circles.","Yechury was admitted with pneumonia.

"IAF wants Tejas jet production to be ramped up, even as supply of delayed US engines to begin from Nov",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-wants-tejas-jet-production-to-be-ramped-up-even-as-supply-of-delayed-us-engines-to-begin-from-nov/articleshow/113301206.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle China and Pakistan, the IAF has called for majorly ramping up the production rate of indigenous Tejas fighter jets , even using the public-private partnership route.The good news is that US company General Electric is now likely to begin from Nov onwards the much-delayed supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines, which power Tejas Mark-1A fighters, after defence minister Rajnath Singh flagged the matter during his visit to Washington last month.IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years, which will require defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ) to step-up its production rate in a major way.“The issue is matching production capacity with our requirements. The way forward is to diversify production lines, have more public private partnerships or joint ventures with private partners to have multiple weaponry lines as well as multiple production lines,” IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari said, on the sidelines of the multi-nation Tarang Shakti exercise in Jodhpur.On the supply of aero-engines, HAL is slated to get delivery of at least two GE-F404 engines per month from Nov onwards, as per the fresh commitment given by General Electric, officials told TOI.“The assurance is there. But whether the delivery of the aero-engines actually begins in Nov remains to be seen,” an official said. The delay in the delivery timeframe of 99 GE-F404 aero-engines, which were to begin in March, is one of the major problems that has hit the production schedule of the first 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets, which were contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal inked in Feb 2021, as was reported by TOI earlier.All these 83 “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jets were to be delivered to IAF in the February 2024-February 2028 timeframe. “Under the contract, the first jet was to be delivered by Feb-March this year, but it will probably come only by Nov now. At best, HAL will be able to deliver only eight of 16 jets that were to be delivered in the 2024-25 fiscal. All this will have a cascading effect down the line,” the official said.Another Rs 67,000 crore contract for 97 more Tejas Mark-1A fighters is also now being finalized, with the defence ministry issuing the tender to HAL earlier this year.India and the US, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and HAL for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The cabinet committee on security in August 2022 had cleared the over Rs 9,000 crore development of the Tejas Mark-2 fighters with the more powerful GE-F414 engines. IAF plans to induct six squadrons (108 jets) of Tejas Mark-2, which will have a longer combat range and greater weapon-carrying capacity than the Mark-1A variant.Under the long developmental saga of the Tejas, IAF till now has only got 35-36 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters that were ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in March 2006 and Dec 2010.","IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years.
