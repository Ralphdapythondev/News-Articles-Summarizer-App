People who should be getting bail in the high courts will not necessarily get it, as a result of which they have to move to SC.This delay compounds the problem of those who are facing arbitrary arrests ,"" he said.Speaking at the 11th annual conference of Berkeley Centre for Comparative Equality and Anti-Discrimination Law, hosted by National Law School of India University (NLSIU) at Bangalore International Centre, Justice Chandrachud stressed the need for judges to employ ""a robust common sense "" and urged the public to trust decision-makers.He stressed the importance of trusting lower-level courts within the hierarchical legal system. ""We have to encourage trial courts to be more receptive to the need for accommodating concerns of people who are seeking liberty,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the problem today is that we look at any grant of relief by trial judges with a degree of suspicion. That means the trial judges are increasingly playing it safe, not granting bail on important issues of serious crimes.""Using a narcotics case as an example, the CJI illustrated how understanding the role of the accused - whether a cleaner, driver, or owner - is crucial for fair judgment.""When you have an accused in a narcotics case, you look at the finer points of case: What was he doing? Was he a cleaner in the truck? Was he a driver in the truck? Was he the owner of the truck? Was he the person who was really the main person behind the trade which is taking place? Unless we, therefore, separate grain from the chaff in criminal jurisprudence, it's very unlikely that we'll have just solutions.""His comments came in response to a participant's question about living in a society where authorities act first and seek forgiveness later, often detaining activists, academics, journalists, and politicians in politically motivated actions.",CJI DY Chandrachud called for trial judges to fulfil their duties without fear of distrust.

Recently two couples had been caught on video while getting intimate on a bike and in a moving car. The cops had taken action in both cases, and booked those involved.In Saturday’s incident, sources said the couple, who stays in the vicinity, are under medical treatment for some psychological issues . It’s learnt the man, who worked as a security guard , has a habit of stepping out of the house without clothes after consuming liquor. On Saturday night, when the man stepped out without his clothes, he was followed by wife too.The sight of a naked couple shocked passers-by. Many also assumed the couple had walked out without clothes in a fit of rage. Many viewers also assumed they had stepped out of a car parked nearby. In reality, the owner of the car had gone for tea when the drama unfurled on the road.Some onlookers objected to the couple’s shocking behaviour, and one of them even thrashed the man, who hit him back, and hurled stones. A lot of this was captured on cellphone cameras and shared on social media. On Sunday, videos of the couple went viral, and the cops stepped into the picture.Senior inspector of Bajaj Nagar police station Vithal Rajput said the couple was identified on Sunday morning but action was not initiated as they seemed to be mentally challenged, which was also verified. “We summoned the couple and their family members, who were adequately counselled against such uncontrolled behaviour in public places ,” said Rajput. He added the cops did not act since the couple was driven by mental health issues.Sources said the cops had visited the spot immediately after being informed post midnight, but could not find anyone then. They zeroed down on the couple on Sunday morning after getting some information about their whereabouts.","Naked couple on the road at Bajaj Nagar left passers-by shocked.

Demolition underway at Seven Sea waterpark and resort where Milind More died.

MUMBAI: Milind More (47), the son of former Thane district undivided Shiv Sena President Raghunath More , passed away suddenly on Sunday after a violent altercation between two groups at a resort in Virar. The incident occurred when an auto rickshaw hit one of their family members. Milind and his family were heading home after enjoying a picnic at the time.Although the exact cause of death remains unknown, family members reported that a group of men struck the victim on his chest, possibly triggering a cardiac arrest. Raghunath had taken over as Thane district president following the passing of Anand Dighe in August 2001.The Arnala police have filed a case against the accused men, charging them with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, rash driving, and rioting. No arrests have been made thus far. The incident took place around 5.30 pm when Milind and his family of over 15 members were preparing to leave the Seven Sea Waterpark and Beach Resort in Navapur for their home in Thane. As the auto rickshaw driver was reversing, he accidentally hit Milind's nephew, trapping the nephew's leg under the rear wheel. In response, Milind slapped the driver, which prompted a group of 8 to 10 men from the resort to begin assaulting Milind, allegedly punching him repeatedly. The resort's closed circuit television captured the incident on video.According to the family's statements to the police, the mob targeted Milind's chest and abdomen during the assault, potentially causing him to suffer a heart attack. Milind was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but unfortunately, he was pronounced dead upon arrival. The police have stated that the autopsy report will help determine the cause of death.Vasai Virar municipal corporation carried out demolition of illegal resorts in Arnala area, following the death of Milind More.The civic administration said that the demolition was carried out in compliance with the directives issued by chief minister Eknath Shinde.","Milind More (47) passed away suddenly on Sunday after a violent altercation between two groups at a resort in Virar.

Rahul Gandhi , in his second speech as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear and alleged that power was centred around only 6 people.The Congress leader then referred to Lord Shiva's wedding procession ""Shiva ki baraat"" to claim that opposition bloc INDIA was open to all.""Thousands of years ago, in Kurukshetra, six people trapped Abhimanyu in a 'Chakravyuh' and killed him. I did a little research and found out that 'Chakravyuha' is also known as 'Padmavuyh' - which means 'Lotus formation'. Chakravyuh ' is in the shape of a Lotus. In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus. The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest. What was done with Abhimanyu, is being down with India - the youth, farmers, women, small and medium businesses. Abhimanyu was killed by six people. Today, too there are six people in the centre of 'Chakravyuha',"" Rahul alleged.""The 'chakravyuha' that has captured India has three forces behind it: first is the idea of monopoly capital-- that two people should be allowed to own the entire Indian wealth ... The second element is the institutions, agencies, CBI, ED, Income Tax department of this nation; and the third is the political executive. These three together are at the heart of the 'chakravyuh', and they have devastated this country,"" he added.""'Chakravyuha' cannot defeat 'Shiva's baraat'. You call yourself Hindu, you do not understand Hinduism. You create 'chakravyuhas' and we break them,"" Rahul said attacking the BJP.Now, let's cut back to Rahul's first speech as leader of opposition earlier this month during the debate on Motion of Thanks to President's address. The speech then centred around Lord Shiva and also made mention of several other religions to drive home the point that all of them preach one thing ""Daro mat, Darao mat (Don't be scare and don't scare).The Congress leader himself made a mention of his last speech in today's address.""In the last speech, I spoke about some religious concepts. Shivji's concept and concept of Ahinsa is that the trishool is placed behind the back and is not held in the hand. I spoke about the snake on Shivji's neck and I also said how all religions in our country proposed the idea of non-violence, which can be capsulated in the phrase Daro mat Darao mat. I also said that there is an idea beyond the personal. The idea of the Abhay Mudra is that transmits this motion of Ahinsa and affection and fearlessness to everybody else,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader had then also held up a picture of Lord Shiva and said his message is about fearlessness and non-violence. He continued showing posters of Gods despite Speaker Om Birla's repeated requests not to do so.Rahul targeted the BJP and said those who call themselves Hindus are engaged in ""violence and hate"" round the clock. ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus)"" he had said leading to a huge uproar in the House.His remarks evoked immediate reaction from Prime Minister Modi who said that calling the entire Hindu society violent is a serious matter.However, an aggressive Rahul did not budge and asserted that Prime Minister Modi, the BJP or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were not the entire Hindu society.","Rahul Gandhi invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear.

The Mughals' ability to maintain composure despite donning bulky traditional attire and carrying out household chores is something that is rarely discussed, except from their breathtakingly beautiful palaces, graceful dance as depicted in movies, or heartfelt hymns chanted in Allah's honour. But how did the Mughals survive without air conditioning? How did they build cooling architecture? That is the question.In the 21st century.It's as if we continually shatter our own records of hottest days alive. July 22 was the hottest day with the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A deadly heat wave across the world and malfunctioning air conditioners claimed many people's lives for a while.Air conditioning in buildings indicates considerable energy use and utility expenditures. Today, while we are developing sustainable heating and cooling technologies to comply with the green construction movement, it is important to note that ecological heating and cooling techniques have been employed for as long as humans have been building homes. Mughal architecture in India provides unique active and passive air conditioning technologies that can be easily incorporated into contemporary buildings.The Mughals employed two elements to regulate the weather around the structure: flora and water. These waterways and fountains were frequently extended into the interiors of structures. The Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes.Through evaporation, these water elements not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also helped to cool the air. The pools' reflecting surfaces also assisted in deflecting sunlight from the structures, which lessened their ability to absorb heat.One common element of Mughal design was jharokhas, or overhanging enclosed balconies. These buildings promoted natural ventilation in addition to their aesthetic appeal. Jharokhas were positioned strategically to allow air to move throughout the building, limiting direct sunlight and offering shade while also facilitating a steady supply of fresh air.Huge courtyards and verdant gardens were frequently incorporated into the architectural designs of Mughal structures. The environment was significantly cooled by these open areas. Cooler air might flow within the buildings and hot air could exit through the courtyards. Gardens, which frequently have pools and other water elements, produced a microclimate that considerably lowered the temperature.The Mughals also employed inventive cooling methods like terraces and roof gardens. By acting as insulation, these raised gardens assisted in lowering the amount of heat that the roofs absorbed. Through transpiration, the flora on the roof gardens had a cooling effect that improved the comfort of the interior spaces below.Buildings with thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies. As insulators, the thick walls limited the amount of heat that could enter from the outside, keeping the interiors cold. The living areas below were significantly cooler due to the hot air rising to the high ceilings. This type of architecture was especially common in palaces and huge public structures.Large domes and chhatris, or elevated dome-shaped pavilions, were useful features in Mughal design in addition to being decorative. These buildings promoted air movement and offered shade. Because of their high ceilings, the domes assisted in keeping the lower rooms cooler by retaining hot air and letting it to leave through ventilation at the top.Mughal architecture was distinguished by its finely carved jaali screens. Similar to contemporary blinds, these perforated stone screens allowed air to travel through while obstructing direct sunlight, producing a cooling effect. The jaali screens made sure the interiors stayed pleasant even on the warmest days by dispersing sunlight and lowering heat buildup.Mughal buildings were orientated with great care to maximise shade and reduce heat gain. Structures were frequently orientated to benefit from the dominant winds, which improved natural ventilation. Living areas were kept cool and shaded by the use of covered pathways and verandas.","Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element.

The Congress did not even implement Mandal Commission recommendations, made in 1983. Finally, it was a BJP supported Govt that implemented it in 1990. Rajiv Gandhi vehemently opposed OBC quota in 1990,"" Malviya said in a post on X.""Under Sonia Gandhi (between 2004-10), the Congress tried to defraud the OBCs in Andhra Pradesh by giving away a chunk of their quota to Muslims. They even tried to include Muslims under the central OBC quota in 2011, which would have reduced the OBC share in central institutions and jobs.

A chakravyuha has violence and fear.

But I think it is for the two of us to talk it over and to find a way.""""Obviously other countries in the world would have an interest in the matter, because we are two big countries and the state of our relationship has an impact on the rest of the world.But we are not looking to other countries to sort out what is really an issue between us,"" he added while reponding to a question on Quad members's reaction on India-China issue.The minister also said that he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi twice this month and had talked about the issue.

Heat & height deadly mix for plane engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-height-deadly-mix-for-plane-engines/articleshow/112118917.cms,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: An IIT prof, who was one of the passengers whose flight was cancelled at Leh airport on Sunday, said such high temperatures at a place like Ladakh was a sign of climate change .""It was unimaginable for me that at an altitude of 11,000 ft in Leh, where temperatures routinely drop to minus 20 degrees C, I would become a victim of global warming ,"" said the professor, Chetan Solanki.""The surprise was not the flight cancellation but the reason for which it was cancelled - high temperatures. No one will be spared the impact of climate change. Today, I have become a victim. Everyone should know their turn and their children's turn will come.''The IIT Bombay professor who is on unpaid leave from work left his Mumbai home in 2020 on an 11-year 'Energy Swaraj Yatra' to create awareness about climate change and encourage climate correctives. Last week, he was in Ladakh to attend the Sun and Earth festival which promotes eco-friendly practices. Solanki reached Leh airport for the 1pm IndiGo flight to Delhi only to hear the airline announce that the flight had been cancelled due to high temperatures.In a statement, IndiGo said its ""flight operations to and from Leh have been impacted due to the prevailing high outside air temperature in Leh, which is beyond the airline's control"".How does high temperature affect airline flights? Air density decreases with increase in altitude, which is why mountaineers rely on oxygen cylinders at heights above 14,000 feet. The Leh airport is at an elevation of about 10,700 feet, where the air is much thinner than, say at the Delhi airport, which is at about 770 feet. Another factor that decreases air density is temperature - higher the temperature, lower would be the density. A combination of these two factors spells trouble for aircraft.Low air density degrades engine performance. The A320s and B737 jet engines take longer to rev up and reach lift-off speed, thus consuming a longer length of runway during take-off. Thin air also affects aircraft performance post take-off during the climb phase and then again, when landing as the aircraft needs a comparatively higher approach speed to generate enough lift to stay afloat. Said an airline commander, requesting anonymity: ""High temperature forces weight restrictions on aircraft. Last week, we had the air traffic controller report a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, which is too high for Leh operations.""High temperatures at that altitude means aircraft engines cannot develop the thrust required to take off with commercially viable load. Heat and height are a deadly cocktail for engines. Delhi Airport, on the other hand, sees wide body aircraft take off for long hauls even at 45-47 degrees Celsius as IGIA is only 770 feet above mean sea level, pilots explained.Senior commander Capt Amit Singh said: ""Temperatures above 36 degrees C at the Leh airport is akin to taking off from a runway that's at an altitude of 16,000 feet, which makes the aircraft incapable of taking off safely.""When airlines realise that Leh temperature could cross 32-33 degrees Celsius at the scheduled time of departure, they cancel the flights - meaning do not send the aircraft to Leh or divert it to some other place if already enroute. The reason: after landing, the aircraft would get stuck there till the next morning and not be able to do all the other routes it had to. Or it would have to fly back with hardly any passengers and their baggage. Leh anyway sees flight operations till around 1pm as later tailwinds get too strong to permit aircraft movement.IndiGo in its statement added that it has offered the affected passengers alternatives, refunds and that passengers should check the flight status before leaving for the airport. Three other carriers TOI contacted did not respond.","Chetan Solanki is on an 11-year 'Energy Swaraj Yatra' to create awareness about climate change.

Interim relief refused."" It posted Bihar govt's appeal for detailed hearing to Sept.Bihar govt attempted to differentiate its case from Maharashtra, whose law granting quota to Marathas that took the total quota beyond the 50% limit was quashed by a five-judge constitution bench of SC in May 2021 in Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil case.Divan argued the Maharashtra law was quashed as the state did not satisfy the pre-condition set in the Indra Sawhney judgment - collection of socio-economic data to prove backwardness among more classes of citizens making it essential to grant quota over and above 50%.He also contended that SC on May 1, 2023 in Yogesh Kumar Thakur case had stayed a judgment of Chhattisgarh high court, which had stopped recruitment following hike in quota from 50% to 65%, but had allowed the recruitments to go on as the advertisements were issued prior to the high court judgment. It had also clarified that all these recruitments would be subject to the outcome of judicial scrutiny of the validity of enhanced quota.Bihar said it had carried out a caste survey in 2022-23. ""Despite decades of affirmative actions and schemes, less than 18% of govt employees come from communities that constitute 85% of the population. The high court 's conclusion is flawed, being reductive and divorced from reality,"" it said.""The caste survey reveals that backward classes in Bihar are trailing in most socio-economic markers. Therefore, there was a dire need to provide additional support and representation to these communities,"" it added.","Supreme Court rejects Bihar govt's plea for revival of laws increasing quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs to 65% from 50% in state govt jobs and admissions to state-run educational institutions.

""Existing system of seven technology clusters, each headed by a DG, is not working optimally,"" an official said.There is also the proposal to set up a new department of defence science , technology and innovation (DDSTI) to replace the existing department of defence R&D, with bifurcation of the secretary DDR&D-cum-DRDO chairman post.DRDO, which has an outlay of Rs 23,855 crore in the 2024-25 Union Budget, has faced scathing criticism for huge cost and time overruns in developing advanced weapon systems over the years. It has even been seeking repeated extensions for ""mission mode projects (MMPs)"", which are high priority programmes based on specific operational military requirements that must be completed within definite timeframes.The defence ministry told Parliament last year that 23 of the 55 MMPs of DRDO, which involve technologies that are already available and readily accessible in India or abroad, had been delayed.""In this era of advanced unmanned combat, AI, hypersonic weapons, cyber and space warfare, India requires a 'a whole of nation' approach, with DRDO, academia, private sector and the armed forces all coming together,"" a top official said.""India needs to build a strong national ecosystem with the capability to design, develop and manufacture advanced weapon systems. No country will give you cutting-edge technologies,"" he added.","The much-needed structural and functional revamp of DRDO proposed by a high- powered expert committee is now on course. The Union government also set to soon take a final call on the implementation of some ""contentious"" recommendations. The reforms are part of the overall policy to build a strong defence R&D ecosystem and industrial base.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112118026,imgsize-855054,width-400,resizemode-4/112118026.jpg"
Quad bats for peace in Gaza and Ukraine; EAM says more contact likely with Ukraine and Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-bats-for-peace-in-gaza-and-ukraine-eam-says-more-contact-likely-with-ukraine-and-russia/articleshow/112117966.cms,"Amid heightened Israel-Hezbollah tensions, leading to fears of a wider regional conflict in West Asia, Quad turned its gaze to the situation in Gaza calling for parties concerned to work for release of all hostages and immediate ceasefire. In their joint statement, they twice underscored the need to prevent escalation and spilling over of the conflict in the region.India Monday issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in Lebanon to exercise caution after Israel threatened action against Hezbollah for a Golan Heights attack that left 12 children dead.While discussing global and regional issues, the Quad meeting also focused on the war in Ukraine and terrorism , naming Pakistan based terror groups like LeT and JeM and seeking action without delay against the perpetrators of Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.On Ukraine, for the second time in 2 years the ministers expressed their deepest concern over the “tragic and terrible” humanitarian consequences of the war as they called upon all states to not use force against sovereignty, territorial integrity and “political independence” of any state.At a media event later in the day, Jaishankar defended India’s position on the war saying India believes there won’t be a “decisive outcome” from the battlefield and it’s important for countries in touch with both parties to remain active and do whatever they can to move the action from the battlefield to the conference table. While he didn’t confirm whether PM Narendra Modi will visit Ukraine in August, Jaishankar said he “reasonably” expected more Indian contact with both Ukraine and Russia.There was substantial focus in the joint statement on West Asia as the ministers said they shared great interest in achieving peace and stability in the region, and called for an end to any action that could undermine the prospects of a 2-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and violent extremism on all sides.According to the joint statement, the ministers reiterated commitment to a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state “taking into account Israel’s legitimate security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace”.They also unequivocally condemned the terror attacks on October 7, 2023, by Hamas, while describing as unacceptable the large-scale loss of civilian lives and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.“We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza,” said the joint statement, stressing the need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and to comply with international humanitarian law. The ministers urged countries in the Indo-Pacific too to increase their efforts to address the “dire humanitarian need on the ground”.Quad also condemned ongoing attacks by the Houthis against commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. “These attacks destabilize the region, impede navigational rights and freedoms, and trade flows, and jeopardize the safety of vessels and people on board including sailors,” said the ministers.",Quad calls for parties concerned to work for release of all hostages and immediate ceasefire.

"Quad raps China for SCS manoeuvres, backs Philippines",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-raps-china-for-scs-manoeuvres-backs-philippines/articleshow/112117977.cms,"China expectedly loomed over the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo Monday as India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s “dangerous manoeuvres” in the South China Sea ( SCS ) and called for an Indo-Pacific in which no country dominates and no country is dominated.In a first, India also joined others in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone and.India had for the first time last year, in a joint statement with the Philippines, unambiguously asked China to adhere to the legally binding tribunal award Beijing has always called null and void. Before that India had restricted itself to only calling for respecting the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal was instituted.As they reassembled in Tokyo after the recent China-Philippines tensions, the ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and for this purpose, to enhance collaboration with regional partners. They also announced initiatives to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training and capacity building. “In line with such efforts, we intend to geographically expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to the Indian Ocean region,” said the joint statement.The ministers also committed to soon having the 2024 Quad summit which PM Narendra Modi is now looking to host on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September, pending the availability of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. Japan is yet to confirm because the date for ruling LDP election might clash with the General Assembly session, making it difficult for him to travel abroad.In his opening remarks, while talking about the need for Quad to uphold a rules-based order, Jaishankar said it’s only Quad collaboration that can ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free, remains open, stable, secure and prosperous.“It is therefore essential that our political understanding strengthens, our economic partnerships grow, our technology collaborations expand and our people-to-people comfort intensifies. Our meeting should send a clear message, that the Quad is here to stay, here to do and here to go,” he addedIn their pushback against China, the Quad ministers backed sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also expressing commitment to address debt crises through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. They expressed serious concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas, reiterating their strong opposition to any unilateral action to change the status quo by force or coercion.“We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea. We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” said the joint statement.According to the ministers, Quad is also looking to contribute to the region through capacity building cooperation for enhancing maritime security. “We intend to launch a Quad Maritime Legal Dialogue under the Quad Maritime Security Working Group to focus our expertise on international law of the sea issues in support of our efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific,” said the statement.","India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s ‘dangerous manoeuvres’ in the South China Sea ( SCS ) The ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112117994,imgsize-1556167,width-400,resizemode-4/112117994.jpg"

He later found himself admonished by Birla, who said ""you are leader of the opposition. I expect you to first read all the rules of procedure at least one more time"".In a terse comment, Rahul said the opposition has ""shattered the confidence of PM Modi"" who is not able to come for his speeches, and that Modi would never come for his speeches in future.There was laughter when the Chair stopped Rahul from naming Adani and Ambani, with Birla reminding that Congress's Gaurav Gogoi has himself argued in writing that non-members should not be named in the House. At this, Rahul asked if he could call them ""A1 and A2"". He also asked if he could call them ""3 and 4"", referring to his list of six people who he argued were running the ""chakravyuh"".The barbs did not go down well. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju got up to speak but Rahul refused to yield. When the minister insisted, Rahul said if the PM and ministers commit to yield in future when the opposition asks, then every opposition MP would reciprocate.Rijiju slammed Rahul for having disturbed the complete speech of PM in the last session, referring to Modi's reply to the ""motion of thanks"". ""You don't know the rules. Rahul has lowered the dignity of the House by challenging the Speaker,"" he said.But the LOP got back by saying that the minister has ""orders from the top"" to defend ""A1/A2"" and can do that in a democracy.
