"Centre nods for UPS, assures 50% of basic pay as pension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-nods-for-ups-assures-50-of-basic-pay-as-pension/articleshow/112770370.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bringing significant benefits to 23 lakh central govt employees , the central government on Saturday announced an overhaul of the 20-year-old National Pension System , including a higher contribution by govt for a guaranteed payout of 50% of the average basic pay drawn during the last 12 months of service.With the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), the govt sought to bring the benefits on a par with the old pension scheme (OPS) and blunt the opposition's bid to revert to the earlier regime in the states governed by them, and mop up electoral dividends in the ensuing assembly polls.The decision also opens the doors for states to offer UPS, a contributory scheme, which will take the count of beneficiaries to 90 lakh employees. The scheme - which employees will get a one-time option to switch to - introduces inflation adjustment through dearness relief.Those opting for UPS will be assured of 50% payout if they complete 25 years of service, information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced. The payout proportion will be lower for those who put in fewer years in any govt job. Cabinet secretary-designate TV Somanathan, who chaired the committee that reviewed NPS, told reporters that following the announcements, govt's contribution towards UPS will rise to 18.5%, against 14% currently.On their part, employees are required to chip in with a contribution of 10% of their basic pay and DA. Cabinet secretary-designate T V Somanathan said that there will be an actuarial calculation every three years to ensure that the liability does not remain unfunded, as was the case with OPS where govt had to bear the entire liability without the employee contributing anything.Elaborating on the ""five pillars"" of UPS, which will be implemented from April next year, Vaishnaw said a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 will be offered to those who work for 10 years, with family pension to the spouse pegged at 60% of the deceased govt employee's pension.In addition, a lump sum payment at time of retirement - 10% of the pay and dearness allowance (DA) for every six months of service - is also provided for. ""For 30 years of service, around six months of emoluments will be given as a lump sum amount at the time of retirement,"" the minister said, adding that the payment will be in addition to gratuity.The scheme, which will be extended to those who have retired, will result in an additional cost of Rs 6,250 crore due to higher contribution and another Rs 800 crore towards payment of arrears, Somanathan said. ""It is fiscally prudent... It is a funded, contributory scheme. The only difference in the changes made today is to give an assurance to govt employees and not leave it to market forces,"" he added.UPS - which was under review for 18 months - has sought to address key concerns of employees, especially the risk of lower payout due to market fluctuations as the over Rs 11 lakh crore pension corpus of govt employees who joined after 2004 is invested in govt securities (up to 65%), equities (15%) and corporate bonds.""Govt is ensuring that there is adequate money to pay pension, which was not the case under OPS. This is yet another fiscally prudent move, which also takes care of employees' interest,"" said Balram Bhagat, CEO and whole-time director, UTI Pension Fund, among the largest fund managers.At the press conference, Vaishnaw hit out at the opposition. ""Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have announced OPS but have not implemented it. Congress has merely announced and kept them under illusion. In contrast, PM Modi has implemented a scheme after extensive consultations, which also ensures inter-generational equity,"" he said.Though the scheme comes days after govt took back its plan to induct 45 mid-level officers through the lateral entry route amid criticism for not providing quotas to SCs and STs, Vaishnaw dismissed suggestions that it was politically motivated and could have helped BJP if it was announced ahead of the general elections. ""PM has always gone beyond electoral politics. Decisions are taken in public interest. It is a well thought out decision after extensive consultations. It has got nothing to do with elections. Govt employees, whether central govt or state govt, have seen the work over the last 10 years and we have received a lot of support from them,"" the minister said.","The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) will bring significant benefits to 23 lakh central govt employees.

"Pakistan invites Modi for SCO meet, PM likely to skip",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-invites-pm-modi-for-sco-chg-meet-hes-likely-to-skip/articleshow/112770161.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has invited PM Narendra Modi along with other Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) leaders for the Council of Heads of Government (CHG) in-person meeting it will host in October this year. While there is no question of Modi travelling to Islamabad, it will be of interest to see if he deputes a minister to represent India at the event, as he has done in the past, given the troubled relationship with Pakistan.Pakistan will host the meeting on October 15-16 as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG, the second highest decision-making body in the Eurasian group after the Council of Heads of State.Modi has been a regular at the heads of state summit, although he skipped the same in Kazakhstan this year apparently because it clashed with the Parliament session in early July.In the CHG, the practice has been to nominate a minister to represent India. Foreign minister S Jaishankar participated last year in the CHG meeting in Bishkek. It’s not clear yet if the leaders will be allowed to address the event in Pakistan virtually, if they are unable to participate physically. Both India and Pakistan are full members of the Russia and China-led group which New Delhi sees as crucial for regional security and cooperation with Central Asian countries.However, it remains wary of Chinese dominance in SCO and efforts to position the group as an anti-West platform. Unlike all other member-states, India has never endorsed China’s BRI in SCO joint statements and last year, at the heads of state summit Modi hosted virtually, it refused to join a long-term economic strategy that the bloc announced because it seemed designed to cater to Chinese interests.Significantly though, SCO is perhaps the only multilateral forum where India and Pakistan have managed to work together, despite the hostilities that have plagued the relationship since their abortive attempt to relaunch the dialogue process in 2015 and the terror attacks that followed. While Indian delegations have travelled to Pakistan for participation in SCO exercises and vice versa, Pakistan’s then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India last year for a meeting of SCO foreign ministers. This cooperation has been made possible by the SCO Charter that doesn’t allow member-states to raise bilateral issues.The Indian government is yet to take a decision on the invite, which was extended as per SCO protocol, for the CHG meeting. The recent terror attacks in Jammu will likely act as a deterrent against any high-profile minister-level visit to Pakistan. In his Kargil Vijay Diwas message last month, Modi had named Pakistan to say it had not learnt anything from history and was trying to remain relevant through terrorism and proxy war. The last Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan was Sushma Swaraj in 2015.Despite Modi’s rapport with his counterpart Shehbaz Sharif’s brother Nawaz Sharif, chances of a rapprochement in India-Pakistan relations remain slim. While Pakistan wants India to reverse the decision to abrogate J&K’s special status, India maintains that there’s nothing left to discuss with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue except its illegal occupation of PoK.","Pakistan will host the meeting on October 15-16 as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG.

NEW DELHI: After offering top-ups through assured 50% of salary as pension and inflation adjustment, the Bhartiya Janata Party is expecting political gains from govt employees, a section of which was swayed by Congress ' promise for a return to unfunded old pension scheme (OPS).Government cadres, especially in Delhi that goes to polls in February, have been a vote bank for BJP But in recent state elections , the demand for restoration of the OPS was used as a political stick to beat BJP. It was seen to have worked for Congress in Himachal Pradesh , where govt employees have traditionally wielded disproportionate influence.The party, however, escaped any damage in Madhya Pradesh as it comprehensively won both Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state.Although it was less of an issue in the Lok Sabha polls, the unhappiness of a section of vocal govt employees was palpable. Many observers speculated that it could be a factor in upcoming poll battles.Nearly 18 months in the making, the decision to implement the Unified Pension Scheme ( UPS ) has come ahead of assembly polls in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, dates for which have been announced. Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand are also due this year.Although Congress had vigorously advocated OPS in assembly polls, it was silent on OPS after the electoral setback in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and did not even mention it in the LS poll manifesto.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, while elaborating upon the Cabinet decision on the scheme, referred to how Congress made it a big poll issue in Himachal and Rajasthan, but OPS was never implemented by the party in the states, making it ""an illusion"".""Congress has always been insensitive towards employees, which is reflected in Himachal and Rajasthan. The party made promises in both the states but failed to implement the OPS... their politics of creating illusions was once again exposed,"" Vaishnaw said.He further said that the UPS, on the other hand, was a well thought through scheme under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi as it is fully funded by the state and promises intergenerational equality. ""Besides, funds will be provided based on the current requirement, leaving nothing for future, unlike what Congress did in Himachal and Rajasthan,"" the minister said, while dismissing suggestions that it was a political call.","Bhartiya Janata Party expecting political gains from govt employees.

"61% Lok Sabha MPs possess assets of Rs 5 crore and above, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/61-lok-sabha-mps-possess-assets-of-rs-5-crore-and-above-says-report/articleshow/112770044.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new report highlights that nearly 61% of 543 MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more and nearly 32% of members have a dynastic background , indicating entrenched familial ties in politics. Of these dynasts, 20.9% are first-generation, 72.1% are second-generation, and 6.4% are multi-generational politicians.This report titled “Who Enters The Parliament?” by a non-profit organisation ‘Prajatantra’ analyzes the composition of the 18th Lok Sabha, focusing on how MPs enter politics and the barriers they face.It also examines gatekeeping practices and representation of women.The data analysis shows that in the non-privileged methods of entry, party organizational politics (16.2%) is the most prominent method, followed by local politics (14.4%) and student politics (9.2%). While in the BJP, the most prominent method of non-privileged entry is local politics (16.8%), whereas in INC, it is through party organizational politics(12.1%).According to the report, in the 18th Lok Sabha elections, for instance, the BJP fielded 110 (24.8%) candidates with dynastic backgrounds, of which 62 successfully won seats, resulting in a strike rate of approximately 56.36%. Meanwhile, the Congress fielded 99 (30.3%) candidates from dynastic backgrounds, with 43 securing seats, yielding a strike rate of approximately 43.43%.Overall it comes through that money is the predominant barrier to entry as the data shows that nearly 61% of MPs possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more. This is followed by MPs from dynastic backgrounds, who make up 32%, and MPs with declared serious criminal cases, who make up 31%. Only 8.1% of the newly elected MPs successfully overcame all three barriers to entry.Party organizational politics is the most chosen path of entry for self-made politicians, with 25.2% coming from this pathway, followed by local politics at 20.7% and student politics at 14.4%.In a separate section in the report on women MPs it highlighted that 797 women contested the elections but only 74 were elected to Parliament. Among these MPs, 63.5% come from a family legacy or dynastic background, 14.9% emerged from local politics and 8.1% had celebrity status.Data also shows that out of the 74 MPs 63.5% have assets worth Rs 5 crore or more and 18.9% had declared serious criminal cases against them.“The analysis of the 18th Lok Sabha reveals a starkly limited presence of self-made politicians in parliament, with only a fraction overcoming significant entry barriers. Despite some MPs entering through non-privileged paths like local and student politics, these avenues remain predominantly gatekept by crorepatis and individuals with criminal antecedents—evidenced by over 90% of MPs being crorepatis,” the report concludes.","Nearly 61% of 543 MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha possess assets valued at Rs 5 crores or more.

Tamil Nadu-based space startup launches India’s first reusable hybrid rocket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-based-space-startup-launches-indias-first-reusable-hybrid-rocket/articleshow/112769989.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: A day after the country celebrated the first National Space Day, Tamil Nadu-based startup Space Zone India launched India’s first reusable hybrid rocket , Mission RHUMI-2024, on board a mobile platform from the TTDC Ground in Thiruvidandhai, East Coast Road, Chennai on Saturday. RHUMI-1 rocket launched three Cube satellites and 50 PICO satellites to a suborbital trajectory and the aim of these satellites is to collect data for research purposes on global warming and climate change.Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is the only company in the world that has the technology to reuse the same rocket for multiple launches. Space Zone India attempted to emulate the same technology but on a small scale. The company has built an innovative, cost-effective, and eco-friendly descent mechanism that will ensure the safe recovery of rocket components. Reusability enables space companies to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket. This, in turn, will lower the cost of launches.Equipped with a generic-fuel-based hybrid motor and electrically triggered parachute deployer, the rocket is 100% pyrotechnic- and TNT-free. “The demand for small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is increasing in India. This prompted the company to focus on capturing the small satellite market while employing a hybrid propulsion system to ensure cost-effectiveness,” said Anand Megalingam, founder and CEO of Space Zone in a company post. Space Zone India launched the reusable rocket in collaboration with Martin Group, which is funding the startup.Mylswamy Annadurai, the former project director of Isro's Chandrayaan-1 mission, is the startup’s mentor.Speaking to, Annadurai, who witnessed the launch, said, “Happy to see that the next generation is ready to take the path less travelled and has the courage to explore the unexplored.” He also said, “The launch of the hybrid rocket through our hydraulic mobile launchpad is a first-of-its-kind initiative that sets a new benchmark in aerospace technology. This innovative system is designed to provide unparalleled flexibility and efficiency, allowing us to adapt to various launch scenarios with ease.”The RHUMI-1 rocket combines both liquid and solid fuel propellant systems, which will not only improve efficiency and reduce operational costs but will also ensure environmental safety.In February 2023, Space Zone India made history by launching India’s first hybrid rocket, witnessed by Isro scientists, from the Atomic Research Centre in Kalpakkam. The company has developed various rockets like RHUMI-1, RHUMI-2, and RHUMI-3, each tailored for altitudes ranging from 1 km to 500 km. Additionally, the company also designed and developed its own ground-supporting equipment for rocket launches, creating portable launch systems that can easily be moved from one location to another.",Rocket launched three Cube satellites and 50 PICO satellites to a suborbital trajectory.

Workforce of 400 million women is what India needs to steer it towards becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/workforce-of-400-million-women-is-what-india-needs-to-steer-it-towards-becoming-a-30-trillion-economy-by-2047/articleshow/112769923.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will need to brace up to double its 'Female Labour Force Participation Rate' (LFPR) to 70% by 2047 if it wants to achieve the goal of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047. This comes through in a new report that shows that achieving this goal will require $14 trillion to be contributed by women, which in turn requires as many 400 million women in the workforce .It also comes through that increasing female labour force participation to 50% can boost India’s growth rate to 9.9% and raise the country’s GDP significantly. What lies ahead is clearly a herculean task and urgent measures are required, the data analysis shows. “In 2023, the LFPR for women was 37%, far below the global average of 47% and starkly lower than the 77% for men. At current trajectory, only 110 million women are expected to join the labour force by 2047; an additional 145 million women need to be brought into the labour force to achieve the goal,” highlights the ‘Labour Force Participation Distillation Report’ launched by non-profit ‘The/Nudge Institute’ at a collaborative livelihoods summit - ‘Charcha 2024’ in the national Capital.While the report asserts that India's economic future hinges on women in the workforce, it also draws attention to the factors contributing to the vulnerability faced by women. For instance, it is stated that women were 7 times more likely to lose their jobs and 11 times more likely to not recover from their lost jobs. It also comes through that women are employed in a few gendered, low productivity sectors. “In agriculture and manufacturing, they face limited advancement, while in construction, they make up just over 12% of the workforce, earning significantly less than men in unskilled roles,” the report highlights.The report also reflects on the interplay of gender, family dynamics and income. For instance, it shows that married women are less likely to work as their husband’s income increases. Similarly, compared to households where there is no mother-in-law present, married women living in households where the mother-in-law is present but not employed are 20% (rural) to 30% (urban) less likely to be employed. However, if the mother-in-law is employed herself, daughters-in-law are 50% (rural) to 70% (urban) more likely to be employed.The analysis also reflects on the pandemic phase to draw attention to the fragility of female employment as it was that phase of crisis that pushed many rural women into or back into work due to income loss or job loss by the primary earner in the family.It comes through that a drop in rural household incomes drove women to distress employment. As incomes fell due to Covid-19 pandemic, households all over the country took on additional work to alleviate their distress. While there were cases where men took on multiple jobs to maintain their family’s sustenance, the trend was largely driven by women joining or rejoining the workforce. This included women who were previously employed in casual labour that was now unavailable, as well as those who were never or no longer a part of the labour force.“The female labour force participation rate increased, but it wasn’t accompanied by an increase in the availability of jobs for women, especially in rural areas,” the report highlights. It turns out that the vast majority of the women who joined the workforce were self employed with a majority of these women being either their own account workers or unpaid helpers. “They operate primarily in agriculture and trade (household enterprises, street vending, etc.) - two sectors that are known for being fallbacks in times of economic distress due to their low barrier of entry. This type of employment is not aspirational in its current state as incomes are low and underemployment is high,” the report states.According to the analysis in normal conditions, women who indulge in distress employment are highly likely to exit the workforce once household incomes stabilise, but that looks unlikely today. This means that they are likely to remain in the workforce for the long run, and need support to improve their incomes.On the way forward, Kanishka Chatterjee, Director, ‘The/Nudge Prize’ highlights that India’s demographic dividend cannot be realised without boosting the participation of women in the workforce. He calls for measures to address “the multifaceted barriers - economic, social, and cultural, which requires both urgent action and the patience to achieve large-scale disruption.”The report also highlights three pathways to increased labour force participation. “First would be to activate fractural employment - redefining work for women through platform jobs and digital microwork. Second would be invigorating entrepreneurship avenues through digital commerce infrastructure. Lastly, would be targeting bottlenecks like mobility and digital access that could inhibit the supply of women to labour markets,” it is stated.","India will need to double its 'Female Labour Force Participation Rate' (LFPR) to 70% by 2047 if it wants to achieve the goal of becoming a $30 trillion economy. A new report shows that achieving this goal will require $14 trillion to be contributed by women, which in turn requires as many 400 million women in the workforce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112769964,imgsize-17438,width-400,resizemode-4/112769964.jpg"

"With majority of rape victims in 18-30 age group, a new report calls for safety measures for working women",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-majority-of-rape-victims-in-18-30-age-group-a-new-report-calls-for-safety-measures-for-working-women/articleshow/112769318.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the country rages over the brutal rape and murder of a resident doctor in a govt-run hospital in Kolkata, the recently released ‘Men and Women in India 2023’ report shows that majority of rape victims as per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data are in the age group of 18-30. Given that a large number of women in this age group are stepping out to work, the report calls for greater sensitisation and safety measures to secure women’s fundamental right to “work and earn”.The NCRB data for 2022 has been stated in a chapter on ‘Impediments to Empowerment’ in the report released earlier this month by the ministry of statistics and programme implementaiton. The data show that in 2022 rape victims in the age group of 18-30 years accounted for 66% (21,063) of the total victims (31,982); 8,644 vicitms (27%) were in the 30-45 years age group; 1,171 (nearly 4%) between 45-60 years and 87 (0.3) above 60. Data from the past too reflect the same trend with NCRB 2021 report showing that of the 31,878 rape victims, 20,065 (63%) were between 18-30 years.According to the MoSPI report, the likely explanation for the elevated numbers in the 18-30 years age group may be attributed to women within this range falling under the ‘labour force’ category, requiring travel between the workplace and home. While noting that the prevalence of late working hours and onsite work locations could contribute to these statistics, the report states that “nevertheless, it is crucial to emphasise that such conditions should not serve as burdens or barriers impeding women's fundamental right to ‘work and earn’”.“The govt has already implemented various measures, including an act to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and women helpline numbers. Despite these efforts, there remains a need for further action in the realm of gender sensitisation ,” it is stated.The analysis also highlights that the lower percentage in the less than 16 years age group might be due to under-reporting stemming from the fear of social stigma. the NCRB 2022 data for rape vicitms show that 32 victims were below six years accounting for (0.1%) of total victims; there were 88 victims (0.3%) in 6 to 12 years bracket; 370 (1.2%) between 12-16 years; 570 (1.6%) between 16-18 years.The report also dwells on the worrisome issue of domestic violence as it cites data to say that it indicates that “the compromise of women’s safety often begins within the confines of their own homes”. Citing NCRB data from 2017 to 2022, the report states that three major crimes — cruelty by husband and relatives, assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty and kidnapping and abduction constituted more than 70% of the total crime committed against women. The rate of cruelty by husbands and relatives faced by women in their own house accounted for one-third of all crimes.“To effectively reduce the rates of violence and crime, it is crucial that perpetrators face swift and timely punishment,” the report states.The data also shows that the total cases of crime against women for trial in 2022 were 23.67 lakh of which 1.43 lakh cases (6.05%) have been disposed off. During the year 1.6% cases were convicted and 4.4% acquitted. These clearly indicate the high pendency in courts and the need for quicker disposal,” the report states.","The report calls for greater sensitisation and safety measures to secure women’s fundamental right to ‘work and earn’ The data show that in 2022 rape victims in the age group of 18-30 years accounted for 66% (21,063) of the total victims (31,982)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112769306,imgsize-109658,width-400,resizemode-4/112769306.jpg"

This is a massive achievement for Govt of India.”He said it was “particularly satisfying” to see Chhattisgarh home minister Vijay Sharma visiting Maoist commander Hidma’s village (Puwarti, Sukma district) and distributing Aadhaar cards and Ayushman Bharat cards to villagers.Due to PM Narendra Modi ’s strategy, people in Madhya Pradesh’s Chandameta village and six villages in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma could vote in the elections for the first time in 40 years, he said. “This is a victory for security forces and for democracy. Today, central forces are not only fighting Maoists but also monitoring development activities ,” Shah added.Despite August being part of the period under review, 189 Maoists have been “neutralized” in Chhattisgarh, which accounts for 90% of LWE-affected area, Shah said, adding that the setting up of police camps in areas where Maoists are still active helped fill the security vacuum.Chhattisgarh is the best performing state in tackling Maoists this year, he said. Praising Chhattisgarh CM Vishnudeo Sai and his deputies Vijay Sharma and Arun Sao, he said ever since BJP formed govt, they have worked in a determined manner to root out Maoist insurgency. Apart from the Maoists eliminated, 559 have been arrested and 540 surrendered this year, he said, adding that 47 special forces camps have been set up.Sixteen more camps will be set up in the coming months as the distance between police and locals has decreased. The credit for this should be given to the better implementation of the policies run by the Sai govt,” Shah said.While only 219 Maoists were killed in five years during the tenure of the previous govt, the continuous encounter and surrender of Naxalites in just eight months is being considered a major achievement of the Vishnu Deo Sai govt, the Union home minister said.Shah said that the Niyad Nellnar scheme in the state is being considered a milestone for development in the Maoist-affected area. Under this scheme, the availability of 53 public welfare and 28 community schemes of 17 departments is being ensured.Shah urged Maoists to take up the “new-look surrender policy” that will be unveiled by Chhattisgarh govt in one or two months.The DGPs and chief secretaries of all states that share a border with Chhattisgarh are attending the review meeting with the home minister. “States connected to Chhattisgarh are part of this because neighbouring states also need to have an equally strong ecosystem to tackle Maoists and speed up development,” Shah explained. Heads of all paramilitary forces also attended the discussions.The aim is to have 100% saturation of welfare and development programmes of the state and Centre in areas affected by Maoist insurgency, and to remove hurdles, he added.“I believe the time has come to deal a ruthless final blow to Maoists with a strong battle plan,” Shah said, adding: “We all agree that LWE is the biggest challenge to India’s democratic system... The battle is in its final stages. Under PM Modi’s strategy, it will be eradicated completely by March 2026.”The Union home minister said that 17,000 people have been killed due to the insurgency in the last four decades. “Ever since BJP formed govt at the Centre under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this problem was taken up as a challenge. Our aim was to establish rule of law in these areas by getting Maoists to give up arms, and engaging those who don’t,” he said.The objective was to ensure that development activities saturate the regions that had fallen behind due to Maoist insurgency so that they can be brought on a par with the rest of India, Shah said, adding that he is very happy with the development on both fronts.“The Centre is committed to developing the region, from Bastar to Bijapur, and Dantewada to Dhamtari, and liberating them from Maoist extremism,” he reiterated. A State Investigation Agency (SIA) has been set up on the line of NIA and it will be strengthened, he said.Listing the achievements of the anti-Maoist operations, he said that in 2022, the number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time in four decades. “The 2014-2024 period saw the least acts of Maoist violence and 14 top Maoist leaders were neutralized. We succeeded in generating people’s trust in ‘vikas’ (progress),” Shah added.Putting the govt’s success in numbers, the Union home minister said that there were 16,463 incidents of violence from 2004-14, which dropped by 53% to 7,444. In the earlier period, 6,617 security personnel lost their lives, which has been reduced by 70%, he added.“In 2010, 96 districts reported violence. Eleven more districts were created since then, but now only 42 districts report such cases. In 2010, 456 police stations registered acts of Maoist violence. Around 100 new ones were set up. Out of these 565 police stations, only 171 now have such cases,” he said.“Since 2019, 277 new police camps have been set up, filling the security vacuum, 90 cases have been registered under a new NIA vertical, 64 chargesheets have been filed and a severe blow has been dealt by Indian agencies to LWE finance ecosystem.

With funds of Rs 21400 crore and 15,300 telephone towers, the connectivity problem has been resolved. To solve road connectivity issues, Rs 21000 crore was sanctioned to build 17,500km of roads, of which 11,500km has already been completed,” Shah said.To promote financial inclusion in 25 worst-affected districts, 2,796 bank branches have been opened, along with 2,061 ATMS.

This is a first in the country,” the home minister said.To upscale skilling in these parts, 48 ITIs were to be opened, of which 46 are already operational, he said, adding: “In the last four years, 165 Eklavya schools have been opened. Compare this with only 38 in the last 40 years. Eleven Kendriya Vidyalayas and four Navodaya Vidyalayas have been opened, he said.At Saturday’s meeting, the home ministry decided to launch a campaign, in coordination with states, to educate those who were forced to remain illiterate because of the Maoist insurgency, Shah said, assuring that tendu patta rates will be revised.Earlier in the day, Shah began his Chhattisgarh visit with a darshan at Vallabhacharya temple in Champaran, some 50km from Raipur.

Chief minister Mohan Majhi has approved this decision.“According to the admission guideline , students who have taken admission in the first phase cannot take part in the second phase.But many of the students were not aware of this. They had thought that they could get a seat in a college in the second phase if they did not take part in the first phase of admission,” said Suraj.He said many students take the help of a third person to fill up their application online. If the third person does not sensitise the students about the guidelines of the admission, there is a chance the students may not know the process of admission. “This guideline was prepared to reduce the duration of the long admission process,” he added.However, the minister said, the department has made a small change to the guideline for the benefit of thousands of students. “Many students and their kin urged the chief minister, me, and the higher education department requesting the change. Govt could not set this request aside and gave an opportunity to students to take part in the second phase of admission,” he added.The minister further said the department has already implemented this decision from Friday and opened the website of the Student Academic Management System (SAMS) for applying for Phase-II UG admission . “We have done this in the interest of the students. It will immensely help them to get a college of their choice,” he added.Students and their parents met the higher education minister here and thanked him for the much-needed change. The Phase-II UG admission process started from August 12 and will continue till September 14.“I had applied for a UG course in the Phase-I admission and took admission in a college 40km from my village. I want to take admission in a college near my village, that’s why I will apply for the second phase of admission. The change in the guideline will help me to do this,” said Ankita Jena, a student from Ganjam.","Suryabanshi Suraj said students who have already taken admission in the Phase I undergraduate (UG) admission can now take part in Phase-II admission process.
