The land in the village is gradually subsiding towards the Teesta River , which has raised concerns and fear among the local residents.Urging the Indian government for immediate attention, Nim Tshering Lepcha, a victim and a Local Representative of the Naga Village said, ""Relocation of the affected people is necessary at the moment as well as the restoration of the border road...It has been 11 months (since glacial lake outburst flood in 2023) and there's no improvement. The Government of India should also take up this matter seriously as this is a border road.""""It does not only concern the general public, but also is a threat of national security,"" Nim added.The Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) that caused the disaster in Sikkim last year could be a warning of the significant threat such events pose to the three million Indians living in vulnerable regions across the six Himalayan states and UTs: Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh.In February last year, an international team of scientists led by Newcastle University in the UK conducted the first global assessment of areas at risk from Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Their study, published in the journal Nature Communications, highlighted that India and Pakistan account for one-third of the global population exposed to GLOFs. The research also noted that the risk to populations grows with increasing proximity to a glacial lake.","Nearly 300 families were evacuated in Sikkim's Mangan district after a few buildings collapsed in the border region.

The Congress MP said he will wait for the central probing agency with open arms after ED 'insiders' informed him that a raid was being planned.Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah , Gandhi said, ""Apparently, 2 in 1 didn’t like my Chakravyuh speech.ED ‘insiders’ tell me a raid is being planned.""""Waiting with open arms @dir_ed…..Chai and biscuits on me,"" he added.Gandhi, in his Parliament speech had accused the NDA government of spreading a 'chakravyuh' with everybody trapped in it, including BJP MPs, farmers and workers.

I did a little research and found out that 'Chakravyuh' is also known as 'Padmavuyh' - which means 'Lotus formation'. Chakravyuh' is in the shape of a Lotus. In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus. The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest. What was done with Abhimanyu, is being down with India - the youth, farmers, women, small and medium businesses. Abhimanyu was killed by six people. Today, too there are six people in the centre of 'Chakravyuh'. Six people control India today too -Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Mohan Bhagwat, Ajit Doval, Ambani and Adani,"" he added.Gandhi on Monday also attacked finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for not mentioning the paper-leak issue in the Budget speech , which he said is the 'biggest issue affecting youth.'

Such climatic conditions are generally associated with good monsoon rainfall in India. Nevertheless, certain parts of the country may still face 'below normal' rainfall like what eight states experienced in July.""During the second half of the monsoon season, normal to above normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of northeast and adjoining areas of east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra & Kutch, and some isolated pockets of central and peninsular India where below normal rainfall is likely,"" said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.Releasing the forecast for Aug, Mohapatra said ""normal to above normal rainfall"" is likely over many parts of the country this month, except many areas in southern parts of central and adjoining northern peninsular India, northeast and adjoining areas of east India, some parts of northwest and south peninsular India, where below normal rainfall is likely.Though the country recorded 11% deficit monsoon rainfall in June, the sowing operations in many parts of the country continued unabated with the help of irrigation using groundwater. Despite a skewed distribution of rainfall, July finally logged out with 9% more rains than normal. It helped farmers to increase acreages in the rain-fed areas, bringing the total sown area at 812 lakh hectares as on last Friday which was 18 lakh hectares more than the corresponding period last year.",There is strong possibility of formation of La Nina conditions by the end of this month.

Rankireddy and Shetty, previously ranked number one globally, advanced as the leaders of Group C, setting up their encounter with Chia and Soh, who were the runners-up in Group A, trailing behind the world's top-ranked pair from China, Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang.The Malaysian team, which once dominated the head-to-head record against the Indian shuttlers with eight consecutive wins, has recently faced three consecutive defeats in their latest matchups.A victory in this quarterfinal would potentially pit the Indian pair against the tournament's top seeds, Liang and Wang, assuming the latter triumphs over the Indonesian team of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in their quarterfinal match.The competition between the Indian and Malaysian pairs has always been fiercely contested, with both sides aspiring to clinch their country's first badminton gold medal in the Olympics.The Malaysian pair is recognized for their strategic prowess, precision, and fast-paced gameplay. In contrast, Rankireddy and Shetty are known for their aggressive playing style, which they will need to employ effectively from the start to overcome their opponents.Having previously experienced several defeats against Chia and Soh, the Indian pair managed to secure their first victory against the Malaysians at the Indonesia Open Super 1000 final in the previous year, followed by wins at the 2022 Asian Games individual event and the India Open.Elsewhere in the tournament, the second half of the draw features a match between the second-seeded Danish pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Rasmussen and the fourth-seeded Korean team of Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Seung Jae.Furthermore, Thailand's Supak Jomkoh and Kedren Kittinupong will compete against the Tokyo Olympic gold medallists Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin from Chinese Taipei, promising a series of compelling matches in the men's doubles category.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty to face Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in quarterfinals.

The month of August marks a period of heightened involvement in academic and extracurricular activities for both school and college students. With the commencement of the new school year or semester in the previous month following summer vacations, students are deeply immersed in their studies and regular class attendance.August is also notable for several culturally significant holidays that are important to students and other stakeholders.Unlike July, which had almost no holidays, August 2024 offers students multiple school holidays, providing opportunities for relaxation amidst their ongoing classes and school activities.Schools across India will observe holidays for Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi, and Krishna Janmashtami. Additionally, in the middle of the month, India will celebrate its 77th Independence Day, a national holiday during which schools, colleges, and other institutions will be closed.Overall in the month of August 2024, there are a total of nine school holidays, including Saturdays and Sundays. Here's the complete list-Independence Day commemorates India's liberation from British colonial rule in 1947. It's a national holiday marked by patriotic fervor, parades, and celebrations, honoring the sacrifices of freedom fighters.Raksha Bandhan is a cherished festival celebrating the unbreakable bond between siblings. Sisters tie a sacred thread (rakhi) on their brother's wrist, symbolizing protection and love. In return, brothers pledge to protect their sisters.Janmashtami is a joyous occasion dedicated to the birth of Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Devotees observe fasts, decorate homes, and participate in midnight prayers and celebrations. It's a time for spiritual reflection and devotion.In addition to the scheduled holidays in August, there are several important observances, such as awareness days, the birth anniversaries of prominent figures, and other significant events. These days, while not traditional holidays, are observed in schools to honour their significance and help students understand the significance. Here's the list-","Schools across India will observe holidays for Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi, and Krishna Janmashtami.

CHATEAUROUX: ""No time to celebrate. My work is unfinished. There's a lot to play for,"" Manu Bhaker had said after winning her first Olympic medal on Sunday. There indeed was a lot more at stake. There was a date with history too. The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games. Bhaker wins bronze in 10m air pistol mixed team event. She is the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Games. Norman Pritchard won two silver medals in the 1900 Games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112153728,imgsize-104908,width-400,resizemode-4/112153728.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's aide Bibhav Kumar , who is accused of assaulting AAP MP Swati Maliwal , and expressed shock at the details of the incident recorded by the Delhi high court.""Is CM residence a private bungalow? Is this kind of 'goon' supposed to work in the CM's residence?"" the bench asked Singhvi, who said there were non-serious injuries and the FIR was lodged after three days of the incident on May 13.The bench further questioned Singhvi about the implications of Maliwal, an AAP Rajya Sabha MP, calling the police helpline during the assault. They emphasized that while they routinely grant bail to contract killers, murderers, and robbers, the nature of this incident troubled them.""Every day we grant bail to contract killers, murderers, robbers but the question is what kind of incident...He (Bibhav Kumar) acted as if some 'goon' had entered the official residence of CM,"" the Supreme Court observed.""We are shocked? Is this a way to deal with a young lady? He (Bibhav Kumar) assaulted her even after she told about her physical conditions,"" it said.This came after a court on Tuesday took cognisance of charge sheet against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar in the alleged assault of Maliwal.The Aam Aadmi Party MP has accused Kumar of abusing and slapping her ""at least seven to eight times"" and hitting her in the stomach.Providing chilling details of the incident, Maliwal had said, ""At that time, he pounced on me, brutally dragged me and deliberately pulled my shirt up. My shirt buttons opened and my shirt flew up. I landed on the floor while hitting my head on the centre table. I was constantly screaming for help but no one came. After that, Bibhav Kumar did not relent and attacked me by kicking me in my chest, stomach and pelvis area with his legs. I was in extreme pain and kept telling him to stop. My shirt was coming up but he still continued to assault me.""Kumar faces multiple charges under the Indian Penal Code 1860, including wrongful restraint (Section 341), assault or criminal force intended to outrage a woman's modesty (Section 354), assault or criminal force aimed at disrobing a woman (Section 354B), criminal intimidation (Section 506), insult to a woman's modesty (Section 509), attempt to commit culpable homicide (Section 308), and destruction of evidence or providing false information (Section 201).On July 12, the Delhi high court denied bail to Kumar, citing his significant power and potential to influence witnesses in the case. Kumar was arrested on May 18 after a complaint by Maliwal alleging assault, which led to the registration of the case against him under various sections of the IPC.","The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar.

The room, typically filled with the chatter of students, had transformed into a temporary morgue.

BENGALURU: As the possibility of Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot giving sanction to prosecute CM Siddaramaiah over a land allotment scam at Mysuru Urban Development Authority loomed large on Thursday, the CM insisted he would fight the graft charge legally and politically, ruling out any possibility of resignation .The CM's firm stand followed a breakfast meet with his cabinet colleagues at his official residence, Cauvery, and a subsequent meeting of the council of ministers led by deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar.A meeting of the council of ministers was led by dy CM DK Shivakumar. CM Siddaramaiah, though, did not attend. Showing its intent to play hardball with the governor, the council of ministers decided to advise Gehlot to withdraw the show-cause notice and reject the petition that sought his sanction to prosecute Siddaramaiah.The two meetings aimed to ensure all ministers were on the same page before engaging in a legal and political battle against the BJP-JD(S) opposition combine. The opposition parties have already announced a seven-day padayatra to press for the CM’s resignation.“The show-cause notice to the CM is gross misuse of the constitutional office of governor and politically motivated,” Shivakumar said after the meeting. “It is a concerted effort to destabilise our govt, elected with a majority of 136 seats. The governor has not followed due procedure. He should have acted only on the advice of the council of ministers and not at his discretion,” he added.“The speed with which Raj Bhavan sent the show-cause notice to the CM — a few hours after the petition was filed — shows the governor did not even read the petition in detail since it contains about 60 pages. He did not apply his mind to the facts of the case or consider the material available on record,” said Shivakumar. He contrasted Gehlot’s alacrity with lethargy in cases involving BJP functionaries, including former ministers Shashikala Jolle and Murugesh Nirani, and the decade-long unresolved petition against former minister G Janardhana Reddy.On July 26, the governor had issued a show-cause notice to Siddaramaiah over the Muda scam. He is still awaiting his reply.Advocate and anti-graft activist TJ Abraham said if the governor green-lights prosecution under Prevention of Corruption Act, he “will immediately have to approach the magistrate’s court and seek directions for the police or Lokayukta to register an FIR and investigate the scam”. Abraham had petitioned the governor on July 26 seeking his sanction to prosecute Siddaramaiah.Alternatively, the court may directly start trial by issuing summons to the CM and his wife, potentially forcing Siddaramaiah to resign on moral grounds, Abraham added. Some legal experts, though, emphasised that resignation was not mandatory. “To resign or not to resign is more of a moral consideration. There is no law that specifies the requirement of resignation of the CM,” said a constitutional expert.Siddaramaiah’s stance mirrors Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s, who remained in office despite facing arrest in the alleged excise scam. Former CM BS Yediyurappa also continued to be in office despite facing prosecution under Corruption Act in 2011.Following discussions with the Congress high command, including AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, a consensus was reportedly reached on taking BJP head-on. Launching a scathing attack on BJP, senior Congress ministers accused the party of “misusing” Raj Bhavan.",Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot may give sanction to prosecute CM Siddaramaiah over a land allotment scam.

The Indian PM said new steps were being taken to increase defence and security cooperation , including the inauguration of an army software park in the coastal city of Nha Trang.A powerful pillar of India’s Act East policy, Vietnam has seen ties with its Communist neighbour improve lately, and President Xi Jinping visited Hanoi last year, but it remains, like some of its other Asean neighbours, at the receiving end of China’s expansive and contested nine-dash line claim over SCS waters.""We share unison in our views regarding the Indo-Pacific region. We will continue our cooperation for a free, open, rules-based and prosperous Indo-Pacific,’’ said Modi, adding they also emphasised cooperation on the issues of terrorism and cyber security.Apart from the credit lines that will be used by Vietnam for defence procurement, and the plan of action for the implementation of the comprehensive strategic partnership during the 2024-2028, the 2 sides signed 7 other agreements. Pham said in his media statement both sides agreed to share information and work together to ensure peace and stability in SCS. In a joint statement, the leaders reaffirmed the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight in the SCS, while pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS ), without resorting to threat or use of force.Following the recent escalation in China-Philippines tensions over their dispute in SCS, both leaders underscored the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states, and ``avoidance of actions that could further complicate the situation or escalate disputes affecting peace and stability’’.""Both leaders emphasized the legal framework set out by the UNCLOS within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, and that UNCLOS is the basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones,"" said the joint statement. India had earlier this week joined Quad nations in saying in a joint statement that the 2016 arbitral tribunal award, which refuted Beijing’s claims in its dispute with the Philippines, should form the basis for the resolution of such disputes in the region.Defence and security remains the most important of the 5 pillars that the strategic partnership is based on. The other pillars are politics-diplomacy, economic-trade, science-technology and culture-education. According to the joint statement, the leaders agreed to further enhance defence cooperation based on mutual interest and priorities of the two countries which will also contribute to ``greater stability in the wider Indo-Pacific region’’. Despite China’s objection against exploration in the contested SCS waters, India and Vietnam have continued with their partnership in the oil and gas sector, including exploration and production in Vietnam’s continental shelf. The leaders underlined the significance of this ``mutually beneficial’’ cooperation.For India, it’s significant that the joint statement unequivocally condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism. ""They stressed the importance of international collaboration in combating this menace in accordance with international law, particularly the principles of the United Nations Charter, and reiterated their commitment to joint efforts in this endeavour,"" it said.",India and Vietnam announced a new plan of action to boost their comprehensive strategic partnership.

Recurring disasters in Kerala



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: As the national attention turns to Wayanad where rescue operations are in full swing after deadly landslides which has claimed the lives of over 280 people till now, the Kerala government has issued a directive for the scientists banning them from visiting the affected sites and issuing any statement regarding it.In a letter to the principal secretary of the department of science and technology, the state relief commissioner has asked him to direct all scientific institution to not visit the sites.""You are requested to direct all Science and Technology institutions in the State of Kerala not to undertake any field visits to Meppadi Panchayath, Wayanad which is notified as a disaster affected area,"" the letter said.The order also states that the scientific community should refrain from sharing any statement or opinion without permission.""The scientific community shall be directed to restrain themselves from sharing their opinions and study reports to media. If any study is to be undertaken in the disaster affected area, prior permission shall be obtained from Kerala State Disaster Management Authority,"" the letter stated.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, later asked the officials to take back the order.Meanwhile, new satellite images released by National Remote Sensing Centre, a key centre under Isro, showed the extent of devastation.The high-resolution before-and-after images captures by the Risat (whose radar can penetrate clouds) and Cartosat-3 (advanced optical satellite) show that approximately 86,000 square metres of land slipped away. The resulting debris flow travelled about 8km along the Iruvaiphuzha river, devastating towns and settlements in its path.Climate change, fragile terrain and loss of forest cover created the perfect recipe for the devastating landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district that claimed 123 lives, according to studies conducted over the years. Extremely heavy rain triggered a series of landslides in the hilly areas of Wayanad.According to the landslide atlas released by the Indian Space Research Organisation's National Remote Sensing Centre last year, 10 out of the 30 most landslide-prone districts in India were in Kerala, with Wayanad ranked 13th.It said 0.09 million square kilometres in the Western Ghats and the Konkan hills (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra) were prone to landslides.""The vulnerability of inhabitants and households is more significant in the Western Ghats due to the very high population and household density, especially in Kerala,"" the report read.A study published by Springer in 2021 said all landslide hotspots in Kerala were in the Western Ghats region and concentrated in Idukki, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Wayanad, Kozhikode and Malappuram districts.It said about 59 per cent of total landslides in Kerala occurred in plantation areas.A 2022 study on depleting forest cover in Wayanad showed that 62 per cent of forests in the district disappeared between 1950 and 2018 while plantation cover rose by around 1,800 per cent.The study, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, said around 85 per cent of the total area of Wayanad was under forest cover until the 1950s.According to scientists, climate change was increasing the possibility of landslides in the Western Ghats, one of the eight ""hottest hotspots"" of biological diversity in the world.In August 2018, Kerala experienced a devastating flood that claimed the lives of 483 people and was considered the state's worst flood in a century. The catastrophe not only resulted in the loss of lives but also caused extensive damage to property and livelihoods, prompting the central government to declare it a ""calamity of severe nature"".As Kerala was recovering from the 2018 floods, another tragedy struck in 2019 when a landslide in Puthumala, Wayanad, approximately 10 km from the currently affected areas, claimed 17 lives. In October 2021, heavy rainfall triggered landslides in Idukki and Kottayam districts, resulting in the death of 35 people.According to data provided by the IMD, heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents in 2021 led to the loss of 53 lives in Kerala. Exactly a year later, in August 2022, landslides and flash floods caused by heavy rains claimed 18 lives, damaged hundreds of properties, and forced thousands of people to seek shelter in relief camps, as reported by the state government.During the 2022 rain-related incidents, over 5,000 individuals were evacuated from disaster-hit and disaster-prone regions of the state and accommodated in 178 relief camps. The ministry of earth sciences has reported that Kerala has experienced the highest number of landslides in the country, with 2,239 out of 3,782 landslides occurring in the state between 2015 and 2022.","The Kerala government has issued a directive for the scientists banning them from visiting the affected sites.

Quota crusader who states his cause in black & white,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-crusader-who-states-his-cause-in-black-white/articleshow/112209305.cms,"HYDERABAD: Apart from world leaders like Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Pope Francis, Vladimir Putin, former ISRO chief K Sivan and Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, there are very few people that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has publicly hugged. It is for this reason that many were surprised when he hugged and consoled a Dalit activist little known outside Telangana and Andhra Pradesh at a public meeting in Secunderabad on Nov 11 last year during the peak of the assembly election campaign in Telangana.Meet Manda Krishna Madiga , who has been fighting for sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) for three decades. At last year's public meeting with Madiga on stage, Modi announced that he supported the demand. An emotional Madiga couldn't hold back his tears and received a consoling hug from the PM.Those who saw TV footage of the meeting may not have given a second thought to the activist's attire, dressed in white shirt and black pants with a black scarf hanging loosely around his shoulders.What may seem like a dull detail is in fact a sign of Madiga's commitment to his cause. He has decided that he will keep wearing black as a mark of protest until discrimination against Dalits ends. Any picture from the past 30 years -- there are many of him protesting -- shows him in only black and white .""I will not change these two colours even if we succeed in our fight for sub-categorisation,"" Madiga had told TOI earlier during an exclusive interview. ""These are the only two colours I have and these are the only two colours I will wear until the day discrimination against Dalits ends.""The 59-year-old founded Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS) on July 7, 1994, and has been raising the demand ever since. He decided not to give up the fight despite facing hurdles because he was confident the cause was genuine. ""Remember that when Ambedkar proposed reservation for SCs and STs, many people opposed but finally, it had become a reality,"" Madiga said.Explaining his conviction, Madiga pointed out that ""I kept the faith even when I felt bad over my fellow Madigas dying while fighting for justice"".""Many MRPS workers committed suicide and were murdered in the past years. In East and West Godavari districts in united Andhra Pradesh, MRPS workers died after they were attacked by other community members. But we decided not to take revenge as our primary aim of (SC) sub-categorisation would have been side-tracked,"" Madiga said.He added: ""MRPS workers also died at Gandhi Bhavan (Congress HQ at Hyderabad), when they tried to set ablaze furniture in 2009.

"Ruling a challenge for government, may intensify Dalit tensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ruling-a-challenge-for-government-may-intensify-dalit-tensions/articleshow/112209108.cms,"NEW DELHI: Passage of time has blunted the strident opposition that existed to the controversial proposal of sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes, because its implementation in states for years made the hostile strong sub-castes reconcile to its possibility, which in turn made political parties shed fears of a backlash from the stronger sub-groups.But that is true only about the states, whom the Supreme Court has empowered to carry out sub-categorisation of SCs .In contrast, the apex court verdict has lobbed a nettlesome issue into the court of the Centre . BJP will be expected to spell out its stance on sub-categorising the SCs at the central level, since PM Narendra Modi is seen to have played the catalyst on the long dormant issue with his sharing of stage with Madiga activists in Telangana during the assembly election campaign, and his government's decision to send out a signal in favour of sub-classification with the constitution of a high-powered committee headed by the cabinet secretary ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.Dividing the SCs at the grand national level, away from localised state audiences, risks attracting the cumulative ire of stronger Dalit groups from across the states, who would view it as a hostile act cutting into their share of affirmative action benefits.How soon the Centre and the states act on the judgement would be keenly watched. What is likely to add an edge to the reaction of certain stronger groups, besides individual reactions across the board, is not sub-categorisation but the introduction of ""creamy layer"" among the Dalits, as ruled by the supreme court. Already a serious issue among the OBCs since the concept was introduced in the wake of Mandal commission, the extension of the weeding out criteria to Dalits would be watched for the response of the community.After all, as is argued, ""creamy layer"" has the potential to choke the supply line of Dalits into the representation chain, which is based on the competitive ability of groups which cannot be achieved overnight. It is a tricky issue, which can test the states as well as the Centre. Sub-categorisation entails division of the SC list into groups of communities based on their status of backwardness and apportioning of total quota quantum among them in proportion to their population.But the method of accomplishing it, with the supreme court seeking a survey for empirical data on representation of different castes in public services, puts the spotlight on the controversial issue of caste census. Observers say the green light to sub-classification of SCs can give a fresh impetus to demands for sub-categorisation of OBCs, an issue for which the Centre formed the Rohini commission but has been sitting on its report. The report was submitted on July 31, 2023, six years after it was constituted.There are already calls that caste census would be required for sub-classification of not just the SCs but also the OBCs. Caste census has emerged as the agenda of the opposition, with Congress, SP, DMK, RJD, its champions, as against the BJP which is seen as stonewalling the push.",Supreme Court verdict has lobbed a nettlesome issue into the court of the Centre.

Quota within SC quota: Quite a legal roller coaster for decades-old demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-within-sc-quota-quite-a-legal-roller-coaster-for-decades-old-demand/articleshow/112209134.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grievances of the most backward among Scheduled Castes of being deprived of reservation benefits by those socio-economically advanced among them dates back to the 1960s but it took the shape of a legislation for the first time in Andhra Pradesh with the enactment of AP Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000.The law divided SCs into four categories and provided for apportionment of reservation among them - 1 per cent for Group A, 7 per cent for Group B, 6 per cent for Group C and 1 per cent again for Group D.This law was upheld by the HC, but a five-judge Supreme Court bench in EV Chinnaiah case struck it down by ruling that SCs are a homogeneous group and cannot be sub-categorised.In 2006, Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act was enacted providing for reservation of 25 per cent for SCs and within that, 50 per cent was be given to particular SC castes such as Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs in direct recruitment. This was struck down by the HC in 2010 adhering to the Chinnaiah judgment. When Punjab appealed against it, the SC had referred it to a seven-judge bench in 2011. History of deprivation of benefits of reservation to castes within the SC group is decades old. In 1997, the AP govt had set up Justice P Ramachandra Raju Commission, which opined that benefits of reservation had largely gone to a particular caste among the SCs and, therefore, recommended categorising SCs into four groups.In 2001, UP had constituted the Hukam Singh Committee, which found that benefits of reservation had not percolated down to people belonging to the most depressed classes. It said Yadavs alone garnered the maximum share of jobs. It had recommended sub-categorisation of the list of SCs/OBCs.In 2003, Maharashtra had set up the Lahuji Salve Commission to study socio-economic conditions of Mang caste in the list of SCs. The commission recommended sub-classification of SCs as Mangs, the lowest in the caste hierarchy, had not adequately benefited fromquota .In 2005, Karnataka set up Justice AJ Sadashiva panel to identify castes among SCs who had not benefited from quota. The panel recommended division of 101 castes into four categories with 15 per cent of the total reservation of SCs to each of the categories.In 2007, Bihar's Mahadalit panel recommended inclusion of 18 castes as extremely weaker castes from among the list of SCs. In the same year, Justice Jasraj Chopra Committee of Rajasthan recommended that Gurjars, being extremely backward, be provided with better facilities than those available to OBCs. In 2008, Tamil Nadu's Justice MS Janarthanam panel recommended that Arunthathiyars deserved differential treatment in quota.Based on K Ratna Prabha Committee recommendations in 2017, Karnataka enacted a law in 2018 providing consequential seniority to govt servants promoted on the basis of reservation. This law was upheld by the SC.",History of deprivation of benefits of reservation to castes within the SC group is decades old. Grievances of the most backward among Scheduled Castes dates back to the 1960s. It took the shape of a legislation for the first time in Andhra Pradesh in 2000.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112209215,imgsize-1493191,width-400,resizemode-4/112209215.jpg"
Quota row: Supreme Court bats for the deprived among unequals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-row-supreme-court-bats-for-the-deprived-among-unequals/articleshow/112208995.cms,"One judge differs with other six, says SCs are a homogenous

group

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said a Scheduled Caste parent's children studying in St Stephen's College cannot be equated with another SC parent's children who study in rural schools and, hence, cannot claim identical right to avail 15 per cent reservation in jobs and admissions to educational institutions earmarked for SCs .Justice Bhushan R Gavai, the lone Dalit judge in the seven-judge bench that permitted sub-categorisation of castes within the SC community, showed courage in tackling what has been a political hot potato and asked states to devise a framework to identify and eliminate creamy layer among SCs and STs from availing reservation benefits.He said the OBC creamy layer principle can't be applied to SCs and STs.""I am therefore of the view that the state must evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes so as exclude them from the benefit of affirmative action . In my view, only this and this alone can achieve the real equality as enshrined under the Constitution,"" he said. CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma concurred with Justice Gavai.He said unequals among SCs and STs can't be treated equally and asked, ""Can a child of IAS/IPS or civil service officers be equated with a child of a disadvantaged member belonging to Scheduled Castes studying in a gram panchayat/zilla parishad school in a village?""He said equating children of SC/ST parents, who after availing reservation have reached high positions and ceased to be socially, economically and educationally backward, with children of parents engaged in manual work would defeat the constitutional mandate.In a 281-page opinion replete with quotes of Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, Justice Gavai said children of SC civil servants have access to advanced education and better social environment compared to those of SC parents studying in the hinterland. ""I have no hesitation to hold that putting a child studying in St Paul's High School and St Stephen's College and a child studying in a small village in a backward and remote area in the same bracket would obliviate the equality principle enshrined in the Constitution,"" he said.Advocating framing of a suitable creamy layer exclusion criteria for SCs and STs, different from that applied to OBCs, he said as the Constitution recognises SCs and STs to be the most backward among backward classes, the criteria has to be different from the existing one.""If a person from such a category, by bagging the benefit of reservation, achieved a position of a peon or maybe a sweeper, he would continue to belong to a socially, economically and educationally backward class. At the same time, people from this category, who after having availed the benefits of reservation have reached high echelons in life cannot be considered to be socially, economically and educationally backward so as to continue availing the benefit of affirmative action. They have already reached a stage where on their own accord they should walk out of the special provisions and give way to the deserving and needy,"" Justice Gavai said.Justice Mithal agreed with Justice Gavai but took the creamy layer exclusion policy to a different level. He said, ""The reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in a family has taken advantage of reservation and have achieved higher status, benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation."" Unlike Justice Gavai's opinion, Justice Mithal's singular opinion would not have binding effect.Justice Bela M Trivedi opined that castes classified as Scheduled Castes are a homogeneous group and cannot be sub-categorised based on degree of backwardness, an opinion which was in sync with the Supreme Court's 2004 ruling by a five-judge bench that was overruled on Thursday by a seven-judge bench by six to one majority.Justice Trivedi disbanded the dynamic interpretation given to constitutional provisions on affirmative action by states for SCs and STs by six other judges - CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices B R Gavai, Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma - and took the strict and literal interpretation to object to the majority opinion favouring sub-categorisation of SCs and devising appropriate creamy layer exclusion criteria for SCs and STs.""While giving a broad and generous construction to constitutional provisions, the rule of 'plain meaning', or 'literal' interpretation, which is the 'primary rule', has to be kept in mind,"" she said.Terming the 2004 judgment in EV Chinnaiah case to be correct law, Justice Trivedi said, ""It is only Parliament by law which can include or exclude from the list of 'Scheduled Castes' specified in the notification notified under Clause (1), any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe. Such notification notified under Clause (1) cannot be varied even by the President by issuing any subsequent notification.""Etymological and evolutionary history and the background of the nomenclature SCs, coupled with the presidential orders published under Article 341 of the Constitution, make the SCs a homogenous class, which cannot be tinkered with by states.""She further said, ""States have no legislative competence to enact the law for providing reservation or giving preferential treatment to a particular caste/castes by dividing/sub-dividing/sub-classifying or regrouping the castes, races or tribes enumerated as the SCs in the notification under Article 341."" She added that this cannot even be done under the guise of taking affirmative action for the weaker of the weakest sections of society.Take for example the practical aspect considered by Justice Gavai to highlight how some castes, because of their socio-economic uplift through high-ranking jobs, have cornered the lion's share of the quota meant for SCs and opposing equitable distribution of reservation benefits.Justice Gavai said, ""I find that the attitude of the categories in the Presidential List opposing such a sub-classification is that of a person in the general compartment of the train. Firstly, persons outside the compartment struggled to get into the general compartment. However, once they get inside it, they make every attempt possible to prevent persons outside such a compartment from entering it.""","Justice Bhushan R Gavai, the lone Dalit judge, showed courage in tackling what has been a political hot potato. He asked states to devise a framework to identify and eliminate creamy layer among SCs and STs from availing reservation benefits.

"Cabinet may consider today Rs 50,000 crore plan to build 8 key highways",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-may-consider-today-rs-50000-crore-plan-to-build-8-key-highways/articleshow/112208835.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cabinet is likely to take up eight major highway development proposals worth around Rs 50,000 crore for approval on Friday. These projects are spread across Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal.TOI has learnt that the projects include 68-km Ayodhya Bypass, 121-km Guwahati Ring Road, 516-km Kharagpur-Siliguri expressway, 6-lane Agra Gwalior greenfield highway (88 km) and an 30-km long elevated highway having eight lanes between Nasik and Khed (Pune).All the projects will be built on public private partnership (PPP) mode, sources said. NHAI has invited bids for most of these projects and has held rounds of meetings with highway developers to elicit more interest among them.Since all these big projects cost more than Rs 1,000 crore under PPP needs to be appraised by inter-ministerial panel of PPPAC and must get the cabinet's approval for bidding . ""There are some players who are keen to take up only PPP projects. We have got good feedback. Once the cabinet gives its nod, we will go ahead with awarding them,"" an official said.Meanwhile, sources said govt may not give umbrella approval for any highway development scheme in the near future like ""Bharatmala"", meaning the road transport and highways ministry will need to send each project costing more than Rs 1,000 crore to cabinet for approval. The highway ministry is likely to send a list of more projects it plans to take to the cabinet for approval by December. Sources said to streamline the process of land acquisition for projects, the highway agencies will be allowed to go for 3D notification only after getting Cabinet approval . In the case of widening of brownfield highways, the 3D notification will be issued after a high-level committee finalises the alignments and gives its approval.","The projects are spread across Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal.

It emphasised that CUET scores will remain the primary criteria for student admission.According to SOP issued by UGC for central universities to fill their vacant seats, even aspirants who had appeared for CUET but had not applied to the respective universities earlier ""may also be considered"".UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said: ""Seats remain vacant in some central universities even after three or four rounds of counselling. To keep the seats vacant for an entire academic year is not only a waste of resources but also results in denial of quality higher education to many students who aspire to pursue higher studies in central universities.""He added, ""Hence, in order to facilitate the universities to fill up their vacant seats, SOPs have been formulated. Students who appeared in CUET, but may or may not have applied to the respective university for the courses or programmes earlier may also be considered.""
