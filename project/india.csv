Unauthorised employment, unauthorised withdrawal from classes, expulsion and suspension, and failure to report optional practical training employment are some of the possible reasons which could lead to termination of a student's visa resulting in unlawful presence"" and eventual deportation,"" said Singh.","Canada accounted for the highest number of deaths at 172, followed by 108 in the US, 58 in the UK, 57 in Australia, and 37 in Russia. 18 incidents were reported in Ukraine, 24 in Germany, 12 each in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Cyprus.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112073467,imgsize-709788,width-400,resizemode-4/112073467.jpg"
Chasing highs that Everest can’t provide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chasing-highs-that-everest-cant-provide/articleshow/112073074.cms,"Expecting the unexpected

Covering every last detail

What do mountaineers do when they want to experience the feeling of being one with the trail? Simple: they go off it.“The popular and iconic mountains have an established route. With the required amount of fitness and endurance levels, one can make it to the summit. But mapping the unknown has a different thrill,” Satyarup Siddhanta sums it up perfectly.The climber from Bengal is the Guiness record holder for being the youngest in the world to complete seven summits and seven volcanic peaks.He is also one of a tribe of mountaineers from the state — many of whom have summited the world’s iconic mountains — that is now climbing unexplored, virgin peaks that pose unknown challenges and offer the thrill of scaling unconquered heights.There are now at least three teams of climbers from West Bengal that have completed treks in remote and uncharted areas in recent months. One of them, Sonarpur Arohi, last month summited Gupt Parvat, an unexplored peak in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas.“On such expeditions, there is no signposting. Most of these explorations lead to nowhere. What you achieve may not be that something that you’d looked forward to. Despite that, you try because an explorer takes the path less trodden,” Siddhanta explains the philosophy driving these mountaineers.Take the expedition to Shikar Beh, which Sonarpur Arohi attempted after Gupt Par vat. They failed to complete the trek as they hadn’t carried equipment needed to cross large crevices. “There was a climb to Shikar Beh in 1973 by a Japanese team. It never mentioned these crevices. Approaching the summit, our team was stopped by those crevices. We realised they were impossible to cross without a ladder,” he said.While planning the Gupt Parvat (5,988m) expedition, Sonarpur Arohi did not even have a picture of the peak. “It cannot be seen or identified unless you physically reach the mountain. The gorge was never explored. The villagers never went beyond the first transit camp,” said Rudra Prasad Haldar, a member of the team, which went to Mount Brammah in Kishtwar valley of Jammu and Kashmir last year via a new route.Haldar, an Everest summiteer, found the Gupt Parvat climb to be no less difficult than scaling the world’s highest peak. “There was no recorded attempt from the Indian side. After reaching the area we realised that the topography had changed completely over the decades. We had read that it was an ice field. But when we reached, we found it to be a moraine (mound of loose glacial sediments). In place of ice fields, we found multiple glacier lakes,” he recounted.Where written records are not available, explorers have to start preparations well in advance. “We started by studying satellite images of the area as well as topographic sheets. We realised that satellite images were not sufficient. We reached out to NATMO (National Atlas & Thematic Mapping Organisation) and the National Library for topographic sheets,” said Debashis Acharya, a mountaineer from south Bengal who made it to Jamdwar Khal (5,241m), an unexplored ridge between Har Ki Dun and Sian Gad at the eastern end of Uttarakhand’s Jamdwar glacier.Explorers know that when journeying into the unknown it is important to find out about emergency exit routes, too. “Since there was no record of any Jamdwar Khal exploration, we had to gather information about treks in the adjacent areas to map emergency exit routes,” Acharya said.Another team from Kolkata set out for Holmes’ Col (5,507m) in Himachal Pradesh last month. The hostile and tricky stretch was first recorded by Peter Holmes in 1956. “There might have been other ascents, but we could not find any account by other climbers,” said Abhijit Banik, a climber from Kolkata. “We had planned to make it to Holmes’ Col in 2021, but we had to call off the journey and return midway,” he added.“After we started from Barsheni in Himachal Pradesh, we set up our base camp at 4,891m on the Dibibokri main glacier. Debashis Bardhan, a member of the team, had laid out an initial plan based on Holmes’s account. But the topography has changed over the past seven decades. You can often go off the edge of the map,” he said. On the eighth day, a group of four finally managed to move towards Holmes’ Col. The weather was favourable and they reached the summit of Holmes’ Col on June 12.","There are now at least three teams of climbers from West Bengal that have completed treks in remote and uncharted areas in recent months.

"Long flying hours, roster instability causing pilot fatigue: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/long-flying-hours-roster-instability-causing-pilot-fatigue-study/articleshow/112072738.cms,"MUMBAI: Prolonged flying duties surpassing 10 hours per day, consecutive night shifts, rapidly rotating weekly rosters disrupting circadian rhythms , and schedules strictly adhering to the bare minimum mandated rest periods were identified as the primary factors contributing to pilot fatigue , according to the findings of a recent survey conducted by a non-governmental organisation.The survey, which garnered responses from 530 airline pilots in India, predominantly captains operating domestic and international flights lasting under six hours, revealed that approximately 70% of pilots considered flight duty periods exceeding 10 hours to have a profound impact on the onset of fatigue, as stated in the survey report published by Safety Matters Foundation . Currently, India allows airlines to schedule pilots for flight duty periods of up to 13 hours within a 24-hour timeframe.Exacerbating the issue of extended duty hours were frequent ""tail swaps,"" which 63% of pilots cited as a contributing factor to fatigue. Tail swaps , a term used in the airline industry, refer to a change of aircraft. However, the crew cannot directly transfer from one aircraft to another. ""The crew must disembark from the aircraft, proceed to the terminal building, and undergo security screening before boarding the next aircraft. Frequent tail swaps, when combined with other factors such as maximum flight duty, minimum rest, and multiple landings, can compound the increase of fatigue,"" the survey stated.""The survey findings and recommendations were submitted to DGCA last week,"" stated Capt Amit Singh of Safety Matters Foundation.In addition to answering survey questions, 177 pilots provided comments that shed light on the work-life balance of pilots in India. Roster instability emerged as the primary grievance in the comments.One captain shared an example where his airline woke him up at 2:30 am to inform him not to report for duty at 5 am as scheduled, as it would violate the minimum mandated rest period. Other complaints included excessive layovers, with pilots returning home for just one day after working layover flights for 6-7 days, as the pilot's base station no longer holds significance.Another pilot highlighted an increase in errors during landings and take-offs among crew members due to fatigue, and airlines not granting leave, among other issues.""In recent years, the number of Indian pilots who have been declared temporarily or permanently medically unfit has risen,"" noted Capt Singh, emphasising that fatigue is a significant contributory factor to cardiac disease .In August of the previous year, a 40-year-old IndiGo pilot suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away in the security hold area of Nagpur airport, just minutes before he was scheduled to operate a flight to Pune.This incident brought to light a range of fatigue-related issues afflicting airline pilots and prompted the regulator to review the norms governing maximum permissible duty periods & minimum rest periods when rostering pilots for flying duties.In Jan this year, DGCA had issued a reformed set of norms with a strict June 1 deadline for airlines to implement. However, in March, following representations made by airlines to the ministry, DGCA withdrew the deadline.","A recent survey conducted by a non-governmental organisation identified the primary factors contributing to pilot fatigue.

Study links drop in vulture tally to rise in human deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-links-drop-in-vulture-tally-to-rise-in-human-deaths/articleshow/112072735.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ghazipur landfill site in Delhi may be one of the few places in the capital where one can still spot the vultures - a bird species that used to be a common sight in India until 1990s and have since witnessed a fast decline. From a 50 million strong population, the bird species have turned into one of the most critically endangered species in the country today.While loss of vultures has been noted with concern and efforts are being made to revive their population, a new study has - for the first time - highlighted how the rapid drop in numbers of this bird species coincided with excess human deaths in the country.Districts affected by the disappearance of vultures saw an increase in human all-cause death rates of at least 4%, averaged over 2000 to 2005, a study published in the journal American Economic Association (AEA) suggests.While some animal species will feed on carrion if available, for vultures, it is the only source of food.As a result, vultures are considered very efficient scavengers . Also, unlike the other scavenging species such as dogs and rats, vultures do not leave the flesh behind and reduce the risk of transmission of diseases from them.The American Economic Association study states that anecdotal accounts describe how with vultures no longer available, the rotting meat and its scent build up, attracting feral or stray dogs. ""Combination of dogs and rats serving as vectors of infectious diseases, and being less efficient scavengers, make carcass dumps a breeding ground for disease,"" the study point out.Increase in population of rats and feral dogs causes rise in rabies, and in transmission of pathogens and diseases such as anthrax to other scavengers, as well as to increased water pollution from carcass dumping and surface runoff. All this led to additional human deaths, the AEA study suggests.","Vultures used to be a common sight in India until 1990s and have since witnessed a fast decline.

NEET-UG scam: Number of toppers set to drop from 61 to 17 in revised list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-scam-toppers-number-set-to-drop-from-61-to-17-in-revised-list/articleshow/112024237.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list , most likely on Friday.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi , working at Supreme Court's instance, recommended that only one of the options in a question in the physics paper was correct.Several students had complained that two of the four options could be held to be correct going by different NCERT books. With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"

"After Russia, PM Modi may visit Ukraine as West outrages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-russia-pm-modi-may-visit-ukraine-as-west-outrages/articleshow/112069643.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi may visit Kyiv next month in another balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, hoping it will calm frayed nerves in Washington and major European capitals which have been dismayed by the timing of his visit to Russia earlier this month. According to diplomatic sources, both sides are in talks to finalise a date for the visit in the last week of August.If it happens, it will be the first visit by an Indian PM to Ukraine.It will come in the middle of some serious strife, including the “tough conversations” that the US says it is having with India, over Modi’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin which coincided with the NATO summit in Washington and also the reported bombing of a children’s hospital in Kyiv by Russia. That Modi chose Russia for his first bilateral visit since the inauguration of his third term also fuelled the outrage.Government sources defended the talks for Modi’s visit saying it had been in the works for a while after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited the PM. Organising the visit will also be a logistical challenge, as a source said. Like other leaders who have visited Ukraine, Modi will probably have to undertake an overnight train journey from Poland to reach the Ukrainian capital. A few of the dates under discussion are close to August 24, Ukraine’s national day, and it remains to be seen if India will want the visit to coincide with that.Shortly after images of the Modi-Putin hug were beamed across the world, Zelenskyy had said that on a day Russia had bombed a children’s hospital, the embrace was not just a huge disappointment but also a devastating blow to peace efforts. India did express its displeasure to Ukraine over the remarks but without publicly saying so. Foreign minister S Jaishankar also spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba after Modi returned from Russia.Following the remarks by Zelenskyy, and with the US raising concerns even in the middle of the Russia visit, Modi had specifically raised the issue of violence against children with Putin the next morning.Apart from China, India remains the only major country to have not condemned Russia explicitly for its aggression against Ukraine. While India’s position on the war has been seen by many as pro-Russia neutrality, India has maintained since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022 that it wants to be able to reach out to both sides to emphasise the significance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving the conflict.India has so far avoided mediating itself between the 2 parties but has repeatedly said it will offer all possible support within its means for restoration of peace and emphasised the role of dialogue in reaching a peaceful settlement. India’s extremely nuanced approach was further highlighted at the recent Swiss peace summit in which, unlike China, it participated but didn’t endorse the outcome document because Russia wasn’t invited to the summit.For the US and others though, the timing of Modi’s visit seems to have acted as the straw that broke the camel’s back, with the Biden administration publicly ticking off India. While NSA Jake Sullivan reminded the Indian government Russia will always choose China over India, US ambassador Eric Garcetti said after Modi returned from his visit that India-US ties are not deep enough to be taken for granted by either side.","PM Narendra Modi may visit Kyiv next month in another balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

I would have completed all that I had to say, even if the seven minutes were allowed. But they rang the bell at five minutes, and I said, okay then I shall leave… and I left.”Expressing her disappointment, Banerjee said, “For them (those with the ruling side) it is 20 minutes, special package, special privilege, for the rest it is zero… that can never be virtuous. I did right by boycotting the meeting, I will never allow people of Bengal to be dishonoured, will never accept Bengal’s deprivation. We stand in solidarity with all parties who are running governments in different states and are being deprived by the Centre,” speaking to the media outside of the Niti Ayog, before leaving for Kolkata.Mentioning that she felt ""humiliated” at what happened, she said, ""If they understood their mistake, they would not have done this with me. This was a deliberate attempt to malign the Opposition.”“I have no issues if some states get a bigger share… but that cannot mean some states will get almost nothing… If you paralyse the states, the Centre will get paralysed in the coming days… the seriousness of this issue should be understood, I said and then I talked on how Bengal was being deprived.“I told them (at the meeting) that the Centre only gives instructions and puts up pictures, it is the job of states to do the work on the ground. You only gave instructions during the Covid-19 crisis and it was the states who handled everything.

It's unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true... She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” reacting Banerjee’s allegations.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and Tamil Nadu CM and DMK chief M K Stalin condemned the Centre for the “unacceptable” treatment for Banerjee.

PM targets opposition over Agniveer scheme





Opposition accuses PM Modi of 'petty politics'





NEW DELHI: On the Kargil Vijay Diwas, as opposition cornered PM Modi-led NDA government over the Agniveer scheme , the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states moved to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen. In back-to-back statements, the chief ministers of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha announced the decision to provide job reservations to Agniveers in the state jobs while backing the scheme.Underscoring the importance of national security, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath criticised the opposition on Friday for allegedly misleading the public regarding the Agniveer scheme.He also stated that his government will provide Agniveers jobs in police service and Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) on ""priority basis"".In a post on X, CM Yogi said, ""When Agniveers return after their service, Uttar Pradesh government will provide these youth the facility of adjustment in Police Service, PAC on priority basis. A certain reservation facility will be provided for them in Uttar Pradesh Police.""The announcement comes just days after the BJP-led Haryana government said the state would provide 10% reservation to Agniveers in direct recruitment to posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.Besides UP, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh also announced job quotas for Agniveers on Friday.Madhya Praadesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Friday announced that his government will provide reservations to Agniveers in the recruitment of police and armed forces after the end of their services.Sharing the information on social media platform X, Yadav said the decision is as per ""the wishes of our illustrious Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji.""The Madhya Pradesh CM earlier in the morning paid tribute to the heroes of the Kargil war at Shaurya Smarak in Bhopal on the occasion of 25th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.With this, Madhya Pradesh became the third BJP-led state to announce reservation in jobs for Agniveers.On the occasion of Kargil Diwas, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami also announced a similar decision.""We will make provisions and bring an Act to give reservation to them in government services. We are working on this plan. We will make use of their skills and discipline in various government departments,"" Dhami said.The chief minister also announced that the aid extended to the kin of martyrs will be increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.""No sacrifice can be bigger than the act of laying down one's life to secure the country's borders. No grant or honour can be enough for this supreme sacrifice,"" he added.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai also made the announcement saying, ""I am glad to announce that ex-Agniveers will be given priority in appointment of police constable, forest guard and jail guard in Chhattisgarh. The state government will soon release guidelines for it.""Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi announced similar move and said 10 per cent quota and five-year age relaxation will be given to the Agniveers in uniform services.Nayab Saini-led Haryana government had announced the similar move on July 17.Chief minister Nayab Saini said the state government will provide 10 percent reservation to Agniveers in Haryana in direct recruitment to the posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.He also announced age waiver of three years for Agniveers in Group B, C employment in the state.Earlier today, in his address at the Kargil Vijay Diwas Shradhanjali Samaroh in Drass, PM Modi called Agnipath scheme an example of necessary reforms done by the army.He said some people were playing politics over a sensitive issue related to national security and rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money. ""The aim of Agnipath is to make the forces young ... The aim of Agnipath is to keep the armies continuously fit for war,"" he said.""For decades, there have been discussions on making the armed forces young, from Parliament to various committees. The average age of Indian soldiers being higher than the global average has been raising concerns. Therefore, this topic was raised in many committees for years. But the will to solve this challenge related to the country's security was not shown earlier,"" PM Modi said.""Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. Some people are playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army,"" the PM added.Modi government's Agniveer scheme has attracted constant criticism by the opposition making it one of the major flashpoint during Lok Sabha election campaign and subsequent Parliament sessions.As PM Modi on Friday blamed the opposition for ""playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army"" over the scheme, the INDIA bloc leaders launched a counter-attack, accusing PM Modi of being involved in ""petty politics"".Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and other party leaders accused the prime minister of indulging in ""petty politics"" over the Agnipath issue and said the prime minister's remarks that his government implemented the scheme at the behest of the Army was a ""blatant lie"".""It is very unfortunate and deplorable that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is doing petty politics even on occasions like paying tribute to martyrs on Kargil Vijay Diwas. No Prime Minister has ever done this before,"" Kharge said.""Modi ji is saying that his government implemented the Agnipath scheme at the behest of the Army. This is a blatant lie and an unforgivable insult to our valiant armed forces. Modi ji, it is you who is spreading lies!"" he said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of ""lying"" even on Kargil Vijay Diwas.""He (Modi) says the Agnipath/Agniveer scheme was introduced by the Army. General MM Naravane, who was Army chief at that time, has written that the scheme came as a complete surprise to the Army and as a 'bolt from the blue' to the Navy and Air Force. Modi is now trying to evade responsibility for this disastrous scheme,"" he said in a post on X.Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MP Mahua Maji said the scheme needs to be reviewed as it does not provide any social security to the Agniveers.""I salute the martyrs of Kargil. Whenever foreign nations have attacked us, our brave soldiers have sacrificed their lives,"" she said.""But there should be a review of the Agniveer scheme. We should think about the soldiers on whom the whole nation of 140 crore people relies. What would happen to them after four years when they become unemployed?"" the JMM MP posed.The Trinamool Congress' Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen dismissed the prime minister's remarks that the Agniveer scheme is intended to keep the force young.""The Army has always been young, perhaps the prime minister does not know... They get voluntary retirement while they are young. They serve the nation, we respect them,"" she said.""Being in the Army was a full-time job. But the Agnipath-Agniveer (scheme) ended that. We will keep protesting against the scheme,"" Sen said.","BJP-ruled states move to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen.

I'm just putting facts on the ground, no interpretations. It was a clear request from their side because normally we would have gone alphabetically, starting with Andhra Pradesh, then Arunachal Pradesh.

It goes from seven to six to five to four to three. At the end, it shows zero. Nothing else happened. Then she said she would have liked to speak for more time but chose not to. That was it.

I told them that the Centre only gives instructions, and it is the job of the states to carry out the work on the ground. You only gave instructions during the COVID-19 crisis, and it was the states that handled everything. I informed them that they have withheld Rs 1.72 lakh crore of our funds, and this amount is only going to increase this year,"" the West Bengal CM further said.This comes after Mamata alleged that her microphone was cut off after five minutes, while other chief ministers from NDA-ruled states were allowed to speak for longer durations.“This is insulting. I will not attend any further meetings,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo said.""I walked out of the meeting.

According to diplomatic sources, both sides are in talks to finalise a date for the visit in the last week of August.It will be the first visit by an Indian PM to Ukraine.It will come in the middle of serious strife, including the ""tough conversations"" that US says it is having with India over Modi's embrace of Vladimir Putin , which coincided with the Nato summit in Washington, and Russia's reported bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's choice of Russia for his first bilateral visit since the inauguration of his third term also fuelled the outrage.Govt sources said that a Ukraine visit had been in the works for a while after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited PM Modi.Organising the visit will also present a logistical challenge, a source said.Like others who have visited Ukraine, PM Modi will probably have to undertake an overnight train journey from Poland to Kyiv.A few of the dates under discussion are close to Aug 24, Ukraine's national day, and it remains to be seen if India will want the visit to coincide with that.Zelenskyy had termed PM Modi's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a huge disappointment and a devastating blow topeace efforts . India did express its displeasure to Ukraine over the remarks but without publicly saying so.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba after PM Modi returned from Russia.Following the remarks by Zelenskyy, and with the US raising concerns even in the middle of the Russia visit, PM Narendra Modi had specifically raised the issue of violence against children with Putin the next morning.Apart from China, India remains the only major country to have not condemned Russia explicitly for its aggression against Ukraine.While India's position on the war has been seen by many as 'pro-Russia neutrality', India has maintained that it wants to be able to reach out to both sides to emphasise the significance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving the conflict.",PM Modi may visit Kyiv next month in another balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Commenting on the issue, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Haridwar, Pramendra Dobhal, said on Saturday, ""The matter has come to our knowledge through social media.An investigation into it at the level of SP city is under way. Further action in the matter will be based on the outcome of the investigation.""A spot visit by TOI to Jwalapur - the minority-dominated area where the screens were put up on July 22 and subsequently removed on Friday after the issue gained traction on social media - revealed that there was raging discussion amongst locals on the issue. ""Instead of saying that covering the religious places was part of the administration's strategy to maintain peace during the kanwar yatra, district administration and police officials chose to deny any role in the move,which makes it suspicious,"" said Ankit Verma, a local CA.Anwar Ali, caretaker of the Islamiya mosque, which was 'covered', said, ""Neither the district administration nor police consulted or informed us before installing screens in front of the mosque."" He added that ""some police personnel who were not from the local police station as we knew most of the local cops, came in the night a few days ago and asked us to provide support in putting up the screens."" ""Next morning, we saw labourers erecting the screens in front of the mosque. There was nothing much we could do about it,"" he added.Bhure Shah mazar's caretaker (gaddi nasheen) Shakeel Ahmed, voicing similar sentiments, said, ""We do not know why and when the screen was put up at our mazar, nor do we know why it was removed. In the last 40 years since I have been here, no such thing has ever been done.""One of the officers of the state police said that the ""instruction to cover the religious structures was most likely a verbal one, considering matters related to the kanwar yatra are being heard in court"". He added, ""We have been directed not to speak too much about the matter."" Haridwar district magistrate, Dheeraj Gabryal, had said on Friday, ""There was no instruction passed by the district administration to cover any religious sites falling on the route of kanwar yatra.""After the issue gained prominence, senior cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj, who holds the tourism, culture and PWD portfolio, said on Friday that ""this has been done so that there is no unnecessary excitement or provocation from any side and the yatra runs smoothly.""Meanwhile, local BJP leaders were planning to raise the issue before chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami who was expected to visit Haridwar in a day or two.

They also have a slightly elongated tail and spots on them. Hence, people could easily confuse them for a dog. There were no signs of dog meat in the samples. Due to short supply of mutton and 'chevon', some traders source it from other states and sell it here at an affordable price,"" he added.As the meat packages arrived, questions were raised as to why any trader would bring such a huge quantity of 'chevon' to Bengaluru when there was so much availability of sheep and goat in Karnataka. However, much to the dismay of many, experts from the department of animal sciences at Gandhi Krishi Vigyan Kendra (GKVK) revealed there was severe scarcity of 'chevon' in Bengaluru.Prof B L Chidananda, former professor of animal sciences at GKVK, said: ""Unlike the popular sheep varieties, Karnataka does not have its own varieties of goat. Due to this, there is a shortfall of 25% to 30% of 'chevon' in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka. At the same time, Bengaluru, along with other districts of Karnataka, is the largest consumer of meat. Bridging this gap and keeping in mind the price affordability, traders source cheap varieties of chevon from other states where there is largescale production.""","Police seized 90 insulated boxes with 2,700kg of meat that had arrived by train from Jaipur. Tension prevailed at the station and adjoining areas on Friday evening when activists gathered in large numbers to protest the alleged transportation of dog meat. Police registered three FIRs on Friday night over the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112071650,imgsize-1467567,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112071650.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Urging states to provide an investor-friendly environment, PM Modi on Saturday asked govt think tank NITI Aayog to prepare an "" investment-friendly charter "" of parameters which would include policies, programmes and processes for attracting investments. Modi said states may be monitored on these parameters to promote healthy competition among them for attracting investments.Speaking at the 9th governing council meeting of NITI Aayog, he underscored the importance of law and order, good governance and infrastructure as vital for attracting investments, rather than just incentives.Twenty states and six UTs attended the meet; some opposition-governed states opted out.""Viksit Bharat in 2047 is an ambition of every Indian. States can play an active role to achieve this aim as they are directly connected with the people,"" he said, asserting that the aspiration should reach each district, block, and village.PM Modi said the dream of Viksit Bharat can be realised only if the states also develop, and exhorted them to prepare a vision for 2047 for themselves and their districts.This was the first meeting of the reconstituted council and the PM expressed confidence that India is progressing on the path to fulfil the vision of a developed nation in 2047 through the power of cooperative federalism.Continuing the govt's focus on jobs, the PM emphasised skilling and training of youth to make them employment-ready as the world looks favourably towards India for skilled human resources. ""India is a youthful country. It is a huge attraction for the entire world because of its workforce. We should aim to make our youth a skilled and employable workforce. Emphasis on skill, research, innovation and job-based knowledge is necessary for making Viksit Bharat @2047,"" the PM was quoted as saying.Modi said that this is the decade of change which brings a lot of opportunities across sectors and encouraged states to utilise them and make policies and initiate governance programmes that are conducive for development through innovative approaches in policy-making and execution.The PM urged states to explore the creation of river grids at the state level for effective utilisation of water resources and said that zero poverty must be set as a target on a priority to realise the goal of a developed nation. He emphasised the need to tackle poverty on an individual basis rather than just at a programme level and said removing poverty from the grassroots would bring about a transformational effect in the country.The PM also encouraged all states to increase productivity and diversification in agriculture and provide market linkages to farmers. He called for spreading the adoption of natural farming practices which can improve soil fertility, ensure better and quicker returns to farmers due to low costs, and also provide a global market for the products.He also urged states to initiate demographic management plans to address the issues of population ageing in future and said states should aim to take up capacity building of govt officials at all levels and encouraged them to collaborate with the Capacity Building Commission.Modi lauded the Aspirational Districts Programme anchored by Niti Aayog, and said that the key to its success was continuous and online monitoring of measurable parameters, which led to healthy competition among districts to better their performance in different govt schemes.Chief ministers and Lt Governors gave various suggestions for the vision of Viksit Bharat @ 2047 and also discussed steps being taken in their states. Some of the key suggestions and best practices highlighted were related to agriculture, education and skill development, entrepreneurship, drinking water, reducing compliances, governance, digitalisation, women empowerment, and cyber security, among others, an official statement said.The PM asked Niti Aayog to study suggestions of states and UTs made during the meeting.",PM Modi said the dream of Viksit Bharat can be realised only if the states also develop.

I was not allowed even (those) seven minutes. I would have completed all that I had to say, even if the seven minutes were allowed. But they rang the bell at five minutes, and I said, okay then I shall leave... and I left.""""I was the only one (from opposition-governed states) present there; they should have allotted at least half-an-hour for me... and I am not an irresponsible person that I will not maintain my time,"" she added.She further said, ""Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh CM) presented his views for 20 minutes and CMs of Assam, Arunachal, Chhattisgarh and Goa also presented their views for 15, 16, 17, 20 minutes. But I spoke only for five minutes, and people started interrupting me by ringing the bell. I said, okay, you don't want to listen to Bengal, and I boycotted the meeting and left.""While government and Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam rebutted Mamata's charge, other INDIA bloc opposition parties that had boycotted the meeting rallied around her. CMs from states governed by DMK, Congress and AAP were among those who skipped the meeting to protest what they have called Centre 's ""discrimination"" in budgetary allocations toward their states.Dismissing Mamata's claim, Sitharaman said, ""CM Mamata Banerjee attended the Niti Aayog meeting. We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time, and that was displayed on the screen present before every table... She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false. Every CM was given their due time to speak. It's unfortunate that the CM of West Bengal has claimed that her microphone was switched off, which is not true... She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood.""Subrahmanyam said the West Bengal CM's request to speak before lunch was accepted, though her turn would have come in the afternoon, going in alphabetical order of the states. He added that when her time was up, defence minister Rajnath Singh just tapped the mic, and she stopped speaking and walked out. However, officials of West Bengal government continued to attend the meeting, he added.Mentioning that she felt ""humiliated"" at what had happened, Mamata said, ""I have no issues if some states get a bigger share... but that cannot mean some states get almost nothing... If you paralyse the states, Centre will get paralysed in the coming days.""Congress' Jairam Ramesh and TN CM M K Stalin condemned Centre over the ""treatment"" meted out to Mamata, calling it ""unacceptable.""""Its (Niti Aayog) functioning has been blatantly partisan... It muzzles all divergent and dissenting viewpoints, which are the very essence of an open democracy... Its treatment of the West Bengal CM today, although typical of the Niti Aayog, is unacceptable,"" Ramesh posted on X.Stalin's said on X: ""Is this #CooperativeFederalism? Is this the way to treat a chief minister ? The Union BJP government must understand that opposition parties are an integral part of our democracy and should not be treated as enemies to be silenced.
