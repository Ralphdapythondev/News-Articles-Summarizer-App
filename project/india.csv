Earth gets a ‘mini moon’ for 2 months and it has a Mahabharata connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/earth-gets-a-mini-moon-for-2-months-and-it-has-a-mahabharata-connection/articleshow/113791435.cms,"An illustration for visual representation of asteroid trajectory

This ‘mini-moon’ is actually an asteroid — named ‘2024 PT5’ — which is about the size of a school bus. When it whizzed past Earth on Sunday (Sept 29), it would be temporarily pulled by our planet’s gravity. However, the Earth’s double delight of possessing two ‘Moons’ will be short-lived as the asteroid will revolve around the Earth only for 57 days.The asteroid will jettison the Earth’s gravity and disappear into deep space by late November.The ‘2024 PT 5’ was discovered on August 7, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), an automated system funded by the US space agency Nasa and run from Hawaii. The system is used to monitor near-Earth asteroids.In a report published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS), astronomers say the orbital properties of 2024 PT5 resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt, ‘a sparsely resonant population of small Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).’Dr Anil Kumar, head of Isro's Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA), which is also keeping a close watch on the asteroid, has also confirmed that the ‘ mini moon ’ is part of the Arjuna Asteroid grouping. The grouping was named in honour of Arjuna, a central character in epic Mahabharata, who was known for his archery skills and bravery. Like the swift arrows of Arjuna, the name reflects both the asteroid’s swift movement through the solar system and its unpredictable nature.The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km, making it too small to detect without specialised equipment.Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos, two scientists who reported it, said, “NEOs that follow horseshoe paths, and approach our planet at close range and low relative velocity, may undergo mini-moon events in which their geocentric energy becomes negative for hours, days or months, but without completing one revolution around Earth"".Marcos said this is not the first time mini Moons appear around the Earth. It happened in 1997, 2013 and 2018, a report said.On Nov 25, asteroid ‘2024 PT5’ will part ways with the Earth and continue its solo trajectory in cosmos. It's expected to pass by Earth again in 2055.","The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km.

'Bihar is ready for change'

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , who is all set to launch his political party in Bihar, on Tuesday claimed that state chief minister Nitish Kumar was not ""physically and mentally"" fit and accused the BJP of propping him up to run its government at the Centre. The political strategist-turned-politician, in an interview to news agency PTI, said his assessment of Nitish Kumar's health is based on the chief minister's relative absence from public life and his silence on host of burning issues - be it floods or the row over land survey and installation of smart meter.""A big section in Bihar is wondering if Nitish Kumar is mentally and physically fit to provide leadership to Bihar,"" Kishor said when asked to explain his contention that Bihar's longest-serving chief minister is not in a physically and mentally fit condition.Kishor claimed that everyone knows that Nitish Kumar is in last phase of his politics and that polls cannot be won in his name. ""Even his supporters know that in his current physical, mental and political state, he is in no way in a condition to run a state like Bihar,"" he said. ""People of Bihar had given a similar message in the 2020 elections when the JD(U) could win only 42 seats, falling way behind the BJP's 74 and the main opposition party RJD's 75,"" he added. Kishor had earlier alleged that Nitish Kumar had handed over the entire administration to 2-4 of his advisers and there was ""jungle raaj"" of officers in the state.Ironically, at one time Prashant Kihsor had helped Nitish Kumar led Mahagathbandhan win the 2015 Bihar assembly election. Kishor had later joined the Janata Dal (United) in September 2018 as vice-president of the party. However, this bonhomie was short lived.Prashant Kishor, whose Jan Suraaj campaign is taking the shape of a new party, alleged that the BJP has made Bihar suffer for its political compulsions and benefits and the people of the state will punish the saffron party for this.Also Read:""It is the BJP's compulsion that it has to retain Nitish Kumar in power in Bihar for running its government in Delhi, Kishor said and added ""The BJP knows that its alliance will lose if he remains at the helm, but to keep him is the political compulsion of the party.""""Results will reflect it. The BJP will be punished for its doings. The Congress helped Lalu Prasad run a 'jungle raaj' for 15 years. People of Bihar completely uprooted the Congress. The BJP will suffer the same fate,"" Kishor said.Taking a swipe at the BJP, he said that the saffron party breaks up other parties across the country by hook or by crook but has chosen to ""impose"" Kumar on Bihar despite having many more seats in the assembly due to its need for JD(U) MPs.Prashant Kishor, who has toured the state for almost two years, is confident that people will give his party an absolute majority in the 243-member assembly when elections are held next year.Read also:""People voted for either of the two main alliances in Bihar due to a lack of alternative. They will shake off the two rival alliances, which have kept the state most poor and backward for over 30 years,"" Kishor said.""People will rise above caste, religion and mandir-masjid issue to vote solely for the future of their children's education and employment, and Jan Suraaj will be that instrument of change,"" he claimed.Asked if he will contest the election or be the chief ministerial face of the party, Kishor said it is for its leaders to decide.(With inputs from agencies)","Prashant Kishor claims Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is not ""physically and mentally"" fit.

NEW DELHI: Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has been given 20-day parole ahead of the Haryana Assembly polls.Haryana authorities have granted 20-day parole to Ram Rahim Singh, official sources told news agency PTI on Tuesday.This comes a day after Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Haryana made it clear that the state government may consider Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's request for a temporary release from jail on emergency parole.""After receiving a report from the state authorities, I have recommended that the department may consider him for release subject to the correctness of the circumstances he (Dera Chief) has mentioned in his request for emergency parole and on imposition of conditions for such release,"" Pankaj Aggarwal , CEO Haryana told TOI.Earlier, the Haryana Congress wrote to the Election Commission of India (ECI) against Ram Rahim's temporary parole, expressing apprehension that he may influence the Haryana voters.On Saturday, the CEO had asked the authorities to explain the ""compelling"" circumstances under which the temporary release of the DSS chief for 20 days is needed.The explanation was sought by the CEO after jail authorities in Haryana had sought CEO's approval in view of imposition ofmodel code of conduct due to state assembly polls scheduled to be held on October 5.In March this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the Haryana government ""not to consider"" any application for parole by Ram Rahim ""without permission of this court"".In August this year, Singh was granted a 21-day furlough.At that time, Singh, who is lodged in Rohtak's Sunaria jail, during his temporary release period, had sought to stay at the Dera ashram in Barnawa in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat.Notably, in the past some of his paroles and furloughs have coincided with polls in Punjab and Haryana and neighbouring states. He was granted three weeks' furlough from February 7, 2022, barely two weeks before the Punjab Assembly polls.Singh was sentenced in 2017 and is serving a 20-year sentence for raping two of his disciples.

Muda agrees to take back plots allotted to Siddaramaiah's wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muda-agrees-to-take-back-plots-allotted-to-siddaramaiahs-wife/articleshow/113857209.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) on Tuesday decided to take back the 14 plots alloted to Karnatak CM Siddaramaiah 's wife Parvathi B M . The Muda has also ordered to cancel the sale deed of these plots.""Smt. Parvathi's son Dr Yathindra, a MLC, had submitted a letter....we have gone through the provisions in our act. There are provisions in our act to take it when given (back) voluntarily,"" Muda commissioner A N Raghunandan said.""After consulting panel advocates and the legal officer, and after determining that everything is correct, we arrived at a conclusion.So, we have ordered to take it back.

India will be most rapidly growing economy: Professor Larry Summers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-will-be-the-most-rapidly-growing-economy-professor-larry-summers/articleshow/113825176.cms,"Photo/ANI

Larry Summers

, the Charles W Eliot University professor and president emeritus at

Harvard University

, believes that India is poised to be the fastest growing in the coming years, with the Modi govt laying the foundation. The former US treasury secretary, however, underlines the need to push ahead with reforms and suggests that India focuses on creating more jobs in services and construction.

China is seen as the big threat and the over-capacity impacting the global

economy

.

There are import restrictions on Chinese products due to strategic considerations, but it also means higher cost for consumers. Is there a need to strike a balance?

Do you see India ready to take advantage of the situation? How do you see the Indian economy playing out in the next five-seven years?

What are the big challenges?

Do you see generating jobs as a big challenge?

You and NK Singh had presented the reform roadmap for MDBs. How do you see the progress?

Is it time to undertake a similar exercise for the IMF?

Excerpts:China’s economic problems go back to the suppression of consumption. The US typically spends around 70% of GDP in household consumption and even during the second world war that number was close to 50%. China’s consumption has run somewhere in the less than 40% range. That means there is a large amount of resources that has to be devoted to something else. At some points that has been infrastructure but after laying more concrete in five years than the US did during the 20th century, infrastructure has run into diminishing returns.There is now clear overhang of residential real estate. China has been investing heavily in capacity for exports, often subsidized capacity, with very problematic implications for the rest of the world. This is an issue that is best addressed multilaterally by many countries rather than countries acting individually, but it needs to be addressed. Ultimately, I don’t see a way forward for the global economy that does not involve a more balanced Chinese economy with a substantially greater commitment to consumption-led growth. I am encouraged a bit by the steps that were taken but how forceful and effective those steps would be remains to be seen.It is very important, particularly when inflation has been a concern, to be very mindful of self-administered supply shocks. It is important that we avoid single points of dependence for key inputs. It is important that we are not overly vulnerable to China for technologies that are for our national defence. But it is also important that we minimise the cost of inputs that producers use, because it holds down prices and reduces inflation and makes our producers more competitive.The proposal for across-the-board large tariffs against China are almost completely misguided. The right policy involves finding a balance and confining protection to cases where it is motivated by resilience, national security, countervailing large subsidies. Simply seeking to protect because China has achieved a very high level of competitiveness is a strategy that is likely to boomerang in terms of the Chinese response and is likely to have adverse effects for inflation and purchasing power of working people.I am optimistic about India’s prospects to increase its GDP six-fold by the century of Independence and be the most rapidly growing economy in the world over the next five years, the next decade and the next generation among major economies. Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has been spectacularly successful as an energizer, putting in place infrastructure, establishing new initiatives in physical infrastructure and in intangible spheres involving payments or individual identities. I hope that in the years ahead, reform to assure strong and diverse incentives for initiatives allowing market forces to play can run strongly in the way that providing energy to broad public efforts has so far. It is in that way that the promise of the Indian economy best be realized.The geopolitics are substantial challenge. As there is an increasing axis between China, Russia and Iran, India will have to maneuver with great skill as its cooperates and seeks a more cooperative relationship with the US. India will have to work very hard in the age of AI to maintain its very strong presence in IT and all things digital. I also hope that India can continue the process where so much progress has been made of trying outwards and towards the world. The truth is that for most of the last 70 years the greatest barriers to India benefiting from globalization have been those put in place by the Indian govt and there is progress there, but there is still more room to grow in terms of reducing barriers.It is already a substantial challenge and is likely to be an increasing challenge. There is certainly a role to play in industry and manufacturing. My suspicion is that if India is ultimately successful, it will have a great deal to do with creating jobs in the service sector at a time when the service sector becomes much more expandable globally due to IT and also creating jobs in construction at a time when there is a great deal in India that needs to be built.The good news is I have welcomed the enthusiasm in the World Bank and other banks for accepting many of our recommendations and that is gratifying. On the other hand, the rubber meets the road in terms of resource mobilization and implementation, there it is less clear that the kind of transformative change to which Mr NK Singh and I aspired is yet in train. We will be watching very closely and offering our views in a candid and constructive way.Yes, the so-called resilience trust fund that was enacted after Covid moved only small amounts of resources to the developing world. There needs to be exploration of new facilities to support transformation to a green economy in some ways reminiscent of a system transformation facility that was enacted after the Berlin Wall fell when in a rather different way there were a set of economies that needed longer term support for structural transformation.There has been great emphasis on how volumes of lending from the World Bank can be increased within its current financial structure but rather less attention to those questions where the IMF is concerned. I am struck that no one was worried that the IMF was under-reserved when the value of its gold stock was half of what it was today. The financial capacity of the IMF can be substantially enhanced. It is important to insulate economies from external shocks and the type of facility IMF implanted during the oil shock period, where with low conditionality simply being in good standing, countries had ability to rapidly access financing if they suffered an important external shock from a change in interest rate environment or a change in the commodity price environment. It would be worth close examination at this moment.",Larry Summers believes that India is poised to be the fastest growing in the coming years. The former US treasury secretary underlines the need to push ahead with reforms. He suggests that India focuses on creating more jobs in services and construction.

"This winter may be harsh in North India due to La Nina conditions, indicates IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-winter-may-be-harsh-in-north-india-due-to-la-nina-conditions-predicts-imd/articleshow/113863095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Summer monsoon, which ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall, is likely to fully withdraw from the country by mid-October and the winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula, the IMD said on Tuesday. It also hinted at the possibility of a harsh winter in north India, specially northwest India, including Delhi-NCR and adjoining central region, as La Nina conditions are expected to form during Oct-Nov.La Nina is a climate phenomena associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Though it is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent, it remained absent during the southwest (summer) monsoon months despite forecasts by different global models.""There is a 71% chance that La Nina conditions will develop during Oct-Nov... The years when you have La Nina, temperatures in the northern part of the country, specially northwest India and adjoining central region, are below normal (colder than normal)... So, you can have cold wave conditions during winter months,"" said IMD chief, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.He, however, underlined that its severity would be known only later as the La Nina condition is still weak and the Met department will have to monitor how much it will be strengthened in January or February. The IMD will follow it up and will be able to come out with a more precise forecast only in November.Good rainfall this year, however, was mainly due to other factors including six depressions, 14 'low pressure systems' in Bay of Bengal and one cyclonic storm 'Asna' in the Arabian Sea.Overall the ‘above normal’ rainfall during the season not only helped increase the acreage of the kharif (summer sown) crops beyond ‘normal’ (average of last five years) sown area, bringing hope of good crop output, but also filled reservoirs that take care of irrigation needs of rabi (winter sown) crops and hydro-power generation.Region-wise performance of the summer monsoon that technically ended on Monday showed a very unique feature of regional variation in rainfall this year with arid west Rajasthan receiving excess rainfall to the extent of 71% more showers than what it normally gets. Similarly, west Gujarat too received 75% more than its normal rainfall during the season.Mohapatra attributed ‘large excess’ rainfall in west Rajasthan and west Gujarat to formation of more numbers of ‘low pressure systems’ and ‘depressions’ that this year extended as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. He also noted how the monsoon trough remained south of its normal position, bringing ‘large excess’ rains in both these meteorological subdivisions, covering 9% of the total area of the country.Out of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions in the country, two subdivisions received large excess rainfall, 10 subdivisions constituting 26% of the total area received excess, 21 subdivisions received normal rainfall (54% of the total area) and three subdivisions (Arunachal Pradesh, Punjab, J & K and Ladak) constituting 11% of the total area received deficient season rainfall.Data shows that Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh each received 28% less than normal rainfall whereas J&K and Ladakh got 26% deficit rainfall.",Summer monsoon ended on Monday in the 'above normal' category after recording nearly 8% higher than normal rainfall. The winter monsoon will set in around the same time (by Oct 17) in the southeast peninsula.

Besides, he is barred from any election-related activity.Ram Rahim had applied for the parole on Saturday, within a month of returning to Rohtak jail after completion of his previous furlough.Haryana's chief electoral officer (CEO) sought an explanation from the state govt on Sunday on the ""compelling circumstances"" for granting parole when the model code of conduct was in force. On Monday, the CEO said the state govt is at liberty to take a call on this matter.After getting Haryana chief secretary's clearance on Tuesday, additional chief secretary (home) Anurag Rastogi sent the parole-related file to DGP (prisons) Muhammad Akil for action, sources said.

The commerce department recently expanded the import monitoring system for laptops and computers until Dec and may come back with a mandate to impose curbs later, sources indicated.The idea is to keep a close tab on devices that are part of Internet of Things , which are connected and there are fears that data may be accessible to firms and agencies across India's northern borders.As a result, checks on cameras, which now require mandatory certification by designated labs, came after gaps were noticed in the security framework in surveillance cameras.

NEW DELHI: Ladakh-based climate activist and education reformer Sonam Wangchuk and over 170 people, who were on way to the national capital as part of their Delhi Chalo Padyatra demanding sixth schedule status for the UT, were detained by Delhi Police at the Singhu border on Monday night for allegedly ""violating prohibitory orders"".Wangchuk and 173 detainees, who are housed in police stations in Bawana, Narela and Kanjhawala, began an indefinite hunger strike in protest against their detention.Delhi CM Atishi was not allowed to meet Wangchuk when she visited Bawana police station.I am sure the LG called the police officers and ordered them not to let me meet Wangchuk,” CM Atishi said. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, former deputy CM Manish Sisodia and leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi criticised the detentions. The police action led to a wave of protests.The climate activist started his march from Leh on Sept 1 to advocate for the inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to secure special protection for tribal regions. “I am being detained, along with 150 padyatris, at the Delhi border by a police force of hundreds, some say a thousand. Many elderly men and women in their 80s and a few dozen Army veterans. Our fate is unknown. We were on a most peaceful march to Bapu’s samadhi in the largest democracy in the world, the mother of democracy. Hai Ram!” Wangchuk had posted on Monday.Delhi Police will take a call on releasing Wangchuk and his supporters. They are being requested not to enter Delhi in large numbers as section 163 BNS (formerly section 144) is in place in the city.One of the detainees at Arya Samaj Ashram in Narela, where 23 women and seven men have been lodged, said they are on a peaceful march and yet they are being held like criminals. “I joined this march from Solang Valley. We did not face any problems anywhere as such. We even kept in mind that we should not disturb Haryana during this election time and bypassed it. But look what is happening. This is dictatorship. Our people have been divided. Some have been kept here, while we don’t know where the others are. We won’t eat now. We didn’t come this far to eat,” she said.Dr Jyoti, a doctor who visited the Bawana police station, said, “All of them, including Wangchuk, are not eating anything. They were facing some issues for which I prescribed medicines.”Another detainee, Sajjad Kargili, a political activist, said, “We, including some elected members of Ladakh, were detained around 9.30pm on Monday. This is extremely shameful and undemocratic. It is deeply unfortunate that while people like Ram Rahim are granted parole, the peaceful people of Ladakh are denied entry into Delhi.”Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa Jan said he was only allowed to meet Wangchuk for 5 minutes at 3 am. “There are so many problems in Ladakh after it became a Union territory. There is no cultural identity left and youth is troubled. They have been sitting on a fast for years now. Wangchuk was supporting these issues and leading the padyatra. They completed over 700 km to reach the Delhi border. But the action taken is a way to silence these voices,” he said.While the atmosphere inside the police stations was tense, the situation outside was equally grim. A crowd of supporters gathered, awaiting news of Wangchuk’s release. Among them was a 50-year-old woman from Gurgaon, a former student of Wangchuk who had participated in a ‘Sun and Earth’ festival he organised in Ladakh. “He always made an effort to connect with each student during the programme. We stand by the truth. We tried to meet him, but access has been denied. Wangchuk’s demands are entirely justified. Granting Ladakh the Sixth Schedule will not only benefit the region but the entire nation. The Himalayas are crucial for all of India,” she said.AAP workers rallied outside the Bawana police station, calling the LG “a dictator”. National Alliance of People's Movements also condemned the detentions during a press conference attended by environmentalist Prafulla Samantara, climate expert Soumya Dutta, Suniti SR, and social activist Medha Patkar.

LAC situation 'stable but sensitive': General Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-situation-stable-but-sensitive-general-upendra-dwivedi/articleshow/113862239.cms,"'Trust has become the biggest casualty'

NEW DELHI: The situation along the Line of Actual Control is “stable but sensitive and not normal”, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday, while stressing the armed forces “are operationally fully prepared to deal with any contingency” till China restores the status quo in eastern Ladakh as it existed before April 2020.“With China, you have to compete, you have to cooperate, you have to co-exist, you have to confront and contest,” Gen Dwivedi said.He also warned that India has to guard against the possibility that China was replicating its “grey zone warfare” tactics, underway in the South China Sea to lay claim to territory, along the 3,488-km LAC as well by relentlessly building and populating dual-use border villages there.In a candid fireside chat during a curtain raiser for the Chanakya defence dialogue, the Army chief said “trust has become the biggest casualty” in the continuing military confrontation with China after the People’s Liberation Army’s multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.While “positive signalling” has come out from the flurry of political-diplomatic meetings over the last two months, the execution of any plan depends on the military commanders on the ground, he said, adopting a cautious approach.“What we have to understand is that the diplomatic side gives options and possibilities. But when it comes to the execution on ground, it is dependent on the military commanders on both sides to take those decisions,” he said.China has so far rebuffed India’s push for the sequential process of first disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok, followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of its over 50,000 troops from the frontier in eastern Ladakh. It also upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) as well, with another 90,000 soldiers deployed there.In the chat, Gen Dwivedi said, “We want the situation that existed pre-April 2020 to be restored, whether in terms of ground occupation situation, the buffer zones that have been created (after disengagement at other face-off sites) or the patrolling that has been planned.”“So, till the time that situation is restored, the situation will remain sensitive and we are operationally fully prepared to face any kind of contingency that will come,” he added.The Army chief said the “low-hanging fruits” -- the face-offs at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso-Kailash Range and Gogra-Hot Springs -- had been resolved through a series of diplomatic and military talks.“Now, when it comes to the difficult ones (Depsang and Demchok), where we have different perceptions, both sides need to have a win-win situation. So, some kind of indications have been given from both the diplomatic sides,” he said.“Now, the military side will sit together and see how this can be translated on the ground. Everything we can think of is on the table along the northern front, and it includes Depsang and Demchok,” he added.As reported by TOI earlier, China has also been steadily building and populating as many as 628 dual-use `Xiaokang’ border villages along the disputed stretches of the LAC, especially in the eastern sector, to reinforce PLA positions as well as lay claim to territory.Asked about this, Gen Dwivedi said China was carrying out “artificial immigration and artificial settlements” through these border villages since there were no Chinese or Tibetan populations close to the LAC in most places. “In grey zone tactics, the causation may look very simple, but it may have a grandiose design behind it. That’s what we need to look into,” he said.“Do we call Doklam a war? Do we call Kargil a full-fledged war? Do we call Galwan a war? The answer is no. So all these are basically part of the grey zone battle. So, we need to be prepared for it,” he added","The situation along the Line of Actual Control is “stable but sensitive and not normal”, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said. He warned that India has to guard against the possibility that China was replicating its “grey zone warfare” tactics along the LAC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113862245,imgsize-1483359,width-400,resizemode-4/113862245.jpg"

"7 years after FIR, CBI closes case against NDTV ex-promoters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-after-fir-cbi-closes-case-against-ndtv-ex-promoters/articleshow/113862216.cms,"NEW DELHI: CBI on Tuesday submitted a closure report in a Delhi court in a case alleging cheating against former NDTV promoters and directors Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy.The report cited ""insufficient legally admissible evidence"" regarding Rs 48 crore loss suffered by ICICI Bank during a loan settlement in 2009. In 2017, CBI filed an FIR against the Roys and others, alleging criminal conspiracy, cheating, and criminal misconduct under various IPC sections and Prevention of Corruption Act.The FIR was based on a complaint by Sanjay Dutt of Quantum Securities Ltd, who claimed that RRPR Holdings Pvt Ltd, associated with the Roys, had obtained a Rs 500 crore loan from India Bulls Pvt Limited to acquire a 20% stake in NDTV through a public open offer.According to the FIR, RRPR Holdings also secured a Rs 375 crore loan (with Rs 350 crore disbursed) from ICICI Bank at 19% annual interest rate to repay the India Bulls loan. Dutt accused ICICI Bank of colluding, committing fraud, and conspiring with NDTV promoters to facilitate the transfer of ownership of a news broadcasting company to a shell company, violating various regulations and norms.The FIR stated that the Roys pledged their entire shareholding as collateral for this loan, failing to report the pledging to SEBI, stock exchanges, or Union ministry of information and broadcasting.Within a year, ICICI Bank agreed to a foreclosure of the loan, which allegedly resulted in a Rs 48 crore loss for the bank due to a partial interest waiver.In a separate case filed in 2019, CBI is investigating the Roys for allegedly violating foreign direct investment (FDI) rules between 2007 and 2009. The agency claims that an NDTV-incorporated company in London received a total FDI of US $163.43 million and invested the funds in various NDTV subsidiaries through complex transactions. The investigation in this case is ongoing.","The report cited ""insufficient legally admissible evidence"" regarding Rs 48 crore loss suffered by ICICI Bank during a loan settlement in 2009.
