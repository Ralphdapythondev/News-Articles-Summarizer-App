"Paddy variety in focus cuts cost, pollution in Delhi-NCR",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paddy-variety-in-focus-cuts-cost-pollution-in-delhi-ncr/articleshow/114234019.cms,"NEW DELHI: Short-duration paddy variety PR-126 , developed by Punjab Agricultural University , may be at the centre of controversy for being pushed by the AAP-led state govt despite its low yield but the benefit of it in terms of saving input cost is something which is not being factored in by opposition Congress that has raised its pitch against the variety.Besides reducing cost of farming, PR-126 has the potential to combat the menace of air pollution in Delhi-NCR as it gives enough post-harvesting window to farmers to prepare their farms for the next crop without resorting to stubble burning . So, more use of the short-duration variety means lesser episodes of biomass burning. Its result is, however, yet to be seen this year as peak harvest season is still a bit far.Unlike the most popular Pusa-44 variety, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which takes 155-160 days to grow, the short-duration PR-126 variety takes just 123-125 days. Taking 30-35 days less time means not only saving input cost in terms of irrigation but also saving energy and precious groundwater.The flip side of it is, however, 4-5 quintal per acre less yield of PR-126 compared to Pusa-44 which gives 35-36 quintal per acre. Even at the milling stage, it gives 5 kg less rice and this prompted leader of opposition in Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday to slam chief minister Bhagwant Mann for pushing PR-126.“The yield problem can, however, be resolved from the next season if the state opts for a high-yielding short-duration crop variety, Pusa-2090 , developed by IARI. This new variety matches Pusa-44 in terms of yield and PR-126 in terms of duration (123-125 days) to get mature and ready for harvest,” said an official in the agriculture ministry.The Pusa-2090 variety was, however, formally released this year only for Delhi. A few farmers in Punjab and Haryana have planted this new variety on a limited scale on an experimental basis, but it will take a couple of more years for its wider adoption.“Unlike Pusa-44 variety which matures in 155 to 160 days, the Pusa-2090 variety took just 120 to 125 days. Yields of both these varieties (34-35 quintal per acre) are almost the same,"" Shukhjeet Singh Bhangu, farmer from Kanakwal Bhanguan village of Sangrur district in Punjab, had told TOI last month.Bhangu, who planted Pusa-2090 in one acre of land on an experimental basis, said the new variety will give farmers an additional 30 days to prepare their farmlands for the next crops (mainly wheat), significantly reducing their reliance on stubble burning. He claimed to have distributed seeds of new variety to couple of more farmers in Sangruru district who have already harvested their paddy crops.The new variety will not only give farmers more time to prepare for next crop but also help them get equal yield at less input cost as they don't need to go for additional cycles of irrigation and spray if the crop is ready for harvest in 125 days instead of 155 days in the case of existing popular variety, Pusa-44.",Short-duration paddy variety PR-126 is at the centre of controversy for being pushed by the AAP-led state govt despite its low yield. But the benefit of it in terms of saving input cost is something which is not being factored in by opposition Congress.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114234040,imgsize-1260716,width-400,resizemode-4/114234040.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consult opposition leaders and political heads on the ""extremely sensitive and critical"" matter of bilateral relations with Canada.Amid escalating tensions between the two nations, Ramesh said in a post on X, “The Indian National Congress certainly hopes and expects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take into confidence the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses of Parliament and the leaders of other political parties on this extremely sensitive and critical issue of India-Canada relations .”This comes after a significant diplomatic move earlier on Monday, when India expelled six Canadian diplomats.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) summoned Canada's Charge d'Affaires, Stewart Wheeler, to convey India's strong objection to what it described as the ""baseless targeting"" of its diplomats in Canada. The government made it clear that the actions against its officials were unacceptable.Canada too, on Monday, expelled six Indian diplomats in relation to what it said was ""a targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the Government of India"".In a statement, the MEA announced the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats, including Stewart Wheeler, Acting High Commissioner, and several other high-ranking officials. “They have been asked to leave India by or before 11:59 pm on Saturday, October 19, 2024,” the statement read.This diplomatic standoff follows allegations from Canadian law enforcement authorities. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Mike Duheme claimed that they had uncovered information linking agents of the Indian government to criminal activities, including threats against the South Asian community, particularly those affiliated with the pro-Khalistan movement.Duheme further alleged that Indian diplomats had used their official positions to conduct “clandestine operations”, gathering information and engaging in other covert activities in Canada.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government has shared all relevant information about these allegations with its Five Eyes partners, particularly the United States. The allegations center around the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian national and designated terrorist by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA), who was killed outside a gurdwara in Surrey in June 2023.Relations between the two nations have deteriorated sharply since Trudeau's parliamentary address last year, where he claimed ""credible allegations"" of India's involvement in Nijjar’s killing. India has vehemently denied the accusations, branding them as “absurd” and “motivated.” In its response, the MEA said that Canada has allowed extremist and anti-India elements to thrive on its soil, further straining diplomatic ties.The MEA also warned that India reserves the right to take further actions in response to what it describes as the Trudeau government's support for extremist and separatist activities against India.As diplomatic relations between the two nations continue to sour, all eyes are on the Indian government to see whether Prime Minister Modi will heed the opposition's call for broader consultations on the issue.","Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consult opposition leaders and political heads.

LG invites Omar Abdullah to take oath as CM Wednesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lg-invites-omar-abdullah-to-take-oath-as-cm-wednesday/articleshow/114231381.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha invited National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah to take oath at 11.30am Wednesday as the first CM since the state became a Union territory in 2019.Monday’s invitation followed the Centre’s decision to revoke six years of President’s rule in J&K after the collapse of PDP-BJP govt in 2018. “I am pleased to invite you to form and lead the govt of J&K,” Sinha said in his letter, informing that he received a communication on Oct 11 from NC president Farooq Abdullah confirming Omar’s unanimous election as leader of the legislature party.Sources said Omar is set to be sworn in along with a council of at least nine other members.Though the names of the ministers are yet to be announced, sources said the ministry is likely to include at least one independent MLA. NC spokesperson and MLA Tanveer Sadiq said: “It is the prerogative of the CM to choose his council. It is not wise to speculate about the new cabinet.”Omar will lead a coalition govt, with NC holding 42 seats, Congress six, one each from CPM and AAP, and support from five independent MLAs — making up 55 legislators in the 95-member assembly, which consists of 90 elected and five nominated members.The LG also received letters of support from J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra, CPM secretary GN Malik, AAP national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta, and independent MLAs Payare Lal Sharma, Satish Sharma, Choudhury Mohammad Akram, Rameshwar Singh, and Muzafar Iqbal Khan.AAP is lobbying for a cabinet berth for Mehraj Malik, its lone MLA who defeated BJP’s Ganjay Singh Rana in Doda. “We have appealed to the alliance partners to ensure our MLA is given a space in govt,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said Monday.The appeal followed AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal’s visit to Doda, where he expressed gratitude to the people for electing Malik as the party’s first MLA in J&K.J&K Congress chief Karra said restoration of statehood, land rights, and job-related issues are more important than seeking ministerial positions in the Omar-led govt. “We have not yet discussed the distribution of ministerial berths with NC,” he said.This will be 54-year-old Omar’s second stint as CM, having first held the position in 2009 when the NC-Congress alliance formed a govt.However, unlike his previous tenure, Omar must now operate under a centralised governance structure where the LG controls crucial areas such as police, public order, the transfer of officials, and the power to nominate five assembly members.The changes limit the elected govt’s autonomy, raising concerns about the ability to deliver on campaign promises, including job creation, free electricity, and food distribution. “The LG’s extensive powers — far greater than those in other Union territories — will complicate governance,” a political analyst said.While senior NC member Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi said the party will continue advocating for the restoration of J&K’s statehood and special status, Omar might opt to defer these demands to avoid friction with BJP-led central govt, sources said.",J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha invited National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah to take oath at 11.30am Wednesday as the first CM since the state became a Union territory in 2019.

MUMBAI: Chief minister Eknath Shinde made a significant announcement in the state cabinet meeting on Monday. He announced a full toll waiver for light motor vehicles at all five toll nakas entering Mumbai. This order will be implemented from midnight.The toll nakas are managed by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRDC ), which has given a toll collection contract to a private company at Mumbai’s five entry points until 2026.RTI data received by activist Anil Galgali reveals that MSRDC awarded the contract for the five entry points of Mumbai for Rs 2242.35 crores to MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to collect tolls for constructing 31 flyovers and bridges in Mumbai. The toll nakas are located in Mulund, Dashiar, and Mankhurd .MSRDC informed Galgali that prior to 2010-11, MSRDC was collecting tolls on its own. “In the year 1999-2000, it collected Rs 28.35 crores. In the year 2010-2011, MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd was awarded the contract for toll collection, authorising collection up to November 19, 2026, for Rs 2242.35 crores. From 1999-2000 to 2015-2016, MSRDC spent Rs 119 crores on maintenance of these roads and bridges. MSRDC spent Rs 1058 crores on the construction of the 31 flyovers; this cost was to be recovered by the collection of tolls at the five entry points,” Galgali said.In August last year, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray demanded that the toll being collected at Mumbai’s entry points on the Western and Eastern Express Highways (WEH & EEH) should be scrapped immediately as the two roads were handed over by the MSRDC to the BMC.Galgali also wrote to CM Eknath Shinde and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , demanding an audit of MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. Galgali said that an audit would reevaluate how much toll money was collected by the company from 2016 to 2023.“There are many flyovers which were constructed prior to the year 2000, at the cost of the state exchequer, for which toll is being collected. Also, private entities like MEP Infrastructure are being given a chance to earn huge profits. Because now both EEH and WEH are being maintained by the BMC, the toll must be scrapped,” Galgali said.",Chief minister Eknath Shinde made a significant announcement in the state cabinet meeting on Monday.

"India, US to ink Predator deal today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-to-ink-predator-deal-today/articleshow/114228911.cms,"NEW DELHI: India and the US on Tuesday will ink the $3.3 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) contract for 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones, which will take the collective worth of lucrative Indian defence deals bagged by Washington to over $25 billion in less than two decades.The induction of 31 `hunter-killer’ high-altitude, long-endurance drones will boost India’s military capabilities in undertaking long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and precision strikes against high-value targets, especially in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) where China is rapidly expanding its naval presence and turnaround facilities.Under the govt-to-govt deal with the US, which was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, deliveries of the 31 remotely-piloted aircraft systems with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, will begin in about four years and be completed in six years, a defence ministry official told TOI.A separate contract will also be inked on Tuesday with drone-manufacturer General Atomics -- which will assemble some of the fighter-sized MQ-9Bs in India -- for the global MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility to be set up here, with 34% of the components to be sourced from Indian companies.“There will be performance-based logistics (PBL) for the MQ-9Bs (15 Sea Guardians for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF) through the depot-level MRO for eight years or 1.5 lakh flying hours, whichever is earlier,” the official said.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the capabilities of the MQ-9Bs are considered far better than China’s existing armed drones like Cai Hong-4 and Wing Loong-II, which are also being supplied to Pakistan.While there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) in the MQ-9B deal, General Atomics will provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such heavy-duty drones that are capable of firing missiles and precision-guided munitions on enemy targets before returning to their home bases to re-arm for their next mission like manned fighter jets.India plans to deploy the MQ-9B drones at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the IOR and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders.Only some NATO countries and close military allies of the US have the Predator or Reaper drones, which are controlled by satellites and have a proven track record in precision strikes in Afghanistan and other conflicts. Some critics, however, say the drones have largely operated in “uncontested air space” without facing a hostile air force or advanced surface-to-air missile systems.The MQ-9B contract will be the second largest deal that India has inked with the US after the induction of 11 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic-airlift aircraft by IAF at a cost of around $4.5 billion. The Navy, in turn, has inducted 12 P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft from the US for $3.2 billion.The IAF had also acquired 13 C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from the US for over $2.1 billion but lost one in a crash during a tactical low-level training sortie near Gwalior in March 2014, which killed the five personnel on board.","India and the US will ink the $3.3 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) contract for 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones.

"Baba Siddique murder: Shubham Lonkar quizzed in Salman firing case in May, but let off",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baba-siddique-murder-shubham-lonkar-quizzed-in-salman-firing-case-in-may-but-let-off/articleshow/114229034.cms,"MUMBAI/NAGPUR: The killing of Baba Siddique could potentially have been prevented if Mumbai police crime branch had investigated key suspect Shubham Lonkar and not let him go in the case of firing on Salman Khan ’s flat, sources in the police said.In June, crime branch had questioned Shubham from Pune for providing shelter to suspects in the Salman firing case. However, he was allowed to go after questioning citing lack of strong evidence.Now, during the investigations, when Shubham’s name has cropped up, Mumbai police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar got agitated and pulled up crime branch officers who investigated the case, sources said.An aspiring soldier, Shubham had failed the Indian Army recruitment test at Jaisalmer in 2018-19, and later entered the world of crime. His first fling with the law was as a teenager, when he was booked for assault by Akot police. Arrested seven years later in Jan this year with his elder brother, Pravin, for hoarding arms and cartridges, he was later bailed out.Earlier in May this year, members of the Bishnoi gang had fired at Khan’s residence in Bandra, and the crime branch had arrested five members of the gang — Vikas Gupta, Sagar Pal, Harpal Singh alias Harry, Rafiq Choudhary, and Banwarilal Gujar. The sixth accused, Anuj Thappan, died in police custody. During their interrogation, police came across the name of Shubham alias Shubbu Lonkar from Pune, who provided the accused shelter. The crime branch’s anti-extortion cell brought in Shubham and interrogated him at length, and after finding little evidence of his involvement in the crime, he was allowed to go, said sources.Sources said this lapse might have allowed Lonkar to remain active and involved in subsequent criminal activities, particularly to recruit fresh shooters and hatch a plot to kill Siddiqui on behalf of the Bishnoi gang. Police are still trying to figure out how Shubam came in contact with Bishnoi. It was Shubam who tweeted on social media, claiming responsibility for the killing of Siddiqui by the Bishnoi gang. Sources said absconding accused Zeeshan Akhtar could be the link between Bishnoi and Shubham, which needs to be probed.Police have arrested Shubham’s brother, Pravin, after finding his role in the attack on Siddique. The Lonkars run a milk dairy in Pune. The two arrested accused, Dharmaraj Kashyap and another wanted accused, Shivkumar Gautam, worked in a scrap shop next to Lonkars’.A now-deleted Facebook post by ‘Shubuu Lonkar Maharashtra’, which linked the murder to Bishnoi gang, dramatically shifted the focus of investigation to a radicalised son of a farmer from a nondescript Nivri Budruk village in Vidarbha’s Akola district. The post, according to police sources, was made by an underground Shubham Lonkar, prompting Mumbai police to launch a manhunt for him.Though Pravin was nabbed after Siddique’s murder, probe agencies are clueless about Shubham’s whereabouts. Sources said Lonkar brothers played a key role in planning and executing Siddique’s murder by hiring assailants from across India, supplying them with weapons & providing logistical support.","In June, crime branch had questioned Shubham from Pune for providing shelter to suspects in the Salman firing case.

Leader of the opposition in the Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa also claimed Mann misled farmers to use hybrid varieties of paddy which was also responsible for the situation.""I hold Arvind Kejriwal, Mann and central govt responsible for this crisis, which will also create a law and order situation,"" Bajwa said at a press conference in New Delhi. He sought the immediate intervention of the Centre, alleging that 185 lakh metric tonne of paddy was expected to arrive in mandis (markets) but there was no space available in godowns across the state, as previous stocks had not been cleared.Bajwa alleged the CM, like a ""brand ambassador"", propagated the use of PR-126 and similar hybrid varieties of paddy which farmers sowed at his instance ultimately leading to the present crisis.""Now it has been revealed that this variety yields about 5kg less rice per quintal after milling, as compared to traditional varieties. This will cause losses to rice millers to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore.

He said the arhtiyas were protesting and refusing to purchase the produce in the mandis.Congress's attack on AAP and BJP for allegedly waking up too late to speed up procurement and clear stocks came on the same day Mann met Union food minister Pralhad Joshi in Delhi. Bajwa cautioned of an ""impending agrarian crisis that could spiral out of control"".Bajwa said Mann should have met PM Narendra Modi and Joshi six months ago. Making accusations of a ""well thought out conspiracy"" by BJP and Mann, Bajwa alleged that the crisis was being created with an intention to force farmers to go for distress sale and help the industrial house of Adani buy the produce at cheap prices as ""he has massive storage capacity with silos in Moga, Raikot and Kathunangal in Punjab"".Accusing Mann of playing a double game, Bajwa alleged, ""He is inexperienced... he is a stand-up comedian, Punjab is paying a price for it.

It is completely within Parliament’s legislative domain to consider whether an act can be classified as an offence or not,” the CJI-led bench said, adding, “We cannot use our power under Article 142 to create an offence.” This may not be completely true as SC, in its landmark Vishaka judgment on Aug 13, 1997, had created sexual harassment at workplaces as a distinct offence after recording that “the present civil and penal laws in India do not adequately provide for specific protection of women from sexual harassment in workplaces and that enactment of such legislation will take considerable time”. Parliament took 16 more years to enact Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act.A month-and-a-half ago, Delhi HC had not only entertained a PIL by advocate Gantavya Gulati seeking inclusion of non-consensual unnatural sex and sodomy as offences in BNS but also urged Centre to bring an ordinance to penalise these “offences” pending considerations for amendment to BNS.While granting Centre six months to take a holistic view on inclusion of these “offences” in BNS, HC had said there could not be a vacuum in crime & punishment. “...Centre made even non-consensual (unnatural) sex non-punishable. Suppose something happens outside the court today, are we all to shut our eyes because it is not a penal offence in the statute books?” a bench of CJ Manmohan and Justice T R Gadela asked on Aug 29.SC in its 2018 judgment in Navtej Singh Johar case had decriminalised consensual sexual activities in private among same-sex adults but had kept other parts of Section 377 intact, which punished non-consensual unnatural sex or sodomy with imprisonment up to 10 years.",SC refused to entertain a PIL seeking a direction to Centre to create a provision in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita to punish non-consensual unnatural sex.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the UP BJP govt's decision in Feb 2023 to cancel the allocation of a prime land plot and a building in Rampur that had been leased at a nominal rent to the ' Maulana Mohd Ali Jauhar Trust ', run by the family of SP leader Azam Khan, while terming the 2012 allocation by the Akhilesh Yadav govt ""a gross misuse of power"".Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Trust, told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that the Feb 2023 decision was a gross illegality as the Trust was not intimated about the alleged grounds of irregularities and no opportunity was accorded to it to respond to the allegations.""There was a complete breach of principles of natural justice by this unilateral and arbitrary decision of the state govt,"" he said.The CJI-led bench said Azam Khan, who is the founder trustee, was minister for urban development and minority affairs (in the Akhilesh Singh govt). ""He allotted the land and building to the family trust in which he is a member. How can land belonging to a govt body be transferred to a private body? This is a gross case of misuse of power by the minister,"" the bench said.Sibal said, ""I do not dispute the facts. If the allotment was mala fide, the cancellation of the lease too was mala fide and politically motivated. The trust was operating a school which provided education to poor students and charging an annual fee of Rs 20. It was not used for profiteering. There are 300 students in the school who have not been able to take admission in other schools.""Refuting the allegation that Khan had played a pivotal role in the allocation of land and building to his family trust, Sibal said, it was a cabinet note approved by the cabinet headed by the then CM (Akhilesh Yadav - March 15, 2012, to March 19, 2017).The bench dismissed the trust's appeal against an Allahabad HC order validating the cancellation of leasing out of govt land and building to the private trust but requested the education department of the state to examine the grievance of students not getting admitted to other schools and ensure that their rights under the RTE Act are not violated.HC had said, ""Khan himself approved the cabinet note and played an active role in getting it approved.

India’s nuclear test at Pokhran

Trudeau’s support to

Khalistani

extremists and Kanishka bombing

The diplomatic ties between India and Canada hit the lowest on Monday after India decided to withdraw its high commissioner and some other ""targetted"" diplomats asserting that it has ""no faith"" in the Trudeau government. The move came after Canadian government, led by prime minister Justin Trudeau, attempted to implicate the Indian high commissioner in an investigation likely related to the murder of Sikh extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.India also issued a stern warning against the ""concocted"" allegations targeting its diplomat.India vehemently rejected the accusations against high commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, labeling them as ""preposterous imputations"" and attributing them to the ""political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centered around vote bank politics"". The ministry of external affairs (MEA) stated that India received a diplomatic communication from Canada, suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are ""persons of interest"" in an ongoing investigation in Canada.The relationship between India and Canada has been under significant strain since prime minister Trudeau's accusations in September last year, suggesting a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar, who was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2022. New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"". This, however, is not the first time India and Canada are staring at a historic low in its diplomatic ties under a Trudeau regime. Justin Trudeau’s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who served as Canada’s fifteenth prime minister also had a difficult relationship with India much like his son Justin Trudeau.In 1974, Ottawa's foreign policy experts were outraged when India conducted nuclear tests, suspecting that the Canadian-designed and collaboratively constructed CIRUS reactor was used. Canada had previously assumed that India shared its ideological opposition to nuclear weapons development. The Indian tests challenged this assumption, forcing Canada to reevaluate its understanding of Asia's emerging strategic landscape.India later carried out nuclear tests in Pokhran, Rajasthan in 1998, motivated by various domestic and external factors, including a growing consensus among India's political elites and scientific community, the security threat from China following the 1962 Sino-Indian war, and China's nuclear tests in Lop Nor. The aftermath of the tests saw a deterioration in India's relations with Canada and much of the Western world.Canada perceived the Pokhran event as a betrayal by India, with policymakers in Ottawa worried that Indian nuclear tests would encourage other non-nuclear states to pursue similar capabilities. As a result, Canada halted tentative nuclear cooperation with India. The then Foreign Minister Mitchell Sharp expressed his disappointment, stating that the ""trust between the two countries was gone.""Canada's former PM Pierre Elliott Trudeau had warned Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi about the repercussions India would encounter if it developed nuclear weapons capabilities. Trudeau's India policy aligned with his positive stance towards Communist states like China and a rejection of Washington's expectations for Canada's foreign policy. Consequently, Canadian policymakers became wary of any attempts to seek reconciliation with India, particularly regarding civil nuclear energy cooperation. This position was eventually abandoned during the Harper administration, leading to the signing of the Canada–India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.Following India's nuclear tests in 1998, Canada imposed sanctions on the South Asian nation. According to reports, the Canadian foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy, initiated a ""crusade"" against India in response to the tests.The sanctions remained in place until 2001 when they were finally lifted. However, it took another nine years for India and Canada to sign a civil nuclear agreement, which occurred in 2010.The nuclear tests and subsequent sanctions strained the relationship between the two countries for a significant period, highlighting the complex dynamics of international diplomacy and the consequences of pursuing nuclear capabilities.More than the nuclear test, Pierre Trudeau’s failure to take action against the Khalistani forces dealt a serious blow to Indo-Canadian relations.Several terrorists from Punjab took refuge in Canada after the crackdown on militancy in the 1980s. One such terrorist was Talwinder Singh Parmar. He fled to Canada after killing two police personnel in Punjab in 1981. Parmar, a member of the Khalistani group Babbar Khalsa, advocated for attacks on Indian diplomatic missions abroad and mass murder.India asked for Parmar to be extradited, but the Pierre Trudeau administration denied the request. Additionally, even warnings from Indian intelligence agencies remained unheeded.The final blow came when all 329 people on board Air India Flight 182 (Kanishka), which was traveling from Toronto to London, UK, on June 23, 1985, were killed when a bomb concealed in two luggage detonated. The majority of those killed in the Kanishka bombing were Canadians. Parmar, who Pierre Trudeau protected, was the bombing of Kanishka’s mastermind. In Punjab, he was murdered by police in 1992. Posters honoring Parmar were seen all around Canada in June of this year.Talwinder Singh Parmar was among those arrested in connection with the Kanishka bombing, but he was all released, and only one person was found guilty.In 1982, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi complained to Pierre Trudeau about the meek Canadian response to the Khalistani challenge, according to Terry Milewski, a retired CBC correspondent and author of “Blood for Blood – Fifty Years of the Global Khalistan Project.”","India withdraws its high commissioner and some other ""targetted"" diplomats from Canada. Move came after Canadian government attempted to implicate Indian high commissioner in an investigation likely related to the murder of Sikh extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India vehemently rejected the accusations against high commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, labeling them as ""preposterous imputations""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114220780,imgsize-43924,width-400,resizemode-4/114220780.jpg"

History with Trudeaus

NEW DELHI: Justin Trudeau 's aggression towards India coincides with the Canadian Prime Minister's sliding popularity ratings at home and growing dissent against him, which are being seen to have enhanced the need for him to woo the politically-significant Sikh community ahead of next year's federal elections.Amid complaints over rising cost of living, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rate, an Ipsos poll showed that just 26% saw Trudeau as the best PM candidate, 19 percentage points below Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.This comes after two electoral setbacks. Last month, the in-power Liberal Party lost in Montreal, seen as a safe seat, just three months after being defeated in a special election in Toronto after holding the seat for three decades. To make matters worse, Jagmeet Singh 's New Democratic Party withdrew support to the minority Liberal govt days before the Montreal loss. Singh has been a supporter of Khalistan There have been calls from Trudeau's party colleagues for him to step down, as many experts are predicting that the Liberals will face the same plight as the Conservatives in the UK. Trudeau is holding on after surviving two no-confidence motions in Parliament.Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan.India was always skeptical of Trudeau's policy on pro-Khalistan separatists. In 2018, PM Narendra Modi met him on the sixth day of his first official visit to the country amid a controversy over an invitation for a dinner at the Canadian high commission to businessman Jaspal Atwal who was convicted but later acquitted in a plot to assassinate a Punjab minister in Vancouver Island in 1986. While the invitation was withdrawn, Trudeau sought to distance himself from the controversy.There was, however, no change in stance as the Trudeau govt refused to clamp down on protests outside Indian consulates, some of which saw demonstrators burning the Indian flag.On the 40th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, processions in Ontario and Toronto saw floats depicting the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards in 1984. The Canadian govt refused to stop a referendum on Khalistan, which was backed by Sikhs for Justice.Relations hit a low after Trudeau alleged that ""Indian agents"" were involved in the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. The Canadian PM made the accusations soon after his return from New Delhi after the G20 Summit in Sept. India not only denied the allegations but sought concrete evidence, which Canada has refused to provide.The two sides halted negotiations for a trade agreement and India temporarily stopped processing visas as it feared for the safety of its mission staff in Canada. Over 40 Canadian diplomats were withdrawn from missions in India after New Delhi raised the principle of reciprocity in staffing.Canada also sought to include India in a probe into alleged election interference.During a meeting with Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi last year, PM Modi had expressed concern over anti-India activities in Canada by extremists.This is, however, not the first time that separatists have caused major friction in bilateral ties between India and Canada. Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, a former PM, was accused of mishandling ties with New Delhi as Canadian authorities had failed to act against Khalistani extremists in the 1980s.Elliott had refused India's request for extradition of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a member of Babbar Khalsa, who fled to Canada after being accused of killing two cops in Punjab. An alleged mastermind of the 1985 Kanishka bombing, he was killed in Punjab seven years later.","Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan.

"India recalls its envoy, other diplomats as Canada links them to Nijjar murder",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-recalls-its-envoy-other-diplomats-as-canada-links-them-to-nijjar-murder/articleshow/114230723.cms,"Reserve right to take further steps: India

A dramatic and unprecedented escalation in the year-long rift between India and Canada over the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in 2023 saw the former recalling high commissioner Sanjay Verma from Ottawa Monday after Canada alleged he and some other Indian diplomats were “persons of interest” in the murder.Several other diplomats and officials were also withdrawn.A Washington Post report said Canada had expelled six diplomats, including Verma, but the Indian side insisted they had been recalled.Late evening, New Delhi said it had expelled six Canadian diplomats, including the deputy high commissioner and charge d’affaires (acting high commissioner) Stewart Wheeler. They were asked to leave India by Oct 19 night.New Delhi summoned Wheeler and told him that the “baseless targeting” of Verma and other diplomats and officials in Canada was “completely unacceptable, and that in an atmosphere of extremism and violence, Trudeau govt’s actions endangered their safety”.We have no faith in the current Canadian govt’s commitment to ensure their (Indian diplomats’) security. Therefore, govt of India has decided to withdraw the high commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,” New Delhi said, adding it also conveyed that India reserved the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau govt’s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India.In a scathing and lengthy response to the “ludicrous” allegation, which was conveyed to India in a diplomatic communication on Sunday, Indian govt accused Canada of “pandering to the anti-India separatist agenda” and threatened action against the Canadian mission here for serving the “political agenda” of the Trudeau govt.The escalation by Canada followed a meeting last week between Trudeau and PM Narendra Modi in Laos after which the Canadian PM had said there were real issues between the two countries that needed to be addressed. Indian govt sources had responded by saying that there was no substantive engagement between the two and that bilateral ties could only be repaired if Canada took verifiable action against Khalistani separatists .Earlier in the day, acknowledging a diplomatic communication from Canada claiming that Verma and other diplomats were persons of interest in “a matter related to an investigation” in that country, India strongly rejected the “preposterous” imputations and ascribed them to Trudeau’s vote bank politics.While reiterating that the Canadian govt had not shared a shred of evidence to back Trudeau’s allegations last year about Indian involvement in the Nijjar case, govt said the latest assertions, which followed several rounds of exchanges between the two sides, were also not backed by facts. The intelligence community in both countries had remained in touch about the Nijjar probe but, according to Indian authorities, to no avail as Canada didn’t share any evidence.“This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains. Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort,” the Indian govt said.“His cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in Dec 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard,” it added, while recalling the Trudeau govt’s support to the farmers’ protests in Delhi in 2020.Taking cognisance of the activities of the Canadian high commission in India that served the “political agenda” of the Trudeau govt, India said this had led to implementation of the principle of reciprocity in regard to diplomatic representation. India had last year forced Canada to withdraw 41 diplomats alleging they were involved in anti-India activities. “India now reserves the right to take further steps in response to these latest efforts of the Canadian govt to concoct allegations against Indian diplomats,” govt said.In its response, India also said that under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, the Trudeau govt had deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage.“This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a commission on foreign interference,” govt said, adding the latest allegations also served the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau govt has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains.“To that end, the Trudeau govt has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada,” the govt said.Linked Images (2)","India recalls high commissioner Sanjay Verma from Ottawa.

The FIR stated that an amount of Rs 23 crore was credited from govt treasury to the bank account of Kumar, which he subsequently withdrew.JMM alleged the raids were part of “political vendetta” and that BJP had unleashed the central agency to target its opponents in view of upcoming elections. “We are going ahead with our people-centric work and they are doing their part of preparations,” CM Hemant Soren said without naming BJP.Thakur termed it a pressure tactics. “Since I refused to join BJP, the central agency has been pressed into action. They wanted me to bow down, but I will not bend even if I perish,” he said.Asked about Thakur’s allegations, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, said the party had no truck with Thakur, except for his role in irregularities in the funded scheme. “Water has not reached households and funds have been spent. Centre will trace the funds,” he added.","JMM alleged the raids were part of ‘political vendetta’ and that BJP had unleashed the central agency to target its opponents.

RAIPUR: The wife and 16-year-old daughter of a head constable in Chhattisgarh ’s Surajpur town were brutally murdered, allegedly by a history-sheeter who “hates police” so much that he had poured boiling oil on a patrol party a few hours before.The head constable was part of the team searching for the suspect, Kuldeep Sahu , after the oil attack. He returned home at 1am on Monday and walked into a scene of horror — blood splatters on the walls and ceilings and puddles on the floor.His wife and daughter were missing. The bodies were found 7km away in separate ditches, said Surajpur SP M R Ahire.Police fear the mother and daughter were raped because they were found nude. A mob torched Sahu’s house and gheraoed Kotwali PS.A police team saw him trying to speed away in a car and shot out its tyres, but he got into another vehicle and fled. SP Ahire said the first getaway vehicle had blood stains.On Monday, a mob of 500 gheraoed Kotwali police station in Surajpur, 350km from Raipur, demanding to know why Sahu hadn’t been arrested yet. They marched to his house, burned it down, and chased and thrashed an SDM when he tried to prevent the arson. The mob also set fire to a warehouse belonging to Sahu’s relative, triggering explosions as several LPG cylinders were stored there.Surajpur town was in shutdown mode all day. Sahu’s family was shifted to a safe place. Surguja range IG Ankit Garg is camping in town. It’s not clear if more than one person was involved in the double murder . Several police teams are out looking for Sahu. “He is a habitual and dangerous offender. Action had been taken against him in the past,” the IG said.Sahu is notorious for carrying grudges against police, which he acts out brazenly. He seemed to particularly target the head constable for reasons police are yet to understand. The latest round of attacks seem to have been triggered by arrest of his brother Sandeep, who allegedly threw a relative from the terrace of his house, say police. On Sunday evening, when a police team was patrolling the streets during a Durga puja procession, Sahu allegedly hurled a cauldron of boiling oil at them, which fell on a constable, severely burning him.Sahu escaped in the chaos and soon, police teams were all over town, looking for him. Sahu knew the head constable was among them and his wife and daughter would be alone at home, say police. The family lived on the first floor of a two-storey house, whose ground-floor occupants were on vacation. He managed to sneak into the house unchallenged and unleashed a horrific attack, say police.BJP alleged that Sahu was associated with Congress, which the opposition party has denied. Ex-CM and Congress neta Bhupesh Baghel said “it seems law has vanished from our state”.",Police fear mother and daughter were raped because they were found nude.
