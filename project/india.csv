Nagaland moves SC to prosecute 30 Armymen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagaland-moves-sc-to-prosecute-30-armymen/articleshow/111767845.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday admitted a writ petition by Nagaland govt challenging the Centre’s one-and-a-half-year-old order denying sanction for prosecution of 30 Armymen who were named in the FIR lodged by state police for killing 13 civilians in a botched-up operation to ambush militants in Mon district on Dec 4, 2021.Moving the petition, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution invoking violation of the fundamental rights of citizens, before a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra , state advocate general K N Balgopal said though state police has clinching evidence against the Armymen, including a Major, the Centre has arbitrarily refused to accord sanction for their prosecution.“The competent authority in the Union government has, without application of mind and going through the entire material collected by the special investigation team (of state police) during the course of investigation, arbitrarily and against public interest refused sanction to prosecute the accused Armymen,” Nagaland govt said.The bench issued notices to the Centre and the ministry of defence and sought their responses within four weeks.In July 2022, the SC had stayed prosecution of the armed force personnel belonging to Alpha team of 21 Para (Special Forces) on petitions from the wives of the accused as they claimed that their husbands were being prosecuted without the state obtaining mandatory sanction for prosecution from the Centre. They had also sought quashing of the FIRs .

The Army surveillance team had no basic knowledge about ground realities in Nagaland, where it is common to carry hunting guns ,” the state said.After the initial ambush killed six civilians, angry villagers clashed with the Army, leading to the death of another seven villagers and a soldier.

Supreme Court rejects plea for review of January 3 order on Adani-Hindenburg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-rejects-plea-for-review-of-january-3-order-on-adani-hindenburg/articleshow/111767739.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has refused to revisit its January 3 judgement that had rejected an SIT or CBI probe into short-seller Hindenburg’s Jan 2022 report, which sharply eroded the share value of Adani group companies and caused a stock market meltdown.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had disposed of a bunch of PILs on Jan 3 on finding lack of merit in their allegations about market regulator Sebi not doing its job to investigate Hindenburg’s charge of stock market manipulation by Adani group companies and a demand for a thorough probe by the CBI or a special investigation team.The court had ordered central agencies to probe Hindenburg’s role in causing loss to Indian investors.PIL petitioner Anamika Jaiswal, through advocate Prashant Bhushan, had filed a review petition in Feb alleging glaring errors in the judgment. The petition said the verdict did not take into account lapses on Sebi’s part to investigate Adani group, and disregarding Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) inputs on alleged wrongdoings by the group.During the review, the bench held that its judgment had specifically dealt with these two allegations and rejected the review petition. The order, passed on May 8 but uploaded recently on the SC website, said, “Having perused the review petition, there is no error apparent on the face of the record. No case for review under the Supreme Court Rules 2013 (is made out). The review petition is, therefore, dismissed.”In its Jan 3 order, the SC had discarded as unauthentic a report by Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which is linked to controversial billionaire George Soros, and which was relied upon by media to lend credence to Hindenburg Research’s claim of stock manipulations by Adani group companies and failure of Sebi to probe the short seller’s charges.It had said the petitioners rested their cases solely on inferences drawn from the report by OCCRP, a third-party organisation involved in investigative reporting. “The facts of this case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from Sebi. In an appropriate case, this court does have the power to transfer an investigation being carried out by the authorised agency to an SIT or CBI. Such power is exercised in extraordinary circumstances when the competent authority portrays a glaring, wilful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation. The threshold for the transfer of investigation has not been demonstrated to exist (in this case),” the bench had said.",Supreme Court refused to revisit its January 3 judgement that had rejected an SIT or CBI probe into short-seller Hindenburg’s Jan 2022 report.

This matter will definitely be investigated. Who had said about the duplicate keys, and under whose instruction will also be examined,"" said Law Minister Prithviraj Harichandan.The Ratna Bhandar was reopened on Sunday after 46 years for an inventory of valuables and the repair of its structure.The minister expressed hope that no one had touched Lord Jagannath's ornaments, as doing so would have consequences. He added that a clear picture of the situation can be obtained after the completion of the inventory.""I hope that such an incident might not have happened. We can get a clear picture of this after completion of the inventory,"" Harichandan said.Meanwhile, the government had attempted to reopen the Ratna Bhandar for a physical examination on April 4 2018 but it remained unsuccessful due to the unavailability of the keys. However, the government said duplicate keys were found after some days.The reopening of the Ratna Bhandar was a significant political issue during the recent assembly elections, which saw the BJP come to power, dethroning the BJD that had been ruling the state since 2000.Senior BJD leader Amar Prasad Satpathy called for the public release of the Justice Raghubir Das Commission report, which was formed to investigate the issue of missing keys of the shrine's treasury. The commission submitted its report to the state government in November 2018, but it was not made public.Both the opposition party Congress and the BJD have urged the BJP government to provide a clear explanation to the public regarding the Ratna Bhandar keys.Odisha Congress spokesperson Biswaranjan Mohanty questioned the reason for breaking the locks and the whereabouts of the original keys, stating that the people are eagerly waiting for answers.The Ratna Bhandar, situated in the temple's basement, consists of two parts: the outer chamber, which stores ornaments used by the deities daily, and the inner chamber, which houses numerous pieces of jewelry.",Jagannath temple chief administrator Arabinda Padhee said that members of a special committee tried to open three locks on the doors of the inner chamber using two 'duplicate' keys.

The two countries share numerous rivers that flow from the Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal.An agreement on sharing the river’s water was reached in 2011 but could not be sealed after West Bengal, through which the river flows before it enters Bangladesh, objected to the deal.As India has dithered over resolving the issue, China stepped in with its proposal. New Delhi responded earlier this year with its own offer amid security concerns about Chinese engineers working close to its borders.“China has made an offer to us, they did a feasibility study. India has also made an offer, and will do a feasibility study,” Hasina said added, “But I would give greater priority to this being done by India because India has held up the Teesta’s waters.”",China and India both want to execute the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration.

Think tank: Give Rs 35k per hectare for shift away from paddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/think-tank-give-rs-35k-per-hectare-for-shift-away-from-paddy/articleshow/111763930.cms,"NEW DELHI: A paper by ICRIER economists led by Ashok Gulati has suggested a transfer of Rs 35,000 a hectare to farmers who shift from paddy to pulses, oilseeds, millets, and maize during the kharif season along with procurement of these crops at the minimum support price for five years.Underlining the need for diversification in Punjab and Haryana , it has proposed that the cost be split 50:50 between the state and the Centre.""Haryana is already giving Rs 17,500 a hectare and the Centre needs to double it. Interestingly, there is hardly any additional expenditure involved. It is the savings on power, canal waters, and fertiliser subsidies that need to be given back to farmers in a different form. If this is done, India can save the most fertile plains of Punjab-Haryana from potential desertification,"" it said.The paper comes months after farmer unions from Punjab were offered a package by a team of central ministers assuring govt procurement for five years to tillers who diversify into pulses, maize and oilseeds.The paper titled 'Saving Punjab and Haryana from Ecological Disaster: Re-aligning Agri-Food Policies' has concluded that the current regime is unsustainable and results in massive groundwater extraction for paddy cultivation and the two northern states accounted for a substantial part of the fertiliser subsidy as they consumed more fertiliser that their counterparts during kharif season that starts in June.""Taking Punjab as an example, the combined subsidies from the govt of Punjab and the govt of India amounted to a staggering Rs 38,973 per hectare during 2023-24. When considering additional subsidies for managing crop residues both in the field and after harvest, the financial support for paddy cultivation would easily go beyond Rs 40,000 per hectare,"" it said.With subsidies contributing to nearly one-third of the profitability for paddy, the gains from the crop are far higher than others grown during the season - as much as Rs 68,849 a hectare when compared with bajra.What has encouraged the cultivation of paddy is assured procurement at the minimum support price, something that is not available to other crops grown during the season.As a result, the paper has proposed diversification of 12-14 lakh hectare from paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana with govt offering upfront incentive of Rs 30,000-40,000 a hectare by repurposing power subsidy, offered by the state, and fertiliser subsidy, given by the Centre.There are other recommendations such as public-private partnership for carbon credits for diversifying away from paddy, which emits five tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare.","A paper by ICRIER economists led by Ashok Gulati has suggested a transfer of Rs 35,000 a hectare to farmers who shift from paddy to pulses, oilseeds, millets, and maize.

Of these 523 of them are lodged in Jharkhand (282) and West Bengal (241).NALSA in its report said that these figures about convicts not filing appeals against their convictions were also due to jail authorities not ascertaining the views of inmates. NALSA counsel Rashmi Nandkumar told the bench that state legal services authorities of major states like Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat have not filed their responses in this regard. SC sought their responses in three weeks.Hansaria pointed out that the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee received 503 applications for legal aid from prisoners to file appeals against their conviction being upheld by the concerned high courts . In many cases, the application for legal aid has been received to file an appeal in the SC after a long lapse of time, in some cases after 20 years.Interestingly, in Meghalaya 150 of 308 convicts have filed appeals. But as many as 79 of them do not want to file appeals because they are reconciled to their punishment or have almost completed their sentences. Similarly, in Puducherry of the 102 convicts, as many as 95 do not want to file appeals against their convictions, while the number of such cases in West Bengal is 384.","Of the convicts surveyed, 544 are facing death sentence, 75,629 have been sentenced to life.
