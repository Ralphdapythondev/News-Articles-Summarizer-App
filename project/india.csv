"In Mandya, the battle is for Vokkaliga crown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-mandya-the-battle-is-for-vokkaliga-crown/articleshow/109546060.cms,"MANDYA: On the face of it, Mandya parliamentary constituency presents a picture of a David vs Goliath battle, but appearances can be deceptive.Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy , the candidate of the JD(S)-BJP combine, is no doubt a titan, but his main rival, Congress’s Venkataramane Gowda, aka ‘Star’ Chandru, is no pushover. The richest candidate in the Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka, Chandru is worth over Rs 620 crore and has been laying the ground for this contest for months.More importantly, KPCC president and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has thrown his weight behind Chandru, in what is seen by many as an election that will decide who among the two — HDK or DKS — will don the mantle of Vokkaliga leader.This is the second successive time that Mandya is witnessing such a sensational poll battle. In 2019, HDK’s son Nikhil, who was the candidate of then JD(S)-Congress combine, was humbled by actor politician and Independent candidate Sumalatha Ambareesh. A large section of Congress functionaries covertly supported Sumalatha with the objective of defeating Nikhil, citing the electorate’s perceived discomfort with the dynastic politics of JD(S). This time, too, there are murmurs about HDK snatching the party ticket after promising it to former MP C S Puttaraju.HDK, though, is unfazed and confident of pulling off a win as he maintains that his decision to contest was based on the collective decision of party workers. There is also speculation that the BJP brass insisted that he contest.HDK says he is not even spending time electioneering in Mandya and is busy campaigning for NDA candidates in other constituencies such as Tumakuru, Chikkaballapur, Chitradurga, Kolar and Bangalore Rural. “I will win by a huge margin,” he asserts.The speculation that HDK could be made agriculture minister in the Union Cabinet if NDA returns to office is also helping him consolidate the support of constituents. His camp is trying to play upon Vokkaliga pride by claiming that it would be the second time after HDK’s father and JD(S) supremo Deve Gowda became PM that someone from their community would get an important role at the Centre.On the other side of the fence, deputy CM D K Shivakumar, too, is playing the Vokkaliga card to the hilt.Reminding his community that he has ensured as many as eight Vokkaligas have got Congress tickets in the first phase of polls covering 14 Lok Sabha seats, he is appealing to Mandya voters that a victory for Congress in the Vokkaliga heartland, which includes Mandya, Hassan, Bangalore Rural and MysoreKodagu, may propel him to the CM’s post.“I know you voted for our party in the assembly polls in the hope that I would become something big (chief minister). You ensure our victory in the Lok Sabha polls as well and your wish will come true,” Shivakumar told voters when he launched the party’s campaign in early April.“The fight in Mandya is actually between Kumaraswamy and Shivakumar to become the unquestionable leader of Vokkaligas, the status that H D Deve Gowda once enjoyed,” said K N Boralingaiah, a Kannada professor and Mandya voter.With Vokkaligas accounting for about 35% of the 17.8 lakh electorate of Mandya, the support of other communities, including OBCs, mainly Kurubas, Dalits and Muslims, is decisive. Congress has deployed a strong team of poll strategists led by agriculture minister N Cheluvrayaswamy and KPCC working president G C Chandrashekhar.“Sumalatha’s victory was possible because of the unity in the Congress camp that saw Kurubas vote for her. We are putting up a similar united fight this time as well,” said former KPCC president and CM Siddaramaiah ’s confidant B S Shivanna, who has taken up the responsibility of consolidating Kuruba votes.The JD(S) camp has labelled ‘Star’ Chandru as an outsider as he hails from Gauribidanur in Chikkaballapur district, even though he insists that his roots are in Nagamangala, an assembly segment in Mandya.“People won’t pay heed to the canards being spread by JD(S). I am confident of winning as we are seeking votes in the name of five guarantees that our govt has successfully implemented, and the leadership of Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar,” said Chandru.","Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy is the candidate of the JD(S)-BJP combine. His main rival, Congress’s Venkataramane Gowda, aka ‘Star’ Chandru, is no pushover. KPCC president and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has thrown his weight behind Chandru.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109546894,imgsize-34734,width-400,resizemode-4/109546894.jpg"
"In Madhya Pradesh, Congress struggles to break saffron stranglehold on 6 seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-madhya-pradesh-congress-struggles-to-break-saffron-stranglehold-on-6-seats/articleshow/109546620.cms,"Six longstanding BJP strongholds in Madhya Pradesh are up for grabs in round 2 of 2024 Lok Sabha elections, as Congress grapples to arrest the saffron tide that’s flowed unchecked in these constituencies for two decades.All the six Lok Sabha seats — Tikamgarh, Damoh, Khajuraho, Satna, Rewa and Hoshangabad — have incumbent BJP MPs and crisscross Madhya Pradesh’s political map — three in Bundelkhand and two in Vindhyachal and one in Narmadapuram.Congress last won two of these seats in 1999, and BSP has made inroads in Rewa.For Congress, the battle for these constituencies did not start on a promising note as INDIA bloc seems to have virtually handed over Khajuraho in Bundelkhand to BJP, thanks to a bizarre blunder. Under the seat-sharing deal, Congress left Khajuraho to SP and named candidates for the remaining 28 seats in the state. SP tied itself in knots from the word go. It first fielded a little-known Manoj Yadav against BJP’s candidate—state party chief V D Sharma, and then withdrew his candidature to name former MLA Meera Deepak Yadav. Meera forgot to sign nomination papers and her candidature was rejected.A stunned Congress is now backing Forward Bloc candidate R B Prajapati. Khajuraho is now being seen as an easy win for Sharma and BJP, with the talk of the town being “by what margin?”. In 2019, Sharma won the seat by more than 4.9 lakh votes. This time, BJP is hoping for a record, with PM Narendra Modi giving it a fillip. In Damoh on April 19, the PM said: “This V D Sharma looks lean and thin but under his leadership, BJP has set a new record in the assembly elections.”The other two seats in Bundelkhand — Tikamgarh and Damoh — have proved to be tough for Congress. Union minister Virendra Kumar Khatik has been representing the resereved Tikamgarh seat since the constituency came into existence in 2009. He is an old war-horse who won Sagar LS seat four times before shifting to Tikamgarh. Every time, Congress changes its candidate here, but has never come close to beating Khatik. His smallest victory margin of 41,862 votes was when Congress fielded a namesake — Virendra Ahirwar — in 2009. This time, Congress has fielded a young face, the party’s state SC cell vice-president Pankaj Ahirwar. He wanted to contest the Nov 2023 assembly polls from Jatara but was denied a ticket.When he rebelled, the party pacified him with a Lok Sabha ticket against the Union minister — quite a challenge for an electoral greenhorn.Even with no big leader in fray, Damoh fight is interesting. The constituency was represented by Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel till Dec last year, when he was fielded in the assembly elections. Patel, a two-time MP, is now an MLA from Narsinghpur and a minister in the state govt. So now, Damoh is set for a clash between two former Uma Bharti loyalists — Rahul Singh Lodhi and Tarbar Singh Lodhi.Both quit BJP before the 2018 assembly polls to join Congress. Former CM Kamal Nath fielded Rahul as Congress candidate in Damoh, and Tarbar from Banda. Both won. However, after the fall of the 15-month Nath govt in March 2020, Rahul returned to BJP. In the bypoll that followed, Rahul lost as BJP candidate to Congress’ Ajay Tandon. He was not given a ticket in the 2023 assembly elections. Tarbar, still with Congress, was defeated in Banda.Now, Rahul is BJP’s candidate from Damoh and Tarbar is Congress’s. Political grapevine says their families are related. Talk about a close fight.At Hoshangabad in Narmadapuram, BJP has fielded a candidate with five master’s degrees and a gamchha around his head — farmer leader Darshan Singh Choudhary. BJP had to look for a fresh candidate because sitting MP Uday Pratap Singh is now an MLA and a state minister. Choudhary, who led many agrarian movements in Narmada valley and is BJP’s state Kisan Morcha president, looks the part with a white beard and a white turban. He is an MA in Philosophy, English, History, Economics and Sociology. Though new to Lok Sabha elections, he is a well-known face.Pitted against him is Congress’ Sanjay Sharma, two-time MLA from Tendukheda, a segment of Hoshangabad LS constituency. Sharma, one of the richest politicians in the state, lost to BJP’s Vishwanath Singh in Tendukheda in the 2023 assembly elections.Satna constituency in Vindhyachal could see an intense fight between BJP’s four-time MP Ganesh Singh and Congress’ young MLA Siddharth Kushwaha. Five months ago, Singh lost to Kushwaha by 4,041 votes in Satna assembly seat. Kushwaha, 39, is the son of former MLA Sukhlal Kushwaha and has proved to be a giant slayer. In the 2018 assembly polls, he defeated BJP’s three-time MLA Shankarlal Tiwari.In Rewa, BJP has fielded its incumbent MP Janardhan Mishra against Congress’s Neelam Mishra. Janardhan won the seat in 2014 too. Neelam is the wife of Congress leader and Rewa mayor Abhay Mishra. In a constituency where Brahmin votes have the edge, both parties have always fielded candidates from the community. Of the eight assembly segments that make the Lok Sabha constituency, only Semaria is with Congress.Betul, another seat in Narmadapuram, was set to go to polls in the second phase but the Election Commission has postponed the exercise to May 7 following BSP candidate Ashok Bhalavi’s death on April 9.","Tikamgarh, Damoh, Khajuraho, Satna, Rewa and Hoshangabad have incumbent BJP MPs. Congress last won two of these seats in 1999, and BSP has made inroads in Rewa.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109546721,imgsize-1249302,width-400,resizemode-4/109546721.jpg"
Reel Ram’s Real Rally: Mythology & politics intertwine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reel-rams-real-rally-mythology-politics-intertwine/articleshow/109546465.cms,"MEERUT: From the narrow alleys of Mairashtra (the ancient name of Meerut) to the vibrant streets of the modern-day city, Arun Govil , instantly recognisable as ‘ Lord Ram ’ thanks to the hugely popular TV version of Ramayan in the ’80s, hops out of a luxury car and steps onto a decorated truck, at times walking through the congested streets to meet people at their doorsteps.The more devoted ones reach out to touch his feet.In most areas, BJP flags flutter, marigold petals carpet the ground, and religious chants — mostly ‘Jai Shri Ram’ — echo from speakers mounted on vehicles. The people in the crowd lining the Hindu-majority Suraj Kund Road have their mobile phones ready to capture their very own ‘Ramayan’ moment as Govil waves at them from the truck, occasionally ducking to dodge the low-hanging power lines near the walled city.Kamal Dutt Sharma, a BJP functionary accompanying Govil on the truck, issues a cautionary note on the public address system. “Bijli ke taaron se koi dosti nahi… in taaron se bachkar chalein (These wires are no one’s friends. Please steer clear of them).”Children run alongside the truck, which is adorned with photographs of Govil dressed as Ram. He is presented with sweets and handed a decorative bow and arrow. The ‘demon slayer’ draws back the arrow and points the bow towards a locale known as Ravan ka sasural (the home of Ravan’s wife, Mandodari, believed to be in Meerut). As the arrow is released, the area resounds with chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’.Arun Chandraprakash Govil (72) has returned to his janmabhoomi to contest the polls, spurred by the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol in Ayodhya earlier this year. “Meerut is my new karmabhoomi,” he tells TOI. Accompanied by actors Deepika Chikhlia and Sunil Lahri, who played his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, respectively, on the show, Govil exerts the Ramayan magic ahead of the looming second phase of the polls that cover eight west UP seats.Despite the orchestrated spectacle, there are diverse opinions about Govil’s prospects. Stuck in a serpentine traffic jam behind his truck, auto driver Amit Kumar offers a cautionary tale about the fleeting charisma of actors. “In 2006, actor Nagma, too, had caused similar euphoria as a Congress candidate. She was indeed beautiful, but she couldn’t win Meerut. I believe she lost her deposit as well. Whether Ram’s aura translates into votes for Govil is to be seen,” he says.In contrast, trader Ashutosh Gupta perceives Govil as BJP’s potent Hindutva face, buoyed by PM Modi’s support. “It’s a BJP wave, as we can all see. Govil is new to politics, but Modiji as his back. He and us need not worry,” he says, making it clear which side of the political fence he is on.Amid the enthusiastic crowds, passerby Aftab Ansari remains indifferent, seeking an escape from the “madness”. Hurriedly negotiating his way through the ecstatic crowds, he does not stop walking even as he says, “Arre sahab, mere liye to bas yahaan se nikalna hi behtar hai (Getting out of here is my priority right now).”One thing is clear though: Challenges loom for Govil, and the contest won’t be a cakewalk. With SP fielding Sunita Verma, a Dalit and former mayor of Meerut, and the absence of a Muslim candidate, the dynamics have shifted significantly.Analyst Puneet Sharma underscores the importance of minority and Dalit votes, highlighting Govil’s uphill battle. “With Sunita’s candidature, there is no split in Muslim votes since no major party has nominated any candidate from the minority community,” he says.“The Meerut-Hapur constituency has six lakh Muslims and three lakh Dalits on the voter rolls, together constituting 50% of the electorate. Additionally, there are 1.3 lakh OBC votes. Meanwhile, Devratt Tyagi of BSP will attract Tyagi Brahmin votes,” said Puneet Sharma, a resident of Meerut.Sharma, too, cautions against predicting Govil’s win as a foregone conclusion. “Remember the last election? BJP’s Rajendra Aggarwal secured victory by a slim margin of over 4,000 votes against BSP’s Muslim candidate Yaqub Qureshi. Govil faces a formidable challenge,” he concludes.","Arun Chandraprakash Govil (72) has returned to his janmabhoomi to contest the polls.

"Can we skip spectrum auction in some cases, Centre asks SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-we-skip-spectrum-auction-in-some-cases-centre-asks-sc/articleshow/109544555.cms,"NEW DELHI:

overnment has moved Supreme Court seeking clarification on assigning spectrum for specific purposes — such as satellite communication, for use by defence forces and PSUs, and for Metro or railway operations — instead of auctions, mandated by the apex court in 2012 following the 2G scam .The petition, which was filed last Dec, came up for hearing on Monday.In late Dec, Parliament had passed the new telecom law , which provides for 19 exemptions, including those for which govt had moved SC.Despite the 2012 ruling, govt was already allocating spectrum for specific requirements of national security and public infrastructure, administratively. The petition and the new law also included spectrum for space communication within the ambit of administrative allocation.In light of the SC verdict in the spectrum case, the administrative assignments have come with the rider that they will “not be treated as final, but purely interim and provisional; subject to govt’s final decision on pricing and policy in the matter”, the petition said.Govt is emphatic that it will stick to the auction route when it comes to commercial use such as mobile communication to offer 2G, 4G or 5G services. “We are already following an auction process for spectrum for mobile services and will continue to follow it. Which is what the law is,” communications minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Tuesday evening as he sought to dispel any impression of a reversal in govt policy.The department of telecom (DoT) is working on the next round of auction for 5G and other services in June, sources said.There are certain resources which cannot be auctioned, like airwaves for satellite communication and backhaul spectrum. “The frequency is reusable and cannot be sold exclusively to any single player,” said a source.According to an agency report on Monday, attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for the Centre, mentioned an interim application before a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala. While seeking urgent listing of the application, the top law officer told the bench that the plea sought modification of the 2012 verdict as the Centre wanted to grant 2G spectrum licences in some cases.Appearing for Centre for Public Interest Litigation, advocate Prashant Bhushan opposed the application and said the issue was settled by the apex court that auction was the only mode for granting licences for natural resources like spectrum.In its 15-page petition, govt said it has been auctioning spectrum from time to time but argued that assignment of airwaves was required for “non-commercial use for discharge of sovereign and public interest functions, such as security, safety, disaster preparedness”. This, it argued, was required due to the nature of spectrum or international practices as auctions were not “technically or economically preferred or optimal”.The court did not take into account the need for carveouts in certain cases, prompting the Centre to assign spectrum for specific use at administratively determined prices, the petition said.","The petition, which was filed last Dec, came up for hearing on Monday.

"Missing from poll talk, Shiromani Akali Dal rakes up sacrilege this time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/missing-from-poll-talk-shiromani-akali-dal-rakes-up-sacrilege-this-time/articleshow/109545232.cms,"JALANDHAR: Having remained largely missing from public discourse this year, after being a core issue in the 2017 and 2022 assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Punjab , sacrilege cases and investigations into them have been raised again.In a post on its official Facebook page on Sunday, Shiromani Akali Dal raked up the slow pace of investigations into cases of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab in 2015, when SAD was the incumbent in Punjab along with BJP.Shiromani Akali Dal, which is now aiming to recover its lost base among the Sikhs, also hinted at Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim's alleged involvement in the cases, even as it did not explicitly name him. In all these years, barring a couple of its leaders, the SAD had not been mentioning Dera Sacha Sauda or Gurmeet Ram Rahim in connection with sacrilege cases. The party hass also maintained that the SAD and its govt were unfairly targeted over the cases, even as they were not at fault.SAD posted that in the last two years, chief minister Bhagwant Mann had not given sanction for prosecution of the chief conspirator in sacrilege cases. It also posted a news clipping of a prominent Punjabi daily, which mentioned that the govt failed to give sanction to prosecute Gurmeet Ram Rahim and now it had also stopped responding to the issue.Akali Dal also posted that the state govt was not properly following the cases already being pursued in courts. ""Till now, culprits had been convicted only in the case pertaining to sacrilege at Gurusar Bhagta village, which were registered by SAD govt. Congress and AAP used the sentiments of Sikh community only for political ends,"" it said. ""AAP government is colluding with culprits of sacrilege and is protecting them,"" it added.Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan police firing of Oct 2015 were among the main issues along with drugs, illegal mining and unemployment in the 2017 and 2022 assembly elections, and 2019 parliamentary elections. The issues worked against SAD in a big way and the party lost a significant section of its core vote base among Sikhs, first losing even the space of main opposition party to AAP in 2017 and then in 2022 plummeting to just three of the total 117 seats in Punjab assembly.After the Bargari case was cracked in 2019 and Sirsa dera followers were arrested, SAD had been refraining from naming the dera or its chief. Of late, Akali leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Virsa Singh Valotoha had strongly criticised repeated paroles to the Sirsa dera chief. It was mainly left to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee to speak on the issue.In Dec last year, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had apologised to the Sikh community for sacrilege incidents that took place under SAD rule. He had said that after his party would form the govt, the ""real culprits"" would be thrown into jail.","Shiromani Akali Dal raked up the slow pace of investigations into cases of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab in 2015.

"Australian journalist alleges visa denial, amid poll coverage dispute, govt denies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/australian-journalist-alleges-visa-denial-amid-poll-coverage-dispute-govt-denies/articleshow/109542480.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) journalist has alleged that India denied a visa extension to her, forcing her out of the country, because she “crossed a line” in her reporting of a documentary on the alleged involvement of Indian agents in killings abroad. ABC’s South Asia bureau chief Avani Dias had produced the documentary — Sikhs, Spies, and Murder — which India got YouTube to block last month.Indian govt sources, however, said the ABC journalist ’s contention that she was not allowed to cover elections and compelled to leave the country is “not correct, misleading and mischievous”. They said Dias was found to have violated visa rules while undertaking her professional pursuits. Despite this, on her request, she was assured that her visa would be extended for coverage of the general elections, they added.The ABC journalist’s previous visa was valid until April 20, 2024. She paid the visa fee on April 18, one day before her “sudden departure”, and on the same day, her visa was extended until end-June, the sources said. She, however, chose to leave India on April 20 and at the time of her departure Dias held a valid visa, and her visa extension stood approved.“Her point about not been given permission to cover elections is also factually incorrect. Coverage of election activities outside of booths is permitted to all ‘ journalist visa ’ holders. Authority letters are required only for access to polling booths and counting stations. This, however, cannot be processed while the visa extension is under process. It is pertinent to note that other ABC correspondents — Meghna Bali and Som Patidar — have already received their letters,” Indian govt sources said.The journalist, however, said in a post on X that she was told her election accreditation would not come through because of an Indian ministry directive. “We left on day one of voting in the national election in what Modi calls ‘the mother of democracy’,” said Dias, who had been working in India since 2022.She added that after intervention by Australian govt, her visa was extended for two months but it was conveyed “less than 24 hours before my flight”. A govt official, who did not want to be named, said, “The reason for her leaving was not delay in the issuance of the visa but personal reasons.”“Her visa was renewed until the end of June so that she could cover elections and undertake other journalistic activities. Authority letters (only for access to polling booths and counting stations) cannot be processed while the visa extension was under process,” said the official.On the documentary, the official said it had been shot without appropriate permissions and glorified terrorism while providing a platform for extremists and lacking objectivity. The development saw 30 India-based foreign correspondents saying in a letter: “...though not technically expelling her, Indian authorities have effectively pushed out a foreign correspondent on the eve of an election that the government describes as the largest democratic exercise in the world”.","Avani Dias produced documentary Sikhs, Spies, and Murder.

Tragedy strikes IIT Kharagpur: Student found deceased in hostel room

To mark 50 years of association, Nandan Nilekani gives IIT-Bombay highest ever grant in India of Rs 315 crore

MUMBAI/DELHI: The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock this placement season at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages , students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.Organisations that would usually pick half-a-dozen students have picked one or two at best, forcing colleges to reach out to more companies.And many of those are offering annual compensation of Rs 10-15 lakh. Students who have bagged campus jobs at what they believe is a lower pay scale, are still in the market looking for better prospects on job portals and travelling cities to attend job fairs and interviews.""The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted the campus placements for the 2024 graduating batch of IIT Indore. The reduced hiring numbers of recruiters compared to the previous year have resulted in a challenging placement season. To offset the impact, IIT Indore has taken early steps by tapping into alumni networks and has broadened its pool of potential employers, including PSUs,"" said Professor Suhas Joshi, director, IIT Indore.A student at IIT Bombay said, ""Companies that till last year picked 5 to 8 students are picking 1 or 2 this year. Several are still not yet hired. From coaching classes to start-ups, some have recently been picked for salary packages of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 in phase 2.""Another student from an IIT-Kharagpur said, ""Spectrum Technologies offered Rs 3.6 lakh for trainee engineers and Rs 6 lakh for trainee design engineers. Startoon Labs and Gem Machinery offered Rs 5.5 lakh annually. Skyroot offered Rs 5 lakh. Sri Chaitanya and Next Education offer Rs 4.8 to 6 lakh per annum.""""The scenario now is that many students are taking up jobs offering the bare minimum threshold salary of Rs 6 lakh a year but are looking for other jobs,"" a source said. Students and placement office staff are trying to attract more companies, negotiating packages with NGOs, reaching out to job portals, and providing guidance to final-year students. Praveen Tyagi, owner of IITians' Pace, a tutorial for entrance tests, said, ""While AI has reduced jobs and international FANG companies did not come to the campus, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up talent. We conducted tests to hire IITians, and hundreds of them took our test. Students conducted mock online lectures, and those who had good communication skills were picked. We have offered 25 students Rs 12 lakh per annum.""At IIT Delhi, a significant number are still seeking employment through the Office of Career Services (OCS). As of April 5, out of 1,814 students registered with OCS, 1,083 have secured jobs, leaving approximately 40% yet to find employment.However, the situation appears more favorable for those in undergraduate programs (BTech+dual degree), with 81% of the 903 participants having received job offers. R Ayothiraman, professor-in-charge of OCS, mentioned plans to conduct separate placement drives specifically for PhD candidates.During recent placements, students at IIT-D were introduced to a variety of job roles. Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd proposed an annual package of Rs 19.5 lakh, while HCL Software offered Rs 21.9 lakh, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro presented annual packages of Rs 9 lakh and Rs 7 lakh respectively.The placement process at IIT Delhi is rigorous, with each phase lasting about 15 days. Students diligently prepare for interviews. ""We are mentally prepared for a set pattern of questions, but this time the companies were more demanding, seeking fewer candidates with specialized skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning for annual packages ranging from Rs 10-50 lakh,"" a student said, adding that he lacked the skills required because his interest lay in software development.","The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages, students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.

NEW DELHI: Everest Food Products on Tuesday issued a statement reassuring its customers that all its products are safe and of high quality, following concerns raised by Singapore and Hong Kong over one of its spice-mix products.The company clarified that Everest is not banned in either country, and only one out of its 60 products has been temporarily held for examination, which is a standard procedure and not a ban.""We reassure our customers that our products are safe and of high quality, so there is no need for concern,"" the company spokesperson said.""This is a standard procedure and not a ban.

Exports are cleared only after receiving necessary clearances & approval from the laboratories of the Spice Board of India.""Everest, a brand with over 50 years of experience, upholds strict hygiene and safety standards in its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, earning numerous national and international certifications, the spokesperson added.Meanwhile, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has begun collecting samples of spices in powder form of all brands, including MDH and Everest, from across India following concerns raised by Singapore and Hong Kong authorities.India has sought details about the matter from the food safety regulators of Singapore and Hong Kong as well as Indian embassies in both countries.The commerce ministry has also sought details from MDH and Everest.Everest mix spices came to the centre of the controversy after the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) in Hong Kong found ethylene oxide, a form of pesticide classified as carcinogen by The International Agency for Research on Cancer, in certain spice packs manufactured by MDH and Everest and has instructed vendors to stop sale of the products and remove them from retail shelves.While authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong have already initiated recall of Everest's fish curry masala as reported by TOI, MDH's Madras curry powder, sambhar masala, mixed masala powder, and curry powder have also been recalled by Hong Kong.Earlier, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) had recalled 'Everest' fish curry masala due to the presence of ethylene oxide, a pesticide that is not authorised for use in food beyond permissible limits and advised buyers against consuming it. The importer, Sp Muthiah & Sons, has been directed to recall the products, SFA said in a statement on April 18.In the 2022-23 fiscal, the country exported spices worth nearly Rs 32,000 crore. Chilli, cumin, spice oil and oleoresins, turmeric, curry powder and cardamom are major spices exported.","Singapore's food safety authority referred to Hong Kong's recall alert and asked the company's Singapore importer to recall and temporarily hold the product for further inspection.

'India must shine for all': What Congress said

What Congress' 2024 Lok Sabha manifesto says

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Modi, in his past few election speeches, has been relentless in his attack against the Congress over its manifesto promise of a ""nation-wide socio-economic and caste census."" PM Modi has accused the grand-old party of having ""plans to redistribute wealth"".The Prime Minister set the tone for this mega attack last Sunday at an election rally in Rajasthan where he linked Cong's manifesto plans with a 2006 statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on giving priority to minorities on nation's resources.Citing Manmohan Singh's 2006 speech, PM Modi has claimed that Congress, if voted to power, will take away people's wealth and redistribute it among the Muslims .""Earlier, when their (Congress) government was in power, they had said that Muslims have the first right on the country's assets. This means to whom will this property be distributed? It will be distributed among those who have more children,"" PM Modi had said at the Rajasthan rally .Since then, the Prime Minister has repeated this charge at all his election rallies. ""They have set their sights on your hard-earned money and property. Congress’s shahzada’ (prince) says if their govt comes to power, they will investigate who earns how much and has how much property, how many vehicles, your fixed deposits. Not only this, their govt will take over property and redistribute it. This is what their election manifesto is saying...,” he said at a rally in Aligarh.Reiterating his comments, PM Modi again on Monday said, ""Your Mangalsutra will not be safe under Congress rule,"" adding that Congress and INDI alliance have their eyes on the people's earnings and property.He made similar allegations on Tuesday at a rally in Rajasthan.""I have put forth the truth before the country that Congress is hatching a deep conspiracy to snatch your wealth and distribute it among the 'select' people,"" he said.Reacting strongly to PM's onslaught, Congress lodged a complaint with the EC seeking cancellation of PM Modi's candidature and stating that “this is not a candidate who will be silenced by a simple censure”.Calling PM Modi a ""serial offender"", Congress said that he attacked the dignity of the Constitution by violating the principle of secularism which is part of the basic structure.And while the political slugfest continues, let's have a look at what the then PM Manmohan Singh had actually said in 2006. The speech cited by PM Modi was given by Manmohan Singh in his address to the National Development Council on December 9.""I believe our collective priorities are clear. Agriculture, irrigation and water resources, health, education, critical investment in rural infrastructure, and the essential public investment needs of general infrastructure, along with programmes for the upliftment of SC/STS, other backward classes, minorities and women and children,"" he had said.""The component plans for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes will need to be revitalised. We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. They must have the first claim on resources"", he had further added.As Manmohan Singh's speech sparked a controversy , the then PMO released a statement on December 10, 2006.The statement clarified that ""first claim on resources"" didn't just refer to Muslims but all the ""priority"" areas including ""SCS, STS, OBCS, women and children and minorities.""""It will be seen from the above that the Prime Minister's reference to ""first claim on resources"" refers to all the ""priority"" areas listed above, including programmes for the upliftment of SCS, STS, OBCS, women and children and minorities,"" the statement said.""It may also be noted that these observations of the Prime Minister were made after referring to the very good performance of the Indian economy in recent months, and the expectation that the economy would continue to do well, creating new income and employment opportunities for all sections of society"", it added.Highlighting the need to pay special attention to the vulnerable sections of the society, the statement said, ""While better off sections of society will benefit from this process, it is the responsibility of the government to pay special attention to the welfare of weaker and marginalised sections.""""The Prime Minister has said on several occasions that 'India must shine, but shine for all'"", the statement clarified.With his ""mangalsutra"" remark, PM Modi said, ""The Congress manifesto says they will calculate the gold with mothers and sisters, get information about it and then distribute that property.""Responding to this, Congress said that although they have mentioned about economic disparities in their manifesto, it does not talk about 'redistribution' and that it favours a 'comprehensive socio-economic caste census'Congress in its 'Nyay Patra' has promised to conduct a comprehensive socio-economic caste census.""Congress will conduct a nation-wide socio-economic and caste census to enumerate the castes and sub-castes and their socio-economic conditions. Based on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for affirmative action"", the manifesto reads.""Congress will establish an authority to monitor the distribution to the poor of government land and surplus land under the legislations concerning land ceiling"", it says.""We will address the growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies"", it adds.","PM Modi has been relentless in his attack against the Congress over its manifesto promise of a ""nation-wide socio-economic and caste census"" PM Modi has accused the grand-old party of having ""plans to redistribute wealth"" He linked Cong's manifesto plans with a 2006 statement of former PM Manmohan Singh on giving priority to minorities on nation's resources.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109530751,imgsize-903736,width-400,resizemode-4/109530751.jpg"

Besides, sources argued, Ketki Devi's candidature would be seen as a boost to women leadership, one of the party's key poll planks.A Delhi court last week deferred its order on framing of charges against Singh. Six women wrestlers have accused him of sexual harassment - an allegation he has denied vehemently.The matter was deferred after Singh moved an application before the court seeking further probe into reports of his presence at the WFI office on September 7, 2022. He also said the prosecution's analysis of call detail records had shown that one incident of alleged sexual harassment took place on a day when he was not present in the country.However, the chances of Mahajan and Namgyal seem bleaker as per party sources, who attributed the likely exclusion to their ""non-performance"" as MPs and ""negative feedback"" from their constituencies. Polling on all three seats is scheduled in the fifth phase on May 20, for which last date to file nominations is May 3.Although the party has not disclosed Mahajan's replacement, some media reports suggested that senior advocate Ujjwal Nikam was among those being considered for the prestigious Mumbai North Central seat.Historically, the constituency was considered a stronghold of Congress. Later, BJP ally Shiv Sena made its presence felt with its nominees Vidyadhar Gokhale (1989), Narayan Athawale (1996) and Manohar Joshi (1999)winning from here.

Glaciers melting at unprecedented rates in Indian Himalayan region: Isro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/glaciers-melting-at-unprecedented-rates-in-indian-himalayan-region-isro/articleshow/109505281.cms,"The long-term changes in the Ghepang Ghat Glacial Lake area (Credit: Isro

BENGALURU: The Himalayan mountains , often called the “Third Pole” due to their vast glaciers and snow cover, are highly vulnerable to global climate change impacts both physically and societally. Isro Monday said that new research analysing decades of satellite imagery has revealed that glaciers across the Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates, leading to the significant expansion of glacial lakes .Research conducted worldwide has consistently shown that glaciers across the globe have been experiencing unprecedented rates of retreat and thinning since the onset of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.“...This retreat leads to the formation of new lakes and the enlargement of existing ones in the Himalayan region. These bodies of water, created by the melting of glaciers, are known as glacial lakes and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers in the Himalayan region. However, they also pose significant risks, such as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods ( GLOFs ), which can have devastating consequences for communities downstream,” Isro said in a statement on Monday.For the research, Isro used satellite data from 1984 to 2023, which shows that of the 2,431 glacial lakes larger than 10 hectares identified in 2016-17 across river basins, a staggering 676 lakes have grown markedly since 1984. This includes 130 lakes within India — 65 in the Indus basin, seven in the Ganga basin, and 58 in the Brahmaputra basin.The changes have been drastic, with 601 of the expanding lakes more than doubling in size. Ten lakes grew 1.5 to 2 times larger, while 65 expanded 1.5 times. The analysis found many of the bulging lakes at higher elevations, with 314 between 4,000-5,000 metres and 296 above 5,000 metres.The glacial lakes are categorised based on their formation process into four broad categories, namely Moraine-dammed (water dammed by moraine), Ice-dammed (water dammed by ice), Erosion (water dammed in depressions formed by erosion), and other glacial lakes.“Among the 676 expanding lakes, the majority of them are Moraine-dammed (307) followed by Erosion (265), other (96), and Ice-dammed (8) glacial lakes, respectively,” Isro said.One example is Ghepang Ghat lake in Himachal Pradesh, which has grown 178% larger from 36.49 to 101.3 hectares between 1989-2022 at a rate of nearly 2 hectares per year.As glaciers rapidly melt, the swelling lakes not only indicate monumental environmental changes but also elevate risks of glacial lake outburst floods that can unleash devastating flooding downstream into mountain communities.",Isro says glaciers across Indian Himalayan region have been melting at alarming rates. This has led to the significant expansion of glacial lakes in the region. The lakes are created by the melting of glaciers and play a crucial role as freshwater sources for rivers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109505315,imgsize-920633,width-400,resizemode-4/109505315.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As the Congress delays its candidate announcement in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi , incumbent BJP MP Smriti Irani has targeted Rahul Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra . Irani said that in her five years in office, she accomplished more for the constituency than Gandhi did in his 15-year tenure.These comments came after speculation stirred by Vadra's potential candidacy for the Amethi seat, traditionally held by the Congress and won by Irani in 2019.Amethi is scheduled to vote on May 20 during the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha polls .In a jocular tone, Irani remarked to a gathering in Amethi, '(brother-in-law is eyeing the seat, what will he (Rahul Gandhi) do?) There was a time when people travelling in buses would leave their handkerchief to mark their seat so that no one sits on it. Rahul Gandhi will also come to mark his seat with a handkerchief because his brother-in-law is eyeing this seat.'""Has this ever happened? Just 27 days left for the election, yet the Congress has not announced its candidate. Such arrogance. What I could achieve in five years for Amethi, Rahul Gandhi could not accomplish in 15,"" Irani added.Before her victory over Rahul in the 2019 election, he had held the Amethi seat for three consecutive terms. Historically, the seat has been represented by his parents Sonia Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, as well as his late uncle Sanjay Gandhi, and was regarded as a Congress stronghold.Gandhi, who is currently contesting from Kerala's Wayanad, was recently asked if he would also be the Congress candidate in Amethi. ""I will do whatever the party orders me,"" he replied.Earlier, Vadra sparked speculation by stating that the people of Amethi believe that if he contests there, ""they'll have the option of correcting their mistake of electing Smritiji"". ""I am sure they will ensure my victory by a huge margin if I contest,"" he expressed.Wayanad is set to vote on April 26, and the deadline for filing nominations for the Amethi Lok Sabha seat is May 3. This allows Gandhi to announce his nomination after the polling in Wayanad.Irani's campaign is currently in full swing, with her alleging that Gandhi will arrive in Amethi after April 26 and attempt to sow division among people on the basis of caste.""After the Wayanad voting on April 26, Rahul Gandhi will visit here to claim that Amethi is his family's domain and fuel caste-based tensions. Despite the Congress party declining the invitation for the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration ceremony, Rahul Gandhi will be observed visiting temples in Amethi. Thus, it's crucial to remain vigilant and cautious,"" she stated during a local gathering.Earlier this January, key Congress figures had abstained from attending the Ram Temple's consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, citing the BJP's politicization of the project.Irani has accused Gandhi of neglecting the issues of Amethi in Parliament, asserting that the people of the constituency didn't even have access to drinking water during his tenure as MP.","BJP MP Smriti Irani has targeted Rahul Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra.

misleading advertisements

beyond those for

Ayurveda products,

Supreme Court

on Tuesday sought response from the Centre and states on actions taken against other

FMCG companies

for luring people with

deceptive promotions

to consume their products.

A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Ahsanuddin Amanullah also decided to examine the unethical practice of doctors prescribing expensive and unnecessary medicines to patients for some consideration and asked the Indian Medical Association, the petitioner in the contempt case against Patanjali

and its promoters, to put its house in order and sought response on action taken against erring doctors.

IMA itself has been criticised in the past for endorsing products of big pharmaceutical companies.

“What are you doing to rein in those members of your association in the allopathic field is a question we need to ask you too,” the bench told senior advocate P S Patwalia who was appearing for IMA. “This is not going to be all just that there are FMCGs, there are you and your members who are prescribing medicines on the strength of recommendations made for which there is valuable consideration… If that’s happening, why should we not turn the beam at you?”

The court said FMCG firms cannot be allowed to take people of this country “for a ride”, particularly babies, children and senior citizens who consume their products and are more prone to

health risks

.

Observing that it is more concerned about the health of common people who fall prey to misleading advertisements, the bench said that its intention was not to target any one but to send a message that violation of law would not be allowed.

“We are not here to gun for a particular party, it is in the larger interest of the public on how they are being misled,” the bench said. It said that the purpose of the proceedings is to protect faceless people who consume medicines and other products under the impression created by misleading advertisements.

As the ambit of the proceedings got expanded, the court also arraigned the Centre’s consumer affairs department and the ministry of information and broadcasting as parties to the case along with all state licensing authorities under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, a law that regulates advertising of drugs and prohibits ads of medicines and remedies that claim to have magical properties.

Animosity between INDIA bloc’s bickering bedfellows in Kerala turned embarrassingly personal on Tuesday, with LDF’s Nilambur legislator P V Anvar asking for a DNA test on Congress’s Rahul Gandhi because he doubted if someone like the Wayanad MP could be a Gandhi-Nehru scion.“Rahul Gandhi has no right to use Gandhi surname. He has reached the level of a fourthclass citizen.Can such a person be born into the Nehru family? I doubt it,” Anvar, whose assembly seat is part of Wayanad LS constituency, said during a rally in Palakkad. Anvar’s salvo was in response to Rahul asking why central agencies were sparing CM Pinarayi Vijayan when two others — exJharkhand CM Hemant Soren and Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal – were already in jail.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said, “We think the insult had the tacit approval of Vijayan.”Anvar’s remarks , which came three days before all 20 LS seats in Kerala vote in the second phase, received CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s endorsement amid a backlash from Congress. “Rahul Gandhi was bound to get a reply for what he said. He is not beyond reproach,” the CM told reporters in Kannur, alluding to Rahul targeting him.Congress’ K C Venugopal termed the attack “shocking and detestable”, saying it amounted to “insulting Rajiv Gandhi , who sacrificed his life for the country”.Congress MLA A P Anilkumar said Congress-led UDF had lodged a complaint with EC and the state police chief. KPCC acting president MM Hassan demanded that police immediately file a case against Anvar, whom he called “the new avatar of Godse”.“His words are deadlier than Godse’s bullets that killed Gandhiji. Anvar made a remark that should never come from a people’s representative,” he said. The video of his speech is being aired on various (TV) channels...

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's focus Tuesday on Congress's efforts to introduce quota for Muslims marks a significant escalation of BJP's ""appeasement"" charge against the opposition party.PM fired the ""Muslim quota"" salvo while addressing a rally at Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan - his last engagement in the state for Lok Sabha polls - and said Congress has for long made separate efforts to implement Muslim quota despite the prohibition laid down on ""Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution"" on religion-based reservations.The attack came even as Congress was still angrily protesting against PM's remark at Banswara, also in Rajasthan, on Sunday that Congress's pitch for "" redistribution of assets "" was part of a plan to take away assets from people and distribute among people who, going by his predecessor Manmohan Singh's 2006 speech at the National Development Council, can only be Muslims.While Election Commission has started an inquiry into Congress's complaint that that Banswara speech was communal and, therefore, violative of the 'model code of conduct', PM Modi repeated the charge and rebutted Congress's protest about Singh's statement having been distorted, saying, ""I was present at the meeting of the NDC.""Going by indications, the PM's consecutive volleys could be part of a larger offensive against the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto for allegedly seeking to create an opening for Muslims not just in jobs and education, but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, even sports - something which might push the electoral contest from now on to the ""secular-communal"" terrain.Highlighting extracts from the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto, BJP said that it implied Muslim reservation. ""Point 3 of the Congress manifesto says 'encourage' minorities to take full advantage of opportunities but Point 6 says 'ensure' minorities receive 'fair share' on exactly the same issues as mentioned in Point 3,"" a senior BJP leader said and added, ""if Congress manifesto had limited itself to just 'encourage', then it would have been OK. But how will Congress ensure? Such language is employed when the intent is to back the promise with legislative action.""Congress manifesto in ""equity"" section says that it will do socio-economic census (different from caste census) and then basis this it will strengthen affirmative action (Point 1). Same section also says in Point 2 that the 50% limit on reservations will be raised. ""Read together, only one conclusion follows. Congress plans to install Muslim reservation - not just in education and jobs but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, cultural activities and even sports?"" the BJP leader said.Congress in its manifesto in 2009 Lok Sabha polls had promised nationwide reservation for Muslims in jobs and education. The idea was to create a Muslim sub-quota within the 27% OBC quota. Although it could not be implemented due to legal hurdles but Congress in its manifesto in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls again mentioned that the UPA govt had taken steps to address the condition of backward Muslims by aiming to provide them reservation in educational institutions and govt jobs and further added, ""We will pursue this matter closely in court to ensure that the policy is implemented through proper legislation"".The saffron party made a recall that Congress launched its pilot project to introduce Muslim quota in Andhra Pradesh after coming to power in 2004 when it made four attempts between 2004-10 to implement Muslim reservation. ""Each time the Andhra HC/SC quashed the pernicious attempts of Congress. Unashamed, the UPA then tried the Muslim reservation at ventral level in 2011. Even this attempt was stalled by Andhra HC in2012 and SC agreed with HC,"" a BJP leader said.In Karnataka, Congress promised to reinstate Muslim reservation that the BJP govt had scrapped. And finally in its 2024 manifesto, Congress talks of expanding affirmative action after socio-economic survey - breach 50% limit set by courts and ""ensure"" Muslims receive their ""fair share"" in jobs, education and even sports.""In UPA-1, Ranganath Mishra Commission recommended 10% reservation for Muslims, which Congress gave in Andhra despite being rejected by the high court. Congress removed all reservation of SC/ST OBC from AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia to provide for Muslims,"" said BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi.He said in Kashmir, Congress never allowed SC/ST and OBCs to have reservation in representation on the pretext that it is a Muslim majority state and the Muslim Waqf Board by law became the biggest land owner after the Govt of India, due to successive Congress-led govts.","PM fired the ""Muslim quota"" salvo while addressing a rally at Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan.

Why Supreme Court's nine-judge bench needs to interpret Article 39(b),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-scs-nine-judge-bench-needs-to-interpret-article-39b/articleshow/109542453.cms,"NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday commenced the process for interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution to determine whether this directive principle of state policy provision allows govt to treat and redistribute privately owned properties under the garb of ""material resources of the community"" for greater common good.The interpretation by a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih stems from Justice V R Krishna Iyer's dissenting view in Ranganatha Reddy case of 1977 that community resources included private properties and the conflation of the two in later judgments, leading to the matter being referred on Feb 20, 2002, for interpretation by a nine-judge bench.Article 39(b) provides that the state shall direct its policy towards securing ""that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"".Senior advocates Devraj, Zal Andhyarujina and Sameer Parikh argued that community resources could never include privately owned properties. Arguments will continue on Wednesday.The advocates termed Justice Iyer's view a reflection of his Marxist socialist ideology which had no place in a democratic country governed by a Constitution giving primacy to fundamental rights of citizens.Though the question is old, it is reverberating in current politically-surcharged atmosphere after Rahul Gandhi's speech at a public meeting on Saturday where he said, ""First, we will conduct a caste census... to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population.""PM Modi quickly reacted to this by alleging that Congress will take away private wealth of citizens for redistribution and juxtaposed it with the 2006 speech of ex-PM Manmohan Singh.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the sole question before the court was interpretation of Article 39(b) and not Article 31C, the provision which provides safe harbour to laws enacted in pursuance of the directive principles, whose validity as it existed prior to the 25th constitutional amendment in 1971 has been upheld by a 13-judge bench in Kesavananda Bharti case.CJI Chandrachud agreed and explained why Article 39(b) needed to be interpreted by a nine-judge bench. ""The reason for the exercise before the nine-judge bench is that though majority in the Ranganatha Reddy case in 1977 clarified that material resources of the community do not include private property, a five-judge bench in Sanjeev Coke in 1983 relied on Justice Iyer ignoring that it was a minority view,"" he said.""In the meantime, SC in Mafatlal Industries case in 1997 opined that Article 39(b) needed interpretation by a nine-judge bench,"" the CJI said. In the Mafatlal case, SC had said it was difficult to accept the broad view that material resources of the community under Article 39(b) covered what is privately owned.The bench asked how excess agricultural land was distributed among poor peasants in the 1960s. Devraj said no one questioned the state's power to acquire land for public purposes after paying a fair compensation to the owner of the land. Land ceiling laws were passed by states to determine excess land accumulated by zamindars and such excess land was then redistributed, he said.""But if govt wants to take away my property and distribute it to the poor, then I would be left with no money as my fees would be taken away and paid to poor people,"" he said in a lighter vein.",A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court has commenced the process for interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution.

PM Modi accused Congress on Tuesday of being “so steeped in vote-bank politics” that it wouldn’t baulk at snatching reservation from the SC and ST communities and passing it on to Muslims , “like it attempted to do through a pilot project in Andhra Pradesh in 2004 before seeking to extend it to the rest of the country”.“Between 2004 and 2010, they tried to implement this plan in AP four times, but because of legal hurdles, and Supreme Court’s vigil, they could not implement it,” Modi said at a rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk-Sawai Madhopur on the penultimate day of campaigning for the second and final phase of polling in the state this Friday.“In 2011, Congress tried to implement this across the country – snatch the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs as part of its politics of appeasement.a (The first thing we did after being elected was to scrap reservation for minorities that Cong had snatched from SC-ST).”Modi, who started his rally in Banswara last Sunday by linking Congress’s manifesto with former PM Manmohan Singh’s 2006 statement about minorities having first right to India’s resources, iterated that the grand old party had “hatched a conspiracy to redistribute the country’s wealth among a favoured few”.Singh featured in the PM’s speech a second time as the latter spoke of how Congress allegedly couldn’t care less about “tinkering with Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution”.“When the Constitution was being drafted, there was considerable opposition to reservation on the basis of religion. But Manmohan Singh gave a speech— I was present there as Gujarat CM — in which he said Muslims have the first right to the country’s wealth. This wasn’t a coincidence. Congress has always had an appeasement mentality,” Modi said. Repeating his statements on Congress eyeing “streedhan” and “mangalsutra” of “mothers and sisters”, Modi referred to Rahul Gandhi’s statements likening caste census to X-Rays and said the opposition party was talking about X-raying people’s properties and redistributing them.The PM said that by holding a mirror to Congress, he was merely trying to show the truth that the party was trying to hide.(When I exposed Congress’s vote-bank strategy two or three days ago, it hurt the party and its ecosystem so badly that whoever gets to speak only abuses Modi).The PM said wherever Congress was in office, it had become difficult to practice one’s faith. “Even listening to Hanuman Chalisa becomes a crime under the party’s governance,” he declared, alluding to an instance of a mobile storeowner in Bengaluru being assaulted last month for playing Hanuman Chalisa on a speaker.Modi alleged that when Congress governed Rajasthan, those who pelted stones on Ram Navami processions were given protection and restrictions imposed on such events. He promised none of this would happen again. “Now, you will recite Hanuman Chalisa peacefully and also celebrate Ram Navami. This is BJP’s guarantee.”The PM charged Congress with plunging places like Malpura, Karauli, Chhabra, Tonk and Jodhpur into “dange ki aag (fire of riots)” during the erstwhile Ashok Gehlot govt’s stint.","PM Modi accused Congress of being “so steeped in vote-bank politics’ that it wouldn’t baulk at snatching reservation from the SC and ST communities. “Between 2004 and 2010, they tried to implement this plan in AP four times, but because of legal hurdles, and Supreme Court’s vigil, they could not implement it,” Modi said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109542438,imgsize-27790,width-400,resizemode-4/109542438.jpg"

""When that is the case, non-wearing of helmet cannot be put against the deceased and contributory negligence cannot be attributed,"" the judge held, setting aside the tribunal's order.While fixing the compensation amount, the tribunal had considered the victim's notional income to be Rs 12,000 per month. Pointing out that the tribunal had failed to consider the victim's future prospects, the HC ruled that 40% of the notional income must be added towards future prospects, and ordered that the monthly pay of the student must be considered to be Rs 16,800. The court also granted Rs 1.2 lakh for loss of love and affection towards the family.","Madras high court rules that failure to wear a helmet cannot be treated as "" contributory negligence "" The family of a 21-year-old engineering student died in 2010 after his motorcycle hit a bus.

He highlighted several key reforms and measures taken byBJP govt, including nullification of Article 370 and introduction of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ). He emphasised that these steps have been instrumental in eliminating terrorism.Shah pointed out that when Congress was in govt terrorists from Pakistan often infiltrated and carried out attacks on Indian soil.

Syedna Saifuddin is Dawoodi Bohra spiritual head: Bombay high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/syedna-saifuddin-is-dawoodi-bohra-spiritual-head-bombay-high-court/articleshow/109542014.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday settled a 10-year-long legal battle over the question of succession to the Syedna, the spiritual leader of the million-plus Dawoodi Bohra community .A single judge bench of Justice Gautam Patel dismissed a suit filed in 2014 by the half-brother of the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq, claiming he had been appointed successor to the highest spiritual position for the Shia sect.The now deceased Khuzaima Qutbuddin had claimed that through direct, private communication he had been conferred 'nass'-the procedure by which a Dai declares his successor-in 1965. However, based on the evidence of witnesses, the court held the 'nass' conferred by the 52nd Dai on his own son Mufaddal Burhanuddin Saifuddin as the valid one.""I only addressed the question of proof, not faith,"" said Justice Patel, who has presided over the civil trial since 2014. Through a process marked by deposition of witnesses and cross-examination of both plaintiff and the defendant over the years, the verdict on who will assume the title of Syedna is intended to resolve the leadership to a spiritual order that dates back to the 12th century. The line is said to have begun in 1132 in Yemen. The HC had set out five issues in the suit, including the preliminary issue on whether it was maintainable. The court held that the suit was maintainable but did not accept the claim that 'nass' conferred on Qutbuddin via a private communication on Dec 10, 1965 was valid. A 'nass' is the bequest of a predecessor to his successor making him the next Dai for 1.5 million members of the Bohra community across the globe.The suit hearing had concluded in April 2023 and the judgment was reserved since then. Referring to the verdict, Justice Patel said, ""I have kept it as neutral as possible.""Counsel for the plaintiff, Taher Fakhruddin Qutbuddin, who had stepped in to pursue the case after his father's passing in 2016, Anand Desai and Samit Shukla, said they would analyse the judgment before taking any decision on what to do next. Taher Fakhruddin is a cousin of the present Syedna.The late Khuzaima Qutbuddin had originally filed the suit in 2014 after the death of the previous Syedna, claiming he was conferred 'nass' through direct communication on Dec 10, 1965 and that the then Dai had indicated this publicly in a sermon. Qutbuddin's lawyer Desai had submitted that the line of Imams and Dais is preordained and the names of each Imam and Dai are known to the Imam of the time. Besides, the custom of sajda-prostrating before the Dai- was practiced for almost 25 years before Syedna Qutbuddin by even the defendant among others, they argued. He cited prior instances to show private 'nass' sans witnesses was valid and an accepted doctrine in the community.After Qutbuddin passed away in 2016, his son, Taher Fakhruddin stepped in as the plaintiff to continue the legal battle and seek orders to declare himself as his father's successor and the 54th Dai. The final arguments began on Nov 28, 2022 after months and years of painstaking depositions by over 15 witnesses."," Bombay high court settles 10-year-long legal battle over the question of succession to the Syedna, the spiritual leader of the million-plus Dawoodi Bohra community.

Gujarat high court asks PCB to pay farmer Rs 20 lakh for its inaction that led to land degradation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-high-court-asks-pcb-to-pay-farmer-rs-20-lakh-for-its-inaction-that-led-to-land-degradation/articleshow/109541969.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The

Gujarat high court

has ordered Gujarat

Pollution Control

Board (GPCB) to pay a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to a farmer in Devbhoomi Dwarka district for the damage caused to his farmland because of pollution from a nearby soda ash plant.

Taking note of the fact that GPCB had failed to act on repeated complaints by the farmer, Balubha Ker of Karunga village, a bench of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee ordered the recovery of the amount proportionately from the board officials whose inaction led to the pollution.

The court also ordered the GPCB chairman to initiate an inquiry to fix responsibility on officials for their inaction.

Balubha had made several complaints on the pollution caused by the soda ash plant of RSPL Ltd in 2018. However, the board did not act despite finding that pollution by the factory had not only degraded the soil and raised salinity, but also made the groundwater toxic. Aggrieved by the inaction and laxity, Balubha moved the HC last year and showed the court how the plant discharged effluents into the Arabian Sea and how inadequate measures to control pollution had rendered his land infertile.

After the HC took the board to task for inaction, it inspected the place and issued a closure notice to the soda ash plant.

However, the court observed that GPCB had failed to perform its duties under the Water Act and the Air Act. ""The inaction on the part of the GPCB for more than three years, permitting the respondent company to continue the environmental pollution by releasing contaminated water into the petitioner's land, coal dusting in the surrounding area and solid waste kept undisposed, is writ large on the face of the record,"" the bench said.

Stating that GPCB ""cannot be permitted to act like this"", the judges ordered the board to compensate the farmer for ""damage caused to him, loss of his income from the land in question, mental harassment as well as the legal expenditure incurred in order to wake up GPCB from its slumber"".",Gujarat high court orders pollution control board to pay compensation to farmer.
