‘Indian’ who went from Olympic silver to Hollywood silver screen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-who-went-from-olympic-silver-to-hollywood-silver-screen/articleshow/111895944.cms,"In the winter of 1906, Olympic medallist Norman Pritchard was attending a dinner of London ’s hot and happening when he was requested to narrate the events of the dazzling Delhi Durbar of 1903. Norman spoke of “500 bejewelled and gold-encrusted elephants, its panoplied hosts, its array of Princes of unimaginable wealth,” wrote the New York Times in 1917; his account so vivid and flowing that fellow invitee Sir Charles Wyndham, a noted actor and theatre owner in England, asked him which theatre group he was associated with and for how long.Those days Norman was trading in jute in London without success. Which is why when Wyndham offered him work in the play ‘The Stronger Sex’, he promptly agreed for a salary of 80 shillings a week. In the coming years, the world of theatre and cinema would know him by the stage name he adopted, Norman Trevor. Within three months, his weekly wages had shot up to 12 pounds for ‘The Pocket Hercules’. Over the next few years, he would form his own theatre company in London, arrive in America in 1913, and become a theatre actor big enough for NYT to write two detailed profiles, ‘Chance and Norman Trevor’, and, ‘The Story of Norman Trevor’, in 1917. In the years that followed, he would also become a well-known Hollywood actor starring alongside the big guns of the silent era: Ronald Colman, Clara Bow and, yes, a very young Gary Cooper.In his own way, Norman was a crossover globetrotting star even before the term was born. And a unique one, too, because he reached the apex in both sports and performing arts. His transition from a world-class athlete to a successful actor is one of the most fascinating stories of individual accomplishment in modern India.An Athlete By Another NameInterestingly, none of the NYT ar ticles, including the obituary, mention his original surname, Pritchard, although they refer to his earlier life in India. A TOI report published after his death, however, says, “The death has been announced this week of Norman Trevor (his stage name), who will be better remembered in India under his real name, Norman Pritchard, as one of the finest athletes India has produced.”The first Asia-born athlete to win Olympic medals — silver in 200m and 200m hurdles in Paris 1900 — Norman has been claimed both by India and England. His brief biography on the International Olympic Committee’s website says, “The doyen of British Olympic historians, Ian Buchanan, notes that Pritchard was a member of an old colonial family and although he was born in India, he was indisputedly (sic) British. The Indian Olympic historian, Gulu Ezekiel, claims Pritchard based on his birth and the fact that he lived in India for many years.” However, the website also shows the Indian flag alongside, making Norman a representative of India. Even English newspapers and magazines of the time acknowledged his India background. The July 1900 issue of Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News compliments Norman as “a celebrated Anglo-Indian athlete who came to England in 1900”. It describes him as a “clean-limbed athlete and well over medium height”, adding that, good sprinter as he is, he is “even better over hurdles”. Reporting on one of his victories in 440 yards hurdles, The Field magazine (June 16, 1900 issue) called him “an Indian champion”.Calcutta ConnectionNorman’s childhood and youth was certainly Indian. Born in Calcutta in 1877, he went to St Xavier’s Collegiate School in the same city. His family owned a 5,000-acre plantation of tea, jute and indigo in Assam, says an NYT article. His sporting achievements in India — he was also good at rugby and football — are considerable and well-documented. But his transformation from a world-class sportsperson to a successful stage performer in London is less detailed. If his debut in theatre was a matter of chance, his success was an outcome of ability. One of his winning plays on the London theatre scene was ‘At the Barn’ (1912) with famous English singer-actor Marie Tempest, says NYT. He also played Horatio in ‘Hamlet’ and Orsino in ‘Twelfth Night’. Norman also had the streak of an entrepreneur and also became an actor-manager at the famed Savoy Theatre of London, producing his own shows. A constant mover and shaker, Norman established himself in New York with his acting in plays like ‘Margaret Schiller’, among others, but he truly arrived with J M Barrie’s wildly popular, ‘A Kiss for Cinderella’ (1916). NYT described his performance as a policeman as “one of the notable performances of the theatrical year”.A Hit In HollywoodA parallel move to Hollywood was natural. IMDB lists 28 films that featured Norman. ‘Beau Geste’ (1928) — French for ‘a noble act’ — was probably the biggest movie of his career. Based on a story by adventure novelist PC Wren, the film was advertised in TOI as “the love of three brothers who faced death for each other in the battle of life of the French Foreign legion in Africa”. The newspaper called it “one of the most striking films ever produced.” The film was also praised by Rangoon’s Burma News and The Ceylon Observer, Colombo. He also acted in at least one talkie, ‘Tonight at Twelve’ (1929), a film lost to history. Tragically, Norman was felled by “a brain malady” in California in late Oct, 1929. Per newspaper reports, he would imagine himself to be of “unlimited means”, but was actually a “destitute”. Norman once bought flowers worth $145 — roughly $2,500 or Rs 2 lakh today — for a young woman he hardly knew and was arrested for issuing cheques without sufficient money in the bank, NYT reported. This happened several times. What happened to the money earned as a stage actor and film star, one doesn’t know. The Lunacy Commission put him on parole on a promise by his close friends that he would be sent to a sanatorium. He recovered, but only briefly. He was 52.Norman’s obituaries were published even in faraway newspapers such as The Advertiser, Adelaide, underscoring the geographical breadth of his fame. The Sun, Auckland, noted that he had also received “a bronze statue for the best physique of athletes from among all nations at Paris”. The Olympian and Hollywood actor’s 150th birth anniversary falls three years from now. In a sense, his life bridges India and England. He provides an early connection with America, too.Both Norman Pritchard, the athlete, and Norman Trevor, the actor, must be celebrated by all.","Norman Pritchard was the first Asia-born athlete to win Olympic medals.

‘Work with marginalised communities has taken a hit in recent years’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/work-with-marginalised-communities-has-taken-a-hit-in-recent-years/articleshow/111895918.cms,"Ingrid Srinath, a civil society advocate and director of Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University, speaks to TOI on the impact of changes in govt rules on the NGO sectorQ Are there any firm figures on the shrinking of the non-profit sector in India? By how much has funding decreased?No reliable data is available on this. Since the home ministry stopped access to the FCRA data , we are reliant on occasional mentions in Parliament for updates.We can say that the impact includes a complete block on any overseas funding for policy research, advocacy, campaigning and rights-based programmes. This is exacerbated by domestic funders — of which, very few were anyway inclined to support such work — also withdrawing their limited support. There have been huge budget cuts at organisations that played an intermediary role, enabling smaller, more remote NGOs and those who work on areas not popular with Indian funders, to access international funding. There’s no public data on the extent of these cuts but I estimate these to be between 1/3rd and 2/3rd, based on conversations with affected organisations. Certain domains of work, especially those critical to protecting rights, critiquing policies, amplifying marginalised and minority voices and defending democratic freedoms are simply no longer feasible.Q What kinds of grassroots work have been disrupted? What might be unsafe causes, and where is this money being redirected to?Particularly negatively affected is work with marginalised communities — minorities, Dalits, tribals, people with disabilities, HIV AIDS, LGBTQIA+, commercial sex workers, unorganised labour, gender equity as well as any work that takes a rights-based approach as opposed to one based on charity. Resources are mainly being focused on ?lling the gaps in public services by substituting philanthropy for public spending in the last-mile and low-cost services. We are, as a nation, unable to fathom what is really happening policy-wise and freedom-wise due to the lack of reliable, timely data. We’re unable to voice any criticism of these policies. We cannot organise to seek accountability, transparency or even basic information. We cannot monitor the working of our elected representatives or public of?cials and institutions.","Ingrid Srinath, director of Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University, speaks to TOI on the impact of changes in govt rules on the NGO sector.

The great indian NGO downsize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-great-indian-ngo-downsize/articleshow/111895882.cms,"When TISS terminated over 100 staffers, after the Tata Education Trust withdrew funding (laterrenewed), it dragged the spotlight again to the volatility and turmoil in India’s philanthropies and nonprofits . A few days later, the parent trust of the Centre for Financial Accountability had its FCRA licence revoked. Many of India’s highest-profile NGOs and thinktanks are now in dire straits, as are the human lives they touched.Over the last three or four years, the sector has been forced to jump administrative hoops and bled of funds, compelled to lay off workers and withdraw wholesale from many areas. It’s tough to quantify how hard the sector has been hit because there is no accurate database of civil society organisations , given the definitional vagueness of the term — ranging from small grassroots groups to big umbrella networks, faith-based organisations, research bodies, social movements, youth groups and so on.In 2012, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (Mospi) conducted the largest exercise of its kind to map nonprofit organisations (NPOs). It counted 31.7 lakh NPOs based on registration records till 2008 and traced 6.94 lakh live NPOs through a physical exercise conducted in 2009-10. In November 2022, the Income Tax Department released a list of 2.52 lakh taxexempt NPOs of which 1.64 lakh NPOs had valid registration to offer tax deductions to donors. NGOs are financially dependent on external grants and the state has long been vigilant about foreign interference in India and politics, enacting the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act in 1976 for NGOs.The Big FCRA PurgeThe act has been through several amendments, and all govts have scrutinised foreign contributions and their purposes. The UPA govt was also suspicious of NGOs, cancelling FCRA licences after the anti-nuclear Kudankulam protests. However, the most drastic use of the law began in 2020. All charitable trusts and institutions had to revalidate their registration with the tax department. New compliance burdens were added, including GST obligations, a cap on administrative expenses drawn from foreign funds at 20% and mandatory bank accounts at a specific SBI branch. Then, in September 2023, India amended the FCRA again in a big way. Most consequentially, these amendments banned subgranting to smaller entities. In one swift hack, this cut off funds from grassroots civil society organisations which depended on these well-connected larger NGOs to implement their work. Some NGOs have faced tax raids and moneylaundering allegations.“When the attacks on Greenpeace and Amnesty happened, we thought it was because they had been too confrontational with the govt. With Lawyers’ Collective or the Ford Foundation and Teesta Setalvad, it could have been a personal grudge. With Oxfam, perhaps their inequality reports rankled, or their work in Assam. However, NGOs like Care India worked with the govt and were absolutely non-adversarial, but their licence was suspended over administrative quibbles,” says a non-profit official who preferred to stay anonymous. This is a wider, “systemic attack” on the sector, he concludes. The govt says the changes in FCRA were needed to stop “misuse” of foreign money. Following the 2020 amendments, home minister Amit Shah said it had paved the way for effective monitoring to check organisations involved in anti-national activities, religious conversions, political opposition to development projects or propaganda against govt policies. “You spell out your objectives, give details of your programme and get your accounts audited. What’s the problem in this?” he said at a summit organised by a media house.The NGO sector ’s view and the state’s perspectives have diverged, acknowledges Sudarshan Suchi, CEO of Bal Raksha Bharat (Save the Children). “While NGOs have always been on tenterhooks, the uncertainty is now sharper as donor commitments have turned into projects lasting less than a year,” he says. Bal Raksha Bharat’s FCRA renewal was denied in July 2023, and they have filed a fresh application. They had offices in 18 states, and almost half of their grants were from foreign donors. They had to let go of projects and people. It hit health and education projects in Uttarakhand and Gujarat, said Suchi. According to home ministry’s FCRA division, as of July 19, 2024, there were 15,958 active associations with FCRA while 14,798 were deemed expired and 20,707 cancelled.Looking HomewardsWith foreign funding hobbled, NGOs have turned to Indian donors but that route has its own obstacles. Indian corporations above a certain size are required to spend 2% of their profits on social causes. This corporate social responsibility (CSR) law has been amended several times, shifting the focus from spending to using. Non-profits now have to return money unused during the fiscal year (unless they’re using it for an ongoing project for a maximum of three years), and companies have to pass this on to PM Cares or the PM Relief Fund. There are new boundaries on exactly how CSR money can be spent and higher compliance requirements and penalties for corporations. “After full tax exemption for NGO donations was removed in 2014-15, the incentives for donors reduced,” says Mathew Cherian, an NGO veteran who has played leading roles in HelpAge India and Care India. “Section 80G of the Income Tax Act allows for a 50% exemption, but not above Rs 60,000. Anonymous donations are taxed at 30%,” he says. “Most CSR money goes to the company’s own NGOs or foundations, or within their own geographic regions,” says another non-profit professional. “They’re more in the space of charitable giving, rather than working on issues of social exclusion or rights,” he adds.The state’s antipathy towards NGOs has had a chilling effect on local giving too. “Most philanthropists in India run ongoing businesses. So now, they have also started asking non-profits about their FCRA status. This has no legal bearing on local donations, but they use FCRA as a cue to see where you stand with the govt,” says a senior non-profit professional. Informally, there are new strings attached, explains a communications professional who assists NGOs with outreach and CSR. “One of our clients, with 10 sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh, would contribute small amounts to causes in Kolkata, where they were headquartered. But they were instructed by the state administration that most of their CSR funding should be directed to UP since that’s where they make their money,” he says.The Direct FalloutOne development professional estimates tens of thousands of layoffs in the sector, factoring in job losses at partner organisations. All big international NGOs are being hit, as are think-tanks such as Centre for Policy Research or the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, which the govt itself worked with. Those that worked in advocacy or influencing are in trouble, as is any organisation with Christian or Muslim connections, says the communications professional. This includes NGOs like World Vision, whose fundraising may be faith-based but not its work. Headquartered in the UK, with a 70-year presence in India, World Vision had its FCRA licence cancelled in October 2022. This forced 80% of its projects to close, shrinking its operations to a tenth of its former size, says a source at the organisation, who did not wish to be named. “We used to be the first to respond to any disaster in the country. That has stopped,” said the source. In Bengal, World Vision had set up groups that helped tackle trafficking of young girls. “Without funding, they’ve gradually dissolved. With this grassroots protection net cut off, North 24 Parganas — a trafficking hotbed in the country — is vulnerable again,” says the source, adding, “It’s the communities at the receiving end that are suffering the most.” Oxfam had Rs 170 crore going to communities, which has now stopped. A non-profit that once ran on a Rs 400-crore budget is now reduced to Rs 10 crore. They are unable to pay vendors for projects, including providing 13 lakh goats to vulnerable families. “The FCRA cancellation happened around the time we were supposed to pay them, and because of the guidelines, we couldn’t. Now, we owe crores to these vendors,” says a source at the non-profit.Looking AheadFCRA renewals are only a part of the challenges, says Harsh Jaitli, CEO of the Voluntary Action Network of India (VANI), an apex body of about 650 civil society organisations, with connections to about 10,000 organisations around the country. “NGOs have also failed to communicate the impact of these measures to the public, so those creating negative perceptions have not been adequately countered,” he says. To bridge this trust deficit with the state, a coalition of NGOs put together a report called ‘India’s Million Missions’, to showcase the vital role NGOs have played in independent India. “Civil society has, and continues to, play a significant role in being that ‘last mile’ connection to reach the unreached. The Covid-19 pandemic is an example. Data shows they contribute nearly 2% to the GDP and provide employment at all levels, from those steering projects down to the volunteers,” says Cherian. And yet, tax rules have been made more complex. For instance, fundraising expenditure is not included in charitable activity, so there are no longer any donations for this work, he points out. “NGOs are being pushed towards service-delivery roles like running schools and clinics, rather than acting as watchdogs,” a professional working in participatory development observes.With inputs from Ambika Pandit, Mohua Das, Saibal Sen and Rakesh Prakash","Many of India’s highest-profile NGOs and thinktanks are now in dire straits, as are the human lives they touched.

"Sec 377 defanged, many homosexuals trapped in hetero marriages take divorce route out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sec-377-defanged-many-homosexuals-trapped-in-hetero-marriages-take-divorce-route-out/articleshow/111895011.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'In small towns, families still take cover of hetero marriages'

When Raman Shah, a 50-year-old Mumbai businessman, mustered the courage to come out of the closet and walk out of a long-term marriage , he was forced to move to another country. Homosexuality was still a crime. As soon as the Supreme Court struck down Section 377 , he moved back to India and got legally divorced.""I come from a very conservative family and most of them still do not accept me,"" says Shah (name changed on request).""But at least I know I am not a criminal and cannot be prosecuted. I can meet friends openly and be myself.""In a society where marriage is still considered a rite of passage, a combination of heteronormative factors - parental pressure, societal norms, denial - had made many gay individuals step into matrimony. But after the 2018 Supreme Court order decriminalised homosexuality and honoured LGBTQ rights, more and more people are emboldened to come out and file for divorce. Interestingly, no matrimonial law mentions sexual preference as grounds for divorce , forcing lawyers to creatively describe the reasons for the annulment.""A lot of people had not come out of the closet until 377 was read down, so this judgment has definitely been a great anchor,"" says Devika Deshmukh-Doshi, a Mumbai family law practitioner who has represented several such cases of people in their forties - mostly where one person is gay and had concealed it.In some cases, the gay partner has chosen to opt out. In others, the spouse found out and pushed for a divorce. There are also cases where a gay person comes out but continues to stay within the marriage, with the understanding that the partners would lead separate lives.Some stay good friends and support each other - like a couple where the wife herself brought her introvert gay husband to Gulabi Mela, an annual LGBTQ celebration held in Shivaji Park. Interestingly, gifted mathematician Shakuntala Devi was married to a homosexual man, and had written a book called 'The World of Homosexuals' in 1977 in which she described, with great compassion, the struggles of being gay. She remained friends with him all through.Today, things are changing, especially among younger people for whom the 'D' word does not translate into dread. ""I now have many more friends choosing themselves over marriage,"" says 27-year-old Mumbai doctor Pranav Patil (name changed on request), who came out after his mother inundated him with marriage proposals. ""The trauma of the law has gone and now people are creating a whole new blueprint for their lives. Gay people who got married are also seeing others come out so there is a snowball effect."" He adds with a twinkle, ""Now I have told my mother that I would like to have an arranged marriage only, but to a man."" (Last year, a five-judge SC bench unanimously ruled against legalising same sex marriage, leaving it to Parliament to decide.) Some people knowingly opt for a 'lavender marriage' - an arrangement or understanding that honours the non-sexual aspects of marriage, such as companionship, raising children or looking after elders. In fact, Patil says, ""Even after I announced I was gay, I have received three serious proposals from women.""Although pride rainbows have long spread their affirming colours across the globe, India's acceptance of homosexuality is still wobbly. Families in smaller towns continue to hide behind the tinsel charade of heterosexual marriage. A recent arranged marriage between a young man and woman in Jaipur, followed by a seven-day-long big fat Indian wedding, ended in a mutually consensual divorce within a year when the young bride found that her husband had zero interest in her and would disappear for long inexplicable stretches of time, evoking the iconic 2005 Ang Lee film, 'Brokeback Mountain'.Matrimonial lawyers say couples come to them with complicated cases - a wife may have found pictures of men on her husband's phone, or a man discovers that his wife's 'best friend' is actually her gay partner. Many are still not comfortable coming out to their parents, or to work colleagues, so they would rather not allow the case to drag on, and close the chapter with divorce by mutual consent.In cases of mutual consent, partners are not required to state a reason. It is when the divorce is contentious that it gets complicated, for outdated matrimonial laws - whether the Hindu Marriage Act or the Muslim Personal Law or the Special Marriage Act - drafted in the fifties make no mention of homosexuality as grounds for divorce, forcing family court lawyers to tiptoe around facts.Adultery is very difficult to prove, say lawyers. ""Since I cannot say the spouse has a different sexual preference, or I don't want to mention that the person is gay, I would have to make out a case of mental cruelty or a case of secrecy or fraud - ('I have noticed is that he hides his phone from me or travels with someone and conceals his locations') - which can be deemed as an emotional affair resulting in a sustained form of cruelty,"" says Deshmukh-Doshi.She adds it is unfortunate that while sexual preference has not been recognised as grounds for divorce, the laws still allow divorce on the grounds of 'changing your religion' or 'suffering from a mental disorder'.""If you are taking a call to come out of the closet to your spouse and/or children and file for divorce, you should strengthen yourself and know that people might respond in different ways,"" suggests LGBTQ inclusion activist Parmesh Shahani, author of 'Queeristan'. ""It's useful to seek counselling from a queer affirmative mental health expert as you navigate this. You don't have to be alone on the journey, "" added Parmesh.","After the 2018 Supreme Court order decriminalised homosexuality and honoured LGBTQ rights, more and more people are emboldened to come out and file for divorce.

Disabled candidate not given any service despite clearing UPSC 4 times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disabled-candidate-not-given-any-service-despite-clearing-upsc-4-times/articleshow/111895006.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'Cerebral palsy allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy?

In the midst of the row over trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar allegedly misusing the disability quota, a case has surfaced of a candidate with muscular dystrophy being denied any service despite having cleared the civil services four times.Kartik Kansal, who studied mechanical engineering in IIT Roorkee, is currently a scientist in Isro, a post for which he was selected through all-India central recruitment.Kartik, who has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14, was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829).In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS, since that year those ranked 272 and 273 got IAS. However, in 2021, muscular dystrophy was not included in the list of conditions in functional classification eligible for IAS.Muscular dystrophy was included in the list for Indian Revenue Service (income Tax) Group A and Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise), which were his second and third choices.In 2019, when Kartik Kansal got 813 rank, he could easily have been allotted a service as there were 15 vacancies for locomotor disability and only 14 were filled. In 2021, there were seven vacancies in the locomotor disability category and only four were filled. He ranked number one in the category.The medical board in AIIMS certified that he had muscular weakness and both his arms and legs were affected by muscular dystrophy. Inexplicably, for IAS, persons with both arms and legs affected are eligible but persons with muscular dystrophy are not. The board noted that he ""can do manipulation with fingers with difficulty and can do mobility with motorised wheelchair"". It also certified that he could see, hear speak, communicate, read and write though he could not stand, walk, pull, push, lift, crouch, bend, kneel, jump or climb. Though his original disability certificate put his level of disability at 60%, the AIIMS medical board deemed it 90%.A retired IAS officer, Sanjeev Gupta, took up Kartik's cause and tweeted in his support pointing out that it was a travesty of justice that Kartik who wrote the civil services without even using a scribe except for help in going to the toilet, and who met all the physical requirements for the job of IAS and IRS was not given any service.When he sought the reason for rejection through the central portal for grievance redressal, he got a reply stating: ""PWBD candidates are allocated service as per the functional classification and physical requirements prescribed by different cadre controlling authorities. There were no matching services at your turn as per your rank.""""Why should functional classifications and physical requirements for similar nature of work vary across services? If cerebral palsy is allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy? Thankfully, since 2024 everything has been merged into one. There will be no such errors now. As per the new merged criteria too, Kartik is eligible to get IAS and true justice will be done by giving him IAS if there is a carry forward vacancy from previous years. This will partly undo the injustice meted out to him till now,"" said Gupta.""By joining the civil services, I wanted to prove that even people like me can do it. But I cannot comment further on the issue since it is sub judice,"" said Kartik, whose case pertaining to this issue is pending in Central Administrative Tribunal.","Kartik Kansal has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14.

"Working towards launching 4G/5G services on BSNL/MTNL ""at the earliest"": Scindia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-towards-launching-4g/5g-services-on-bsnl/mtnl-at-the-earliest-scindia/articleshow/111843450.cms,"NEW DELHI: Promising to launch 4G and 5G services in BSNL and MTNL “at the earliest”, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday said the turnaround efforts of the state-run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis, “and not monthly or weekly”.The minister also said that the govt stands behind the Sovereign Guarantee Bonds of MTNL, and there will be no defaults, even as its operations will be transferred to BSNL.“What we have said is very clear that MTNL’s operations will be transferred to BSNL. Monetisation of assets will take place to pay off the liabilities. In the interim of monetisation of assets and some bonds getting due, the sovereign guarantee bonds stand good. Government of India stands behind those bonds and there will be no default.”Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress curtain-raiser event here, Scindia said despite delays, people should have “national pride” and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies and not something which is sourced from foreign vendors.“Develop a sense of national pride… The easy for us would have been to pick up technologies (from global vendors), and do what others do. But we feel that India must not be just a supplier of services, but also of products. So, we chose the harder way, and decided to develop the India 4G stack ourselves.”A consortium of Tata-run Tejas and TCS and public sector C-DOT has been working on the complex technologies to develop 4G and 5G telecom infrastructure that will be deployed on BSNL and MTNL networks. “Let me guarantee. We are on track to deploy one lakh RANs (radio access networks) towards this effort.”Scindia said efforts of the govt have been to develop technologies within India which will be used not only for domestic use, but also for exports. “From hardly anything a decade back, export of telecom equipment last year was to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.”The minister also said that the govt wants to be a facilitator in enabling the growth of the sector, against acting as a regulator. He said after leapfrogging and witnessing rapid growth in 5G, India is now working to be a leader in the development of 6G technologies. “A country that followed the world in 4G, walked with it in 5G, will now lead when it comes to 6G.”Scindia said that India is now working on encouraging the development of apps and solutions for 5G that would be deployed in rural areas.On cybersecurity, the minister said that as India develops on the digital front, there is a looming threat on the front of cyber security. “Wars today are not only fought on land, but also on the cloud. It is important to protect the country, the citizens, and businesses when it comes to cybersecurity.”","Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said turnaround efforts of state- run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis. He said despite delays, people should have ‘national pride’ and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111843467,imgsize-776618,width-400,resizemode-4/111843467.jpg"

The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick.

This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

But courage can be contagious, too. That, too, is what it means to be an American...If you're at home and you disagree with everything I just said, our message to you is this: We will still defend to the death your right to say it, because that is who we are as Americans,"" said Ramaswamy, who had exited the presidential race earlier this year.He highlighted the opportunity for Americans to hold differing opinions yet come together peacefully, stating, ""We are the country where we can disagree like hell and still get together at the dinner table at the end of it.

""The media has tried to convince you for decades that Republicans don't care about your communities.

Would a man reduce his sugar levels at night? Which is very dangerous.

Soon, the student's NEET and HSC science results with the same first, middle and last names began circulating on some social media accounts.The stark contrast between the two sets of results - the exceptional NEET score alongside the board exam score of just 352 out of 700 - caught widespread attention.While sources have confirmed the validity of the results, TOI has not yet been able to independently verify that the marksheets belong to the same individual.Top sources in Ahmedabad's education circles revealed that the girl had been enrolled in Classes 11 and 12 at a coaching class, registering as a ""dummy"" student at a local school associated with the coaching centre in Ahmedabad's Science City area.According to the board mark sheet, the student scored only 21 in physics, 31 in chemistry, 39 in biology and 59 in English, and in total got 352 out of 700, and failed the Class 12 exams.School sources confirmed that her parents, who are doctors, were called to discuss her poor results. The coaching centre where she was enrolled mentioned that she dropped out two months into her studies during Class 12.Due to her status as a dummy student, the school had limited information about her academic engagement.When the NEET-UG results were announced, school authorities were stunned to find that the girl had scored 705 marks, placing her among the top performers in the state.Her NEET scores showed 99.8 percentile in physics, 99.1 percentile in chemistry and 99.1 percentile in biology, with an overall percentile of 99.9.It's a high score that would typically pave the way to medical college. However, experts pointed out a significant snag: her failure to clear the exams means she will not meet the eligibility criteria for medical college admissions, which requires at least 50% marks.","A student from Gujarat aced the NEET-UG with an impressive 705 out of 720.

"Gonda accident: Cloth pieces used to fasten railway track, says preliminary probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gonda-accident-cloth-pieces-used-to-fasten-railway-track-says-preliminary-probe/articleshow/111891263.cms,"LUCKNOW: A preliminary probe into the Thursday's derailment of Chandigarh-Dibrugarh Express (15904) conducted by a six-member team of railway officials has found cloth pieces were used with at least 72 elastic rail clips to fasten the rail track . The team blamed the engineering department for the derailment. One member of the panel, however, disagreed with the opinion, while a railway spokesperson said the findings were premature.Elastic rail clips (ERC) which are better known as pandrol clips are used to fasten the rail with concrete sleepers in order to bring stability while high speed trains cruise on the track.The 18 page joint note read, towards Gorakhpur side at 638/8-10 km, cloth pieces were inserted to fasten the rail with 72 clips. Further 140 clips were found in loose condition, 38 were out from their position and 10 were missing.Similarly, 102 rubber pad which is used to create grip between concrete slipper and metal rail track were found missing, while 88 were out of their position.Prior to the derailment, the train was cruising at 80 kmph. In the accident , four passengers were killed and around 29 were injured.“The fastening of the rail track was not proper, so the rail track was not secure,” the report, written in Hindi, said.The investigation team’s report said that the senior section engineer, ultrasound fault detection team, detected an IMR defect (immediate removal defect) at 1.30 pm and the Chandigarh-Dibrugarh Express crossed Motiganj station at 2.28 pm.It said that at 2.30 pm, the station master of Motiganj was given a memorandum to put a speed restriction of 30 kmph for trains to cross the defective spot.“When IMR was detected (at 1.30 pm), the site should have been protected till the caution order was served but it was not done due to which the train derailed. The engineering department is responsible for it,” the joint probe said.Meanwhile P K Singh, the senior section engineer representing the engineering department, who was part of the six-member team for the preliminary finding, wrote a dissent note.“I completely disagree with the joint note. It was incorrect to conclude that the site 638/16-14 km was not protected, because the IMR spot was completely fine and it was not the reason for the derailment,” he wrote.Singh concluded that the train derailed because of improper braking by the loco pilot.Pankaj Kumar Singh, CPRO, North Eastern Railway, said, “This joint note is not a finding of the train derailment, but a preliminary report which tells us how bad the condition of the accident site was. The actual finding would be done by the commissioner of railway safety (CRS), where every stakeholder will explain their part.”The CRS will start an investigation into the derailment on Sunday.Meanwhile, a member of the Railway Board told TOI on the condition of anonymity, “According to the joint note, it seems to be gross negligence in the maintenance of the track. However, it’s also true that several engineers across many divisions have time and again said that there is either no fund or miniscule fund for track renewal.”Another senior official said, “When IMR detected, three days are given to change the defected rail track with a new one. However, by rule book, a caution memo should be issued as soon as possible to operate the train at 20-30 kpmh on the affected track, which was apparently not followed in this case.”","Preliminary probe finds cloth pieces were used with at least 72 elastic rail clips to fasten the rail track.

"'Erroneous, misleading': Centre rejects study claiming 11.9 lakh excess Covid-19 deaths in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/erroneous-misleading-centre-rejects-study-claiming-11-9-lakh-excess-covid-19-deaths-in-india/articleshow/111886707.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry has criticized a recent study published in the US-based academic journal Science Advances., which claimed that India experienced significant excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, terming it ""erroneous"" in nature.The study claimed that India experienced 17 per cent higher or 1.19 million more deaths in 2020 than the previous year, which is eight times higher than the official number of Covid deaths in India and 1.5 times higher than the World Health Organization's estimates.The ministry stated that the study's estimates are ""untenable and unacceptable"" and that the methodology used by the authors has critical flaws.One of the main issues raised by the ministry is that the authors used a subset of households from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) conducted between January and April 2021, comparing mortality rates in these households in 2020 with those in 2019, and then extrapolated the results to the entire country.""The paper published today is methodologically flawed and shows results that are untenable and unacceptable,"" the statement said.The ministry argued that the NFHS sample is only representative of the country when considered as a whole, and the 23% of households included in the analysis from 14 states cannot be considered representative of the entire nation.Another critical flaw highlighted by the ministry is the potential selection and reporting biases in the sample due to the timing of data collection, which coincided with the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.The ministry also refuted the paper's claim that the vital registration system in low and middle-income countries, including India, is weak. The ministry stated that India's Civil Registration System (CRS) is highly robust, capturing over 99% of deaths, with reporting consistently increasing from 75% in 2015 to over 99% in 2020.The ministry further noted that the excess deaths reported in the CRS are not solely attributable to the pandemic, as the increase in death registration is also due to an increasing trend in CRS coverage and a larger population base in the succeeding year.""It is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the 'Science Advances' paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate,"" the statement said.The ministry also pointed out that the paper's results on age and sex are contrary to research and program data on Covid-19 in India.The paper claimed that excess mortality was greater in females and younger age groups, particularly children aged 0-19 years. However, data on recorded Covid-19 deaths and research from cohorts and registries consistently show higher mortality in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups.The ministry stated that the all-cause excess mortality in India in 2020 compared to the previous year is markedly less than the 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper.","The study claimed that India experienced 17 per cent higher or 1.19 million more deaths in 2020 than the previous year.

"12 lakh excess deaths in Covid year, estimates study; govt says methodology flawed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-lakh-excess-deaths-in-covid-year-estimates-study-govt-says-methodology-flawed/articleshow/111894804.cms,"Health min mum on paper's claims on SC/STs, Muslims

Researchers from several universities, including Oxford, have used mortality data from the National Family Health Survey 2019-21 to estimate that there were almost 12 lakh excess deaths in 2020, eight times the official number of Covid-19 deaths in India that year. The health ministry has dismissed the estimate as ""gross and misleading"" and criticised the study for flawed methodology.According to the study published in open access journal Sciences Advances, the authors found that in the subsample they studied, there was a reduction in life expectancy at birth of 2.6 years between 2019 and 2020, larger than reductions documented in any high-income country.This reduction was substantial even relative to trends in India: overall life expectancy at birth in 2020 was equivalent to all-India levels over a decade earlier.Relative to the 1.3-year life expectancy loss among high-caste Hindus, the loss for Muslims was 5.4 years.Union health ministry Saturday criticised the methodology of taking a subset of households included in the NFHS survey between Jan and April 2021, and comparing the mortality in these households in 2020 with 2019, and then extrapolating the results to the entire country. ""The NFHS sample is representative of the country only when it is considered as a whole. 23% of households included in this analysis from part of 14 states cannot be considered representative of the country. The other critical flaw is related to possible selection and reporting biases in the included sample due to the time in which these data were collected, at the peak of Covid-19 pandemic,"" countered the ministry in its statement.The study found that the decline in life expectancy was similar in rural and urban India with a greater decline for marginalised social groups like women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and Muslims. Relative to the 1.3 year life expectancy loss among high caste Hindus, the loss for Muslims was 5.4 years, for STs 4.1 years and for SCs 2.7 years, stated the paper. ""In 2020, Muslim life expectancy was the lowest across the five social groups, a result of the fact that Muslims observed the greatest declines in life expectancy at birth between 2019 and 2020,"" stated the paper attributing this to ""further marginalisation of Muslims in 2020"".While health ministry's statement in reaction to the paper did not comment on the findings regarding Muslims, SCs and STs, it pointed out that the paper's claim about excess mortality being greater in women and younger age groups was contrary to data on 5.3 lakh recorded deaths due to Covid as well as research data from cohorts and registries consistently showing higher mortality due to Covid among men and in older age groups.Health ministry added that excess mortality during the pandemic meant an increase in deaths due to all causes, and could not be equated with deaths that were directly caused by Covid-19.The paper stated that the increase in all-cause mortality in 2020 could be due to deteriorating economic conditions and pandemic disruptions to public health services such as childhood immunizations, tuberculosis treatment, and hospital births identified in earlier research papers. Health ministry argued that SRS data in 2020 showed very little, if any, excess mortality compared with 2019 and no reduction in life expectancy.","Researchers used mortality data from the National Family Health Survey 2019-21 to estimate that there were almost 12 lakh excess deaths in 2020.

NEW DELHI: Skewed distribution of rainfall in June-July saw nine states , including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49% whereas six states, including four in the south peninsula, reported excess to large excess of cumulative rainfall during June 1-July 20.State-wise, Jharkhand reported the highest deficit (49%) while Tamil Nadu recorded the highest surplus (83%) than their respective normal rainfall during the period.Overall, the country reported over 1% of deficit in cumulative rainfall with northwest (14% deficit) and east & northeast (12% deficit) India taking the biggest hit as on Saturday. Deficit was slightly reduced in the past 24 hours due to rains in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh caused by a depression over the Odisha coast.Region-wise, central India has no deficit, whereas the south peninsula reported 26% more than normal rainfall so far. Barring a few days of expected good rainfall this month, the overall situation may not improve much.There is a possibility of a weak phase of monsoon in early Aug due to delay in formation of La Nina - a climate condition associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. It is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. Rainfall situation in the deficit zones (northwest and east & northeast) will improve with the formation of La Nina in the later part of next month or in early Sept.The deficit, however, has so far not affected the kharif (summer sown) crop sowing operation as a large part of monsoon core zone (areas dependent on seasonal rains for farming operations) in the country received normal rainfall this month, improving even water storage in the major 150 reservoirs in many states. Data from Central Water Commission shows that the overall live storage improved from 20% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs on June 27 to 29% on July 18.The overall acreage of kharif crops, including paddy, pulses and oilseeds, showed a higher sown area this year so far compared to the corresponding period last year. A huge deficit (11%) of rainfall in June delayed the sowing operation but farmers could increase acreage during the month with the help of groundwater and other irrigation facilities, compared to the same period last year when India reported a slightly less (9%) deficit in 2023.Surprisingly, farmers so far this season don't appear enthused by the pitch around millets, nutri-cereals, which show decline in acreage at a time when over 60% of the kharif sowing operation is complete in the country. Their acreage as on Friday declined by 8% compared to the corresponding period last year, whereas the acreage of paddy rose by 7%.Higher total acreage can be attributed to focus on sowing of pulses and oilseeds, which reported over 15 lakh hectares (21% increase) and 12 lakh hectares (8% increase), respectively, more sown area as on Friday. A better prospect of procurement of paddy, pulses and oilseeds encouraged farmers to opt for these crops instead of millets whose procurement could not match the popular crops despite govt's focus on it during 'International Year of Millet' last year.Acreage data, released by the ministry on Friday, shows that the total area under coverage for all kharif crops has risen to 704 lakh hectares till July 19 against 680 lakh hectares in the same period last year.","Nine states, including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49%. Six states reported excess to large excess of cumulative rainfall during June 1-July 20.

Airport systems across India were restored at 3am Saturday after a 17-hour global outage caused by a software fault in computers running MS Windows. However, a large backlog of cancelled and delayed flights, along with undelivered baggage, means full normalisation may take a couple of days."" Flight operations are going smoothly now.

The on-time performance of domestic flights was affected Friday due to slower manual processes.IndiGo, Air India Express, Akasa, and SpiceJet, which use the affected operating system, experienced major delays. Vistara and Air India were also impacted due to some partners being on the downed server.IndiGo assured passengers that its team was working round the clock to ensure swift delivery of delayed baggage. ""We deeply regret the difficulties... In light of the recent global travel system outage, our team is continually putting in their best efforts and all our services are gradually being restored, including baggage handling,"" IndiGo said.The Microsoft outage had affected check-in systems used by Indian carriers, including IndiGo, Air India Group, Akasa and SpiceJet, from around 10.40am Friday. This led to manual processes such as hand-written boarding cards, no DigiYatra, security check stamping on boarding cards, non-functional displays at terminals, and long queues at airports.Air India Express announced past Saturday noon: ""The technical issues have been resolved, and we are now fully operational across all platforms. We can't wait to have you on board.""","Systems across India were restored at 3am Saturday after a 17-hour global outage caused by a software fault in computers running MS Windows. A large backlog of cancelled and delayed flights, along with undelivered baggage, means full normalisation may take a couple of days. IndiGo alone canceled 273 flights (about 14% of its daily operations)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895074,imgsize-18906,width-400,resizemode-4/111895074.jpg"
"Amid Puja Khedkar row, UPSC chief Manoj Soni quits 5 years before term ends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-puja-khedkar-row-upsc-chief-manoj-soni-quits-5-years-before-term-ends/articleshow/111894780.cms,"NEW DELHI: UPSC chairman Manoj Soni has tendered his resignation barely a year into his six-year tenure, citing ""personal reasons"". The news of his resignation, believed to have been submitted to the President some time back, comes amid the controversy over IAS probationer Puja Khedkar 's selection to the civil services based on forged identity, which had on Friday led UPSC to file a police complaint against her.Govt sources, however, told TOI that Soni's resignation was not linked in any way to the Khedkar episode. ""The resignation was submitted almost a month ago, well before the IAS probationer's selection became a matter of probe,"" an officer told TOI.There is no clarity on whether govt has taken any call yet on accepting Soni's resignation. A source indicated that govt may be mulling over a suitable replacement before relieving Soni.Soni, who had joined UPSC as a member in 2017 and took over as its chairman last year, is said to be keen to step down to devote more time to ""socio-religious"" activities. Reports indicated that he wants to give his undivided time to serving the Anoopam Mission, a non-profit organization linked to the Swaminarayan sect that he is deeply involved with. The resignation is also said to have mentioned health reasons, according to a source.Soni, an academician considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, became the vice-chancellor of his alma mater Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, in 2005. Only 40 years then, he was the youngest ever vice-chancellor in India. Later from 2009 to 2015, Soni was vice-chancellor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University, Gujarat for two terms.Controversies rocked his tenure at MSU with the biggest being the infamous ""obscenity row"" of 2007 when objections were raised against a student's artworks, alleging they hurt religious sentiments. Soni suspended a professor for not abiding by his directives to close the exhibition.Though a governor-appointed committee recommended Panikkar's suspension be withdrawn with a mild reprimand, its report was not accepted.Instead, based on a departmental inquiry headed by a retired district judge, Panikkar was permanently suspended and his retirement benefits withheld.Soni's tenure also witnessed controversies over appointments of six officers in a non-quorum meeting and admission of a student from a private college into the grant-in-aid Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE).UPSC had on Friday filed an FIR with the Delhi Police against Puja Khedkar for having fraudulently availed of attempts at the Civil Services Exam (CSE) beyond the permissible limit by faking her identity.","UPSC chairman Manoj Soni has tendered his resignation barely a year into his six-year tenure.

During the inaugural session of the 18th Lok Sabha, the opposition joined ranks to seek the Deputy Speaker's post, reminding govt that it was the trend till BJP came to power in 2014. While BJP gave the post to its ally AIADMK later in its first tenure, the post remained vacant for the entire second term of PM Narendra Modi.The opposition started the 18th Lok Sabha last month by seeking the deputy's post in lieu of which it was ready to support govt in the Speaker's election. After BJP refused to accede to its plea, the opposition fielded senior most MP in the House, Kodikunnil Suresh of Congress, against the BJP-NDA candidate Om Birla who was eventually elected as Speaker by a voice vote. There have since been speculations that BJP will again give the post to a coalition ally.But the opposition has not given up the demand and is ready to start the Budget session by flagging it again. Sources said the decision was taken at an informal consultation among the opposition allies. There is no clarity on the nature of consensus that would emerge in the INDIA bloc, but TMC has openly stated that the post should go to the Faizabad (Ayodhya) MP of Samajwadi Party Awadhesh Prasad, who has been in the limelight since winning the UP constituency of which the temple town is a part.Congress may not have an objection to it, but would prefer Suresh. Both Prasad and Suresh are dalit. But for any of it to fructify, BJP will first have to agree to give the ceremonial post to the opposition.",Opposition will start the pressure campaign by speaking about the demand at the all-party meeting called by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The 'factories' appear to have delivered yet again. NEET-UG 2024 results of candidates at centres like Tagore PG College, Sikar , Rajasthan; Modern School, Kota , Rajasthan; Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Kottayam , Kerala; Unit-1 School of Engineering, Rajkot, Gujarat; and Model School, Rohtak reinforce the influence of so-called 'coaching factories'.Amid allegations of systematic lapses by those seeking cancellation of NEET-UG 2024, the centre-wise results released by National Testing Agency Saturday show that centres located in coaching hubs have done exceedingly well, while those under the scanner for ""paper leak"" and other irregularities fared poorly. More than 2,000 candidates from centres in Sikar scored over 650 marks out of 720 while Kottayam, similar to Kota, also boasted a large number of high-scorers.Over 20% candidates from Tagore PG College centre scored 600 and more.In fact, there are more candidates who scored 650-plus (43) than 600-649 (30), and are almost assured of a coveted seat in a govt medical college.The analysis of the result data showed that while all eyes were on one of the centres in Haryana's Jh-ajjar, those who appeared for the exams at the centre in Rohtak in the same state, another hub of coaching, fared way better.For example, of the 734 candidates from Rohtak's Model School centre, one scored 700 and 14 others scored 650 and above. Additionally, there are 30 in the mark range of 600-649.IIT-Madras's report, which was submitted to Supreme Court regarding alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam, revealed that Kottayam ranked third in the country for the city-wise spread of top rank holders (top 1,000), following Sikar and Kota in Rajasthan.Sikar, which had 27 people in the top-1000 in 2023, saw an increase to 55 top rank holders this year.Similarly, Kota's top rank holders rose from 13 to 35. Kottayam, which previously had 14 rank holders in the top-1000, now boasts 25.The IIT-Madras's report further stated, ""This is attributed to these places having many coaching classes, which could be the reason for this increase.""Kottayam's Vidyananda Vidyabhavan, Junior Baselios English Medium School, and Chinmaya Vidyalaya have 8.2%, 11% and 10.4% of their candidates scoring 600 and above in the NEET-UG 2024 respectively. Between these centres, there are five aspirants with 700 and above marks and 29 are among the 30,000 across the country who scored 650 and above.Though the students taking coaching at these ""factories"" are drawn from across the country, many of them prefer to take the exam where attend coaching classes.Similar figures have come from a centre in another popular coaching destination: Rajkot in Gujarat.Of the 1,968 candidates who appeared for the examination at Unit-1 School of Engineering, over 250 scored 600 and above, and a whopping 12 scored 700 and more while one scored a perfect 720, probably the highest for any centre in the current NEET.Over 12.5% candidates here scored 600-plus marks.","NEET-UG 2024 results of candidates at centres like Tagore PG College, Sikar.
