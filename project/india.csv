India shifted from judicial interference to supporting arbitration: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-shifted-from-judicial-interference-to-supporting-arbitration-cji/articleshow/110810860.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Friday said India is walking shoulder to shoulder with leading centres for global commercial arbitration by replacing a regime of judicial interference with arbitration with one that supports arbitration, recognizes party autonomy and structures the role of courts in facilitating arbitration.Speaking at the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom with the honour of sitting on the chair of the president of UK SC, Justice Chandrachud said though India has created international arbitral centres of excellence, “we have to ensure that these new institutions are not controlled by a self-perpetuating clique.”“These institutions must be based on the foundation of robust professionalism and the ability to generate consistent arbitral processes. Transparency and accountability, values by which the work of conventional courts is assessed and critiqued, cannot be alien to the world of arbitration,” he said.Hoping that Indian arbitration institutions attain the trust and professionalism of their global counterpart, the CJI said as more and more commercial disputes move from courts to arbitral tribunals, “the substitution of courts should not result in creation of opaque structures.”Justice Chandrachud said commercial arbitration has remained relevant for the last five centuries, more so today as “the courts in India are overburdened despite the high courts disposing of 2.15 million cases and the district courts disposing 44.7 million cases in 2023.”Addressing the judges of the UK SC, the CJI said for Indian judiciary no case is big or small and every litigant has the right to just remedy. “The width of our jurisdiction was designed to ensure widest access to justice. But surely, every case need not find a remedy before the court, with emerging forms ofdispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation gaining acceptance,” he said.The CJI expressed concern that though arbitration as a mode of commercial dispute resolution is gaining ground in India, many petitions are being filed in the Supreme Court challenging high court orders on petitions challenging the awards of the arbitral tribunals.“The ostensible reason is the order (of the HC) but a scratch at the surface reveals that the real reason is a perceived lack of confidence in the arbitrator… Although arbitrators are private actors, they perform adjudicatory functions which require impartial decision-making… An independent arbitrator is impartial, and an impartial arbitrator is independent,” he said.","Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said India is walking shoulder to shoulder with leading centres for global commercial arbitration.

Take precautions in monsoon to prevent Ghatkopar type hoarding crash: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/take-precautions-in-monsoon-to-prevent-ghatkopar-type-hoarding-crash-sc/articleshow/110810852.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Railways to take adequate precautionary measures ahead of the monsoon to avoid incidents like the May 13 crash of an oversized hoarding at Ghatkopar that killed 14 persons and caused property damage.On an application filed by MCGM in a pending petition challenging the Bombay HC’s 2017 judgment ousting the civic body’s jurisdiction over hoardings on railway land, a vacation bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and P. B. Varale said the rains during the monsoon are accompanied by gusty winds and all authorities, including Railways and MCGM, should take extra care and measures to avoid such incidents. The bench posted the matter for hearing next week.MCGM said its policy permitted the erection of hoardings with a maximum size of 40 ft X 40 ft. The hoarding at Ghatkopar was 120 ft X 120 ft, which could not withstand the wind speed during a thunderstorm and collapsed on an adjacent petrol pump.Listing out 45 oversized billboards on land owned by southern and central railways, including three the size of the crashed Ghatkopar hoarding, the MCGM said, “Given the onset of monsoon and the grave hazard posed by such billboards to the general public, there exists an urgent and crucial need to regulate the sizes of hoardings immediately.”The 45 oversized hoardings, not conforming to the maximum permissible size of 40 ft X 40 ft stipulated by the civic body, “suffer from a high likelihood of collapse on the adjoining municipal roads/private lands/structures, etc. The said structures endanger the lives and properties of the public,” MCGM said in its application.The District Disaster Management Authority had, after the Ghatkopar crash, written to the railways for a structural audit of the oversized hoardings and their immediate removal. The railways responded by stating that MCGM has no jurisdiction over the hoardings on railway land.Appearing for the railways, additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee told the bench that the Ghatkopar hoarding crashed because the structure was unable to bear the load of the billboard. He said that billboards erected on railway properties are permitted only after considering the structural stability, the soil condition, and the probable wind speed during different seasons.MCGM said even the Ghatkopar hoarding had a structural stability certificate but collapsed because of its huge size. “Only obtaining a structural stability audit/certificate does not absolve the railways from their statutory duty to comply with the provisions of the Disaster Management Act,” it said and requested the bench for an urgent hearing on the application prior to the onset of the monsoon.","The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Railways to take adequate precautionary measures ahead of the monsoon.

Karnataka bans film over communal concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bans-film-over-communal-concerns/articleshow/110808076.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka govt has banned the screening of Bollywood film ‘ Hamare Baarah ’ in the state, citing that it may disturb communal harmony. The movie was scheduled for countrywide release on Friday.The order, issued under sections 15 (1) and 15 (5) of Karnataka Cinema (Regulation) Act 1964, banned the broadcast of even the trailer of the movie for two weeks or until further orders. The move came after several Muslim organisations across the state petitioned the govt, alleging the trailer of the film portrayed Islam in a “humiliating manner” and was “provocative”.“If the movie is screened, it will create rifts between religions and castes. Targeting one religion intentionally, harming communal harmony, creating rifts in the nation, and hurting sentiments of Muslims is part of a conspiracy,” said the order, adding: “Films should play an instrumental role in guiding society and not foment hatred between religions.”BJP’s senior functionary R Ashoka condemned the move, calling it “another attempt to suppress freedom of speech and expression in Karnataka”. Questioning the motives behind the ban, he asked who the CM and Karnataka Congress were trying to appease. “There is no threat to law and order in Karnataka because of this movie, which is being screened across the country. Instead of protecting the civil liberties and freedom of expression CM @siddaramaiah has yet again chosen to stand with radical elements.”","Karnataka govt has banned the screening of Bollywood film ‘ Hamare Baarah ’ in the state, citing that it may disturb communal harmony.

On Thursday, the high court recalled its earlier stay on the film's release after producers said it will cause them financial loss as tickets are sold.

The judges asked CBFC to set up a three-member committee, including a member of a minority community, to view the film and inform on Friday as the first show was scheduled for 10am.

Wife's affair is cruelty to husband: Chhattisgarh high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-affair-is-cruelty-to-husband-chhattisgarh-high-court/articleshow/110807752.cms,"RAIPUR: If a woman gets into an extramarital relationship , it amounts to mental cruelty on the husband, said Chhattisgarh high court as it overturned a lower court order and granted divorce to a man.""The appellant husband's testimony and evidence presented clearly indicate that the wife committed adulterous acts , amounting to cruelty. This justifies the granting of a decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,"" a division bench of Justice Goutam Bhaduri and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal said.The husband had moved high court after a Raigarh family court dismissed his application for divorce on grounds of cruelty.The husband said his wife's behaviour suddenly changed, triggering frequent quarrels over trivial issues. On May 27, 2014, she allegedly left her matrimonial home with their three children without informing the husband or his family. He tried to locate them, but failed, and filed a missing person's report the next day at a police station in Raigarh.He later discovered that his wife and children were staying at a friend's house in a village in the same district. He also alleged that on June 7, 2017, he saw her ""in an adulterous act"" at their home. He informed his family and police but no action was taken against the man, who allegedly threatened the husband with dire consequences.The wife denied these allegations, and alleged that her husband was abusive and prevented her from meeting their children. She claimed that the divorce application was based on false grounds.After examining the evidence and hearing both parties, the division bench noted that the couple had been living apart since 2017. The court highlighted the wife's admission during cross-examination that a male friend visited her home in her husband's absence, supporting the husband's claims of adultery and cruelty.Since the couple had been living separately for over six years, it indicated an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, the court noted. Citing a Supreme Court ruling, Chhattisgarh high court emphasised that prolonged separation can lead to mental cruelty, necessitating the severance of matrimonial ties, and granted divorce.","Chhattisgarh high court overturned a lower court order and granted divorce to a man.

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

RANCHI: In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu Party , retaining its single seat. This outcome mirrors the nationwide decline in the appeal of Modi's leadership. On the other hand, the India bloc demonstrated an improved performance, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the current election.The results in Jharkhand highlight the shifting political landscape, with the BJP's dominance facing challenges from opposition parties. The India bloc's gains suggest a growing support base and a potential shift in voter preferences. As the nation witnesses a change in the political dynamics, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future course of governance and policy-making in the state and beyond.The India bloc has secured all the tribal reserved seats in the recent elections. According to analysts, the Enforcement Directorate's actions against Hemant Soren, the working president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and former chief minister, were not well-received by the tribal voters.The JMM emerged victorious in Dumka, Singhbhum, and Rajmahal seats, successfully capitalizing on the tribal sentiment. This sentiment was fueled by the BJP-led central government's refusal to include a separate sarna code in the census register, which is a matter of identity for the tribal community.In an attempt to win the Dumka seat, the BJP had nominated Sita Soren, the elder daughter-in-law of Guruji. However, she was defeated by JMM's Nalin Soren, who secured a margin of 22,527 votes.","In Jharkhand, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured nine out of the 14 seats.

PATNA: In the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, the NDA alliance, led by CM Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and BJP, emerged victorious in 30 out of the 40 constituencies. Both JD(U) and BJP secured 12 seats each, while their allies, LJP (RV) and HAMS, won five and one seats, respectively. The opposition INDIA bloc managed to win nine seats, and an independent candidate secured one.Chirag Paswan , the president of LJP (Ram Vilas), has finally established himself as the true political successor of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, after a three-year struggle. By winning all the five LS seats his party was allotted in the NDA alliance, Chirag has not only maintained LJP's previous track record of keeping 100% strike rate but also established that he is the new Dalit icon on the political landscape of Bihar.Union ministers Giriraj Singh and Nityanand Rai successfully retained their Begusarai and Ujiyarpur seats. However, their colleague, power minister RK Singh, lost his traditional Ara seat to CPI-ML (Liberation)'s Sudama Prasad by a margin of around 60,000 votes.Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi , who leads the Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular, made his parliamentary debut at the age of 79 by winning the reserved seat of Gaya.

His impressive showing in the recent Lok Sabha elections has solidified his position as the face of the alliance in Bihar.As the BJP falls short of a majority in the Lok Sabha, the focus shifts to its alliance partners, JD(U) and TDP, who play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the NDA government.

MOHALI/BATHINDA: CISF constable Kulwinder Kaur was charged with ""voluntarily causing hurt"" and ""wrongful restraint"" in an FIR registered by Mohali police on Friday for her alleged act of confronting and slapping actor and newly elected BJP MP Kangana Ranaut at Chandigarh airport.Kulwinder, whom CISF suspended after Kangana's complaint, received support from individuals and organisations, some of whom offered her monetary and legal help if she was arrested or dismissed from service.Kulwinder Kaur, the CISF constable who allegedly confronted and slapped actor-MP Kangana Ranaut at Chandigarh airport on Thursday, has been booked under bailable sections 323 and 341 of IPC. Mohali police are scanning footage from CCTV cameras at the terminal to verify Ranaut's allegations. ""Action per the complaint filed by CISF has been taken. Further action is in process,"" Mohali SSP Sandeep Garg said.CISF DIG Vinay Kajla was quoted as saying that Kulwinder was ""apologetic"" about her ""emotional outburst"" - she allegedly confronted Kangana over her remarks about women's participation in the farm agitation - but there was no official word from the force on this.Sources said CISF will take action based on outcome of departmental inquiry against the constable. Kulwinder's husband, too, is a CISF employee attached to the dog squad and is posted at the same location.Among those who came out in support of the suspended constable was 82-year-old farm activist Mohinder Kaur, who had previously filed a defamation suit against Kangana for her remarks on the farm protest. ""Kangana has no sense of how to speak. Since she has been elected as an MP, she should be polite. She tried to brand Punjabis as extremists. She used derogatory words for us,"" the octogenarian said.Kangana, now MP from Mandi in Himachal, had posted on X a picture of Mohinder as ""dadi of Shaheen Bagh of Delhi"" and alleged that ""such women"" would turn up at a protest site for Rs 100.The actor had later deleted the post. Based on Mohinder's defamation suit, a Bathinda court had issued an arrest warrant against Kangana that a bench of Punjab and Haryana HC had stayed.Meanwhile, Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar has termed the airport episode ""most unfortunate"". He said any form of violence as a means of expressing dissent was unacceptable and must be condemned.","CISF constable Kulwinder Kaur was charged with ""voluntarily causing hurt"" and ""wrongful restraint"" in an FIR registered by Mohali police on Friday.

In July 2023, Chirag had touched the PM’s feet and Modi had hugged him ahead of the NDA meeting in Delhi. Chirag and his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who heads Rashtriya LJP, were present in the meeting. Modi’s response was seen as a signal of Chirag’s outfit returning to the NDA fold.Even during the recent election campaign in Hajipur, PM Modi had said he saw Chirag as a son who was the “future of Bihar”.On Friday, Chirag said the credit of NDA forming the govt again went to Modi. “It was his willpower which helped in registering such a massive victory. It is not a normal thing that NDA got such a big victory under the leadership of the PM for the third time in a row.” Stating that people had full faith in Modi, he said, “Because of you, today we can proudly say in front of the world that India has become the fifth-largest economy of the world.”Chirag said the PM had the willpower to reduce the difference between villages and cities, rich and poor, and to set the target of a developed India by 2047.HAM (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi, while announcing his support to Modi, said the commitment was from the family and lineage of Dasrath Manjhi who cut a road through a mountain with “chisel and hammer” in 24 years, signalling his party’s determination to remain in the NDA.

In 72 of the 75 constituencies that it contested both times, the number of votes it polled also fell by anything between a few thousand and 2.2 lakh. All told, it polled about 65 lakh fewer votes in UP this time despite the total number of votes polled in the state going up.The list of constituencies in which BJP got fewer votes this time includes Varanasi, where the PM won, Yogi's home turf Gorakhpur, Rajnath Singh's constituency Lucknow and Faizabad, which includes Ayodhya. Not surprisingly, Amethi and Rae Bareli too figure in the list.The only constituencies in which BJP polled more votes than last time in UP were Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) in the national capital region, Bareilly and Kaushambi. Even among these, its vote share was lower in 2024 than in 2019 in Bareilly and just slightly higher in the other two seats.BJP had polled just under 4.3 crore votes of the over 8.6 crore votes in UP last time. This time round, while the total votes polled in the state went up a little to just under 8.8 crore, BJP got a little over 3.6 crore votes.Part of this decline was because it did not contest three of the seats it had contested last time - Bijnor, Baghpat and Ghosi - but even if we look only at the 75 seats it contested in both elections, its votes polled dropped from 4.1 crore to 3.6 crore or about 50 lakh. That's an average of nearly 67,000 votes dropped on each seat.Of the 75 seats, BJP's votes declined by over a lakh in 12, including Mathura, Aligarh, Muzaffarnagar and Fatehpur Sekhri in the west and Gorakhpur in the east. In another 36 seats, the drop was between 50,000 and a lakh. These included Amethi, Rae Bareli, Allahabad, Ghaziabad, Mainpuri and Varanasi, where the PM got over 60,000 votes less this time.BSP had won 8 of these 75 seats last time. Of those, SP and Congress won six this time and Chandrashekhar won Nagina. The decline in its own votes meant that BJP could not capitalize on the BSP's decimation and could only wrest Amroha from it.","In 72 of the 75 constituencies that it contested both times, the number of votes it polled also fell by anything between a few thousand and 2.2 lakh.

Everyone is expecting a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in favour of Amaravati during N Chandrababu Naidu's swearing-in ceremony as CM to be held on June 12 near the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the capital region.Farmers are expecting a further increase of land prices in case of a positive statement by Modi.Land prices came down anywhere between 60% and 75% after outgoing chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced his plans of three capitals in 2019. All euphoria created around the proposed futuristic capital city vanished. After five years, with govt change, the realty sector in Amaravati is witnessing a 'V' shaped recovery in terms of prices.Ginjupalli Subbarao, a farmer from Amaravati, said that he is getting many calls from prospective buyers. ""There were no takers till six months ago but the sentiment has slowly started to change with people sensing change,"" he said. ""With the election results in favour of the alliance, land prices have come back to 2018 levels.""During the election campaign, Naidu had said that Amaravati would be revived soon after coming to power.Speaking to TOI, TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh gave more clarity saying his party did not have any plans to change the master plan for Amaravati prepared before they lost power in 2018. He said there was no better alternative to the existing masterplan, and they would stick to the original strategy of developing the city on a self-sustaining model.Despite spending about Rs 10,000 crore, the then TDP govt could not complete all trunk infrastructure works which included laying roads and drains along with giving power and water supply. Sources said Naidu is now planning to complete the trunk infrastructure works which will give enough thrust for private investors and developers to start their businesses.Several central government institutions like Reserve Bank of India, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), CPWD, Public Sector Undertakings like NTPC, ONGC, Indian Bank, State Bank of India and others have purchased lands to set up their regional offices in Amaravati. Sources said that Naidu is looking to bring all these institutions to Amaravati as soon as possible so that the economic activity will start rolling.Naturally, the demand for lands near these institutions is pushing the prices in these areas further up. Lands around private universities which have already opened campuses are also in high demand. While the farmers, who put up a valiant fight against YSRC govt, are happy with the renewed buyer interest, the investors are chasing the prices with FOMO (fear of missing out), said Gopal Yadav, a realtor from Amaravati.","Land prices came down anywhere between 60% and 75% after outgoing chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced his plans of three capitals in 2019.

The poster, with a photo of Nitish and bearing the phrase ""Tiger Zinda Hai"" - the title of a 2017 Salman Khan-starrer - has been put up at a vantage point near the planetarium, making heads turn.Its significance is not lost on the public. Critics had almost begun writing his political epitaph in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections owing to his frequent flip-flops.At one point of time, Nitish was seen holding BJP's party symbol - lotus - during Modi's roadshow in Patna on May 12 amid speculation that he could hand over the reins to his saffron partner.But silencing his critics, Nitish emerged as a ""kingmaker"" with JD(U) becoming the third-largest party in the NDA. The poster conveys this.""If anything, the poster seems to be saying that Nitish still decides political discourse in the country. This is a message to those who predicted political disaster for JD(U) in the polls,"" party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said. ""The fact is that whether you hate him or love him, you cannot ignore Nitish Kumar,"" he added.BJP reacted cautiously to the banner. ""Nitish-ji is very much active in politics. He is CM of Bihar and his party has 12 Lok Sabha members. He doesn't need a certificate from anyone,"" spokesperson Manoj Sharma said, adding some overenthusiastic supporters might have put up the banner.Such has been the impact of JD(U) in the polls that ally BJP has formally announced it will fight the next assembly polls in Bihar under Nitish's leadership. Prior to the poll outcome, his ""retirement plan"" was being talked about in political circles. JD(U) and BJP contested elections on 16 and 17 seats, respectively.","A huge poster of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has surfaced in the Bihar capital, grabbing everyone's attention.

Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh held parleys with leaders of NDA constituents.Significantly, Modi tried to douse spiralling speculation about allies seeking to extract plum portfolios and more berths and even the constitutional office of Speaker by asserting that he was not known for giving in to pressure. “I have been watching reports for the past two days and most of them are baseless, far from the truth. They have not got an opportunity in the past 10 years and they might be on an overdrive. A few among us might fall in the trap of such people saying that I have good contact and can get the berth for you. We need to beware of such people... those who know Modi will tell you that such efforts are futile,” Modi said while addressing the NDA parliamentary party soon after being elected its leader.This left many wondering whether the comment, though cloaked in concern for newly-elected MPs, especially first-termers and those belonging to partners, was also meant for those who may have concluded that BJP falling short of majority would render him vulnerable to coalition pressures. It, interestingly, might help the leadership of NDA partners in dealing with surging expectations of their flock that their numbers could be leveraged for outsized returns.Reiterating that his govt won’t be driven by headlines, Modi said there might be people claiming to be distributing portfolios and playing a role in govt formation but such attempts were futile. “If you receive any call, verify 10 times, as there are a few habitually doing so. In this high tech age, letters with my forged signatures could also be circulated and our political rivals are experts in this job. I urge all of you not to fall victim to such conspiracies and be careful about rumours. You need to have faith in the team sitting inside this House,” he said.Nadda had led the NDA delegation which included party leaders Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Ashwini Vaishnaw and C N Manjunath. The delegation also had leaders of other parties in the NDA, including N Chandrababu Naidu, Nitish Kumar, Eknath Shinde, H D Kumaraswamy, Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, Pawan Kalyan, Ajit Pawar, Anupriya Patel, Jayant Chaudhary, Joyanta Basumatary, Atul Bora, Indra Hang Subba, Sudesh Mahto, Chandra Prakash Choudhary and Ramdas Athawale.Later, addressing reporters in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, Modi said the President had appointed him prime minister-designate. He said he had informed Murmu that the swearing-in could be held Sunday evening.Modi said Rashtrapati Bhavan would work out the details of the oath-taking ceremony on Sunday, when he would hand over the list of the council of ministers to the President. “The NDA govt has been given a chance to serve the country for the third time. I am grateful to my countrymen, and I assure you that India will continue to develop in every sector at an even faster pace than during our previous two terms,” Modi said.",The President handed over the letter of appointment after BJP chief J P Nadda presented letters of support from NDA parties.

"Committed to principle of ‘sarv panth sambhav (all religions equal)’, says Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/committed-to-principle-of-sarv-panth-sambhav-all-religions-equal-says-modi/articleshow/110807006.cms,"NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi on Friday emphasised the role of consensus in governance as he said the next “10 years of NDA” will be dedicated to good governance , committed to the principal of “sarv panth sambhav” (all religions are equal) to fulfil growing regional and national aspirations as he acknowledged that an era of competitive cooperative federalism had begun.Speaking after his election as leader of the NDA parliamentary party, Modi emphasised that while NDA, a pre-poll alliance, had got the majority, a consensual approach was needed to serve the nation. “Sarkar chalane ke liye bahumat chahiye lekin desh chalane ke liye sarvmat bahut zaroori hai,” he said and asserted, “I assure people of the country and you all that no stone will be left unturned to serve the nation with consensus.”Modi also declared his commitment to “sarv panth sambhav” — the unique Indian concept which enjoins upon the state not to differentiate among citizens on the ground of faith but, unlike in the Western concept of secularism, does not seek to evict religion from the public arena. Political circles felt the remarks stood in contrast to Modi's strong attack on “Muslim quota” which the opposition and others had dubbed divisive and polarising. His putting forward the consensual feat was also seen as a switch prompted by BJP's drop in numbers and the corresponding accretion in the opposition's strength.However, the speech was also an exercise in projecting dominance, with Modi making light of Congress's improved strength by pointing out that even after a decade, Congress could not win a three-digit tally. He echoed the sentiment of allies like CMs of Bihar and Maharashtra, Nitish Kumar and Eknath Shinde, who contended that the opposition had managed to sway sections with their “false narratives”, and that the increased strength of Congress was an aberration, rather than the beginning of a pattern. “So far, they were sinking slowly but now they will hurtle down the abyss,” Modi said even as he projected another 10 years of NDA at the Centre.He also mocked celebrations post-verdict in the opposition camp. “For two days after the election results came, some people created such an atmosphere that we had lost. But the country knows that we were not defeated. Our values are such that victory does not create hysteria among us and we do not ridicule the defeated,” he said. He added that even a child would tell that it was the NDA that was in office before the polls and which is in office after the polls. ""Where did we lose? NDA was there yesterday, is there today and will be there tomorrow.”Modi, however, also emphasised that for all the jubilation in the Congress camp, the party 's cumulative score in the last three elections was lower than what BJP achieved in this election.Modi, who mentioned NDA nearly 20 times, said the combine stood for ""New India, Developed India and Aspirational India"" and, unlike the “INDI Alliance”, was not an alliance of convnience. ""It is an organic alliance,"" he said, promising that the allies could always count on him for any help. ""Jahan kaam wahan hum,” he assured.Referring to AAP's pullout of of “INDI bloc”, Modi said his prediction that the opposition alliance would start unravelling after declaration of results had come true. He emphasised that NDA was the longest-surviving alliance and was committed to the policy of “nation first” as he also attacked the INDIA bloc as a contrast which had grouped together for its hunger for office and obsession to defeat just one person. “If you see in the context of alliances and statistics, then this is the strongest alliance govt,"" he said.Modi highlighted the growing footprint of NDA, saying the alliance was in office in 22 states, which reflected the spirit of India in its true essence. “There are 10 tribal-dominated states of which NDA is serving in seven states. We are committed to the Constitution's spirit of ‘ sarv panth sambhav ’, look at Goa and north-eastern states, where Christian community is predominant but we have got the opportunity to serve,” Modi said.","Narendra Modi says next '10 years of NDA' will be dedicated to good governance.

Questioning the move, party spokesperson Pawan Khera said the statues were shifted out of "" vengeance and vendetta "".

Ajit Pawar & his MLAs to raise farmers' issues with PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajit-pawar-his-mlas-to-raise-farmers-issues-with-pm-modi/articleshow/110806392.cms,"NASHIK: A section of the NCP MLAs who attended the Thursday's meeting with the party chief, Ajit Pawar , expressed 'anguish' over the Union govt's failure to roll back the ban on onion exports before the Lok Sabha election, which sent a wrong message among the farming community in the state.Ajit Pawar had called the meeting of the party MLAs to take stock of his party's poor performance in the recently concluded general election, wherein the NCP managed to win only one of the four seats it contested.Some of the MLAs present in the meeting told TOI that they felt that Centre's failure to lift the ban on onion exports before the election ""sent a wrong message to the onion growers"", who constitute a sizeable chunk of voters in constituencies like Dindori, Dhule, Sinnar and Ahmednagar.""We told Ajit Dada that many of the NCP MLAs hail from the rural areas where votes from the farming community are extremely important. During our campaign for the Mahayuti candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, we were asked by the farmers on the onion export ban issue. We failed to provide them with proper answers,"" NCP's Sinnar MLA Manikrao Kokate said.Union minister Bharati Pawar lost the Dindori seat to NCP (SCP) nominee Bhaskar Bhagare because of the growing anger among the onion farmers. The Dindori constituency is considered to be the onion bowl of India.What has sent alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power in the state is the voting trend in the Nashik and Dindori Lok Sabha constituencies. In these two constituencies, Mahayuti candidates were behind the MVA nominees in their respective assembly segments. Apart from the onion ban issue, the party MLAs pointed at the growing distress among the cotton and soyabean farmers in the state, who were receiving low price for their yield, affecting them financially.""It was decided in the Thursday meeting that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes oath for his third term, an NCP delegation led by Ajit Dada would meet him and other Union ministers requesting greater focus on farmers' issues . The focus will be on measures to overcome the problems in Maharashtra,"" Kokate said. According to the NCP MLAs, the Union govt must play a proactive role in reducing the distress among the farmers in Maharashtra ahead of the assembly polls. ""The NCP will put pressure on Centre to roll back the ban on onion exports and solve the other issues plaguing the farmers in Maharashtra,"" Kokate added.","Ajit Pawar had called the meeting of the party MLAs to take stock of his party's poor performance in the recently concluded general election.
