PM should clear stand on 50% quota cap on reservations: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-stand-on-50-quota-cap-congress-to-pm-modi/articleshow/109769291.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clear his stand on whether he will support an amendment to the Constitution to remove the 50% cap on reservation for SC/ST and OBCs to give them their rightful due.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused the PM of distorting the Congress party manifesto by trying to give a “communal colour to it”.He said the party was categorically clear and said so in its manifesto too that it will do away with the 50% cap on reservations for SC/ST and OBCs. He denied the PM’s allegation about religion-based reservation saying it was a fake charge.Rubbishing the BJP brass’ denials, Congress said changing the Constitution has been the usual practice of BJP and highlighted that after the draft Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that it rejected the Constitution.Ramesh quoted an article from November 30, 1949 issue of RSS mouthpiece ‘Organiser’ to prove his point. Reading from the article, he said that “the RSS ideologues opposed the Constitution because it was neither inspired nor based on Manusmriti.”Ramesh alleged that when BJP is talking about “400 paar”, they are basically seeking the right to change the Constitution as the BJP and RSS are against “secularism and social justice"".He demanded that the PM clarify his stand instead of “constant diversion, distortion and defamation” of the opposition party. ""I want to ask the prime minister, who wants to give a communal colour to our Nyay Patra and wants to mislead, that will he remove the cap of 50% reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs?,"" Ramesh said.“We have always said that social and economic backwardness is the only basis for giving reservations. Because the Supreme Court has fixed the cap at 50% and some states have crossed this limit so we want to bring an amendment to the Constitution so that in states where the limit has been crossed they can get the legal status,” he explained.",Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused the PM of distorting the Congress party manifesto.

Samajwadi Chhatra Sangh leaders

LUCKNOW: Leaders are born on campuses, they say. Taking a cue, hundreds of students, affiliated with different student wings, are busy contributing their bit in the Lok Sabha elections, despite the statewide ban on student union elections in universities and colleges.While some of these student leaders are excellent poets and slogan writers, others are shouldering the responsibility of war room, mobilizing youth vote or acting as foot soldiers of their respective political outfits.There are many who are handling social media platforms of politicians or have been entrusted with the task of conducting door-to-door campaigns.TOI talked to a few of these student leaders.Clad in dhoti and kurta, Vindhyavasni Shukla, 21, attends classes in Lucknow University's defence studies department and then rushes back to the party office to make a framework for how all ABVP student leaders will divide themselves and move in different directions of the state to strengthen party's vote bank, with special focus on youth.“I will be doing door-to-door campaigning in Mohanlalganj, Salempur, Unnao and Shravasti Lok Sabha seats. I wear dhoti and kurta to university to make students understand our party's message that advocates staying connected to roots and popularising Indian tradition and beliefs across the country,” said Vindhyavasni, who almost held a month-long protest for student union election revival.He said that recently PM Narendra Modi had also urged content creators to share stories on India's culture, heritage, and traditions with the world and I feel by adopting Indian traditional attire I am also doing my bit.“I have been working in the interest of students, be it of Lucknow University or any other college or university. Have been on a hunger strike and continuously protested for student issues like fees, scholarship problems and others which no other student outfit affiliated with other political parties did. Hence through my work, I am adding youth votes for my party,” he added.Like Shukla, other active student leaders have also been assigned their role.“I am shouldering the responsibility of communicating all govt schemes, working on statistics on how BJP government schemes benefited society at large,"" said BA student Abhijeet Kumar.ABVP student leaders Shashi Prakash Mishra and Utkarsh Tiwari who have good oration and writing skills are busy working on taglines, social media messages and poems for the party.“All NSUI student representatives in universities and colleges of different districts are setting up booth brigades, the members of which will not just be deputed at voting booths but will also campaign to bring youth to the booth to exercise their franchise,” said LU NSUI president Prince Prakash.“In war rooms, we have already assigned tasks to student leaders, while some are sending Rahul Gandhi's message, others are highlighting BJP's anti-democratic work or popularising the party through Facebook and Instagram reels, and YouTube videos,” he said.“Not just boys but girl NSUI representatives are also busy making slogans and caricatures advocating how Congress will be a people's party which guarantees employment for youth, zero religion and caste politics, development goals for the country and others,” he added.Another NSUI student leader and MA (sociology) student Vishal Singh said, “I along with other student leaders will campaign for our leader in Lok Sabha constituencies like Barabanki, Moradabad and Varanasi and will work towards connecting people with the party by highlighting the work done in Congress regime in the past.”“We have made slogans and posters of our leader Rahul Gandhi highlighting his efforts to empower the youth, farmers, women and laborers through Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,” he said.“Be it Ekana cricket stadium, Lucknow Metro or Lucknow riverfront, all became a possibility during Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh. We will run a picture campaign of these places on our social media platforms highlighting that opposition party rule failed to do such development which is visible and needs no evidence,"" said SCS student leader Mahendra Yadav.He said that apart from these student leaders have already left for campaigning in different directions, and our war rooms, booth in-charges and door-to-door student campaigners list are ready.","Hundreds of students, affiliated with different student wings, are busy contributing their bit in the Lok Sabha elections.

LUCKNOW: Living on the fringes, facing discrimination and exclusion in a variety of ways, persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too. From guaranteed income, increased job opportunities to improved accessibility to buildings and transportation, PwDs have put forward their demands from political parties in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections to improve their quality of life.They said they are pleased that three major political parties have promised to look into their issues, but they want more parties to focus on their demands and take tangible action beyond mere words.Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of enforcing existing laws like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD) 2016.Speaking to TOI, Arman Ali, executive director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), stressed the importance of taking action to address the needs of people with disabilities.He highlighted the necessity for health insurance coverage aligned with Ayushman Bharat and increased representation in Parliament and governance.“Although some of these demands were included in the manifestos of major parties in the 2019 LS polls, they were not fulfilled,” he said.Ali emphasised the growing political awareness and participation among disabled individuals.Amit Rawat, a visually impaired PhD student from Lucknow University, pointed out that while one major party's manifesto included promises related to housing and transportation improvements, other parties focused on care centres, increased pensions, and Braille inclusion.“There is need for tangible action beyond words. Parties must prioritise employment for disabled individuals and address implementation issues such as train seat reservations etc,” he said.Another disabled student, Ram Vijay from Shakuntala Mishra Deemed University, expressed disappointment with the parties in failure to fulfill the previous promises.He cited the example of an app called Suramya Bharat, intended to assist disabled individuals in suggesting improvements to public spaces, which has not been effectively implemented.“We face challenges when we visit govt offices, access roads and even schools, colleges. There is a need for concerted efforts from all political parties to address these issues,” he said.Shiv Prasad, an activist from Maharajganj, highlighted disparities in pension amounts across states and stressed the need for uniformity and increased support.He also pointed out the lack of clarity in provisions of the RPwD Act, emphasizing the need for representation of disabled people in politics and policymaking.Krishna Kumar, an MEd student from Shakuntala University, stressed the importance of increasing reservation for disabled individuals in education and employment.He explained that the types of disabilities covered under the act have increased significantly, necessitating a proportional increase in reservation quotas to ensure inclusivity.*Committed to continuing the provision of affordable housing prioritising persons with disabilities under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana*Accessible solutions tailored to the needs of disabled individuals*Raise pensions for disabilities under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs 200-500 per month to Rs 1,000 pm.Expand constitutional provisions of Article 15 and 16 to prohibit discrimination based on disability and impairment, or sexual orientation.*Care centres and inclusion of Braille.*Recognise Braille script as sign language and enforce the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.*Proposed measures such as disability budgeting, earmarking 5% allocations across ministries for the disabled, and removal of GST on aids and appliances."," persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too.

5 reasons to be bullish on wheat this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-reasons-to-be-bullish-on-wheat-this-year/articleshow/109767756.cms,"New Seed Varieties

Private Purchase Zooms

Diversifying Markets

Moving Away From Paddy

Most of the wheat has arrived in the mandis of Punjab and Haryana, the two states with the highest procurement . And by all accounts it’s a good crop , providing much needed comfort to govt and private players .The crop, which comes on the back of a good yield this year – as high as 25-26 quintals an acre in parts of Punjab (against 22 quintals or so last year) – is much watched given that silos emptied out after two years of poor harvest.Govt is grappling with the lowest level of wheat stocks in 16 years – a little over 75 lakh tonnes at the start of April against the buffer requirement of 74.6 lakh tonnes for this time of year – and globally, too, prices are under pressure.So far, govt procurement is estimated at 200 lakh tonnes, compared with 190 lakh tonnes at the same time last year. In Punjab, the prolonged winter has resulted in around 91 lakh tonnes reaching mandis so far, compared with 103 lakh tonnes at this time last year.“We are seeing the best crop in at least five-six years,” says Manjinder Singh Mann, secretary of Khanna Agricultural Produce Market Committee.In Karnal, Gyanendra Singh, director of ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, lists out multiple reasons for this year’s bumper crop, which he argues may beat govt estimates. “The area under cultivation has increased, we had a good winter, which was prolonged and there has been accelerated deployment of climate resistant varieties. Nearly 60% of the varieties were released during the last five years.” New varieties are less prone to damage by pests, something that farmers in the two states are reporting.At the FCI headquarters in Delhi, officials reckon that govt procurement could reach 310 lakh tonnes, against 262 lakh tonnes last year, based on higher purchases in most parts – from Punjab and Haryana to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. While Punjab is going to remain on top with purchases of over 130 lakh tonnes (121 lakh tonnes last year), Haryana is estimated to generate 70 lakh tonnes this year (against last year’s 63 lakh tonnes). FCI officials are banking on a 10-fold jump from UP to around 20 lakh tonnes as govt purchases currently are estimated at 3.4 lakh tonnes, compared with last year’s 5.6 lakh tonnes. They are also estimating a threeto four-fold increase in Rajasthan, from around 4 lakh tonnes to nearly 12-14 lakh tonnes. MP remains a source of bother, although the target is to buy around 80 lakh tonnes, compared with 71 lakh tonnes last year.But it isn’t just govt agencies that are buying whatever is reaching the mandis, private players are ramping up their stocks too.In Khanna, once the largest grain market, around 40% of the purchases may end up in private hands. In neighbouring Rajpura, which also sees robust trading, more than half the stock brought to the mandi has been purchased by flour mills, some of whom sell to big players, such as ITC, Adani and Nestle.Davinder Singh, president of the arhtia association in the APMC, estimates that of the 25 lakh bags of 50kg each, private players will this year buy around 10 lakh. Last year, they had bought 4.5 lakh of the 22 lakh bags in the mandi, and in 2022, two lakh of the 14 lakh bags.In Gharaunda and Karnal, two mandis in Haryana that TOI recently visited, private demand is strong.While private players have been present in the grain market, and their share of total purchases is rising, this year is different. “The govt does not have too much stock, so we don’t know if it will undertake open market sale this year, something it did actively last year,” said Atul Goyal, of Amar Roller Flour Mills, a large buyer from Rajpura.There is also expectation of prices rising in the coming months. Against a price of Rs 2,280 a quintal for private players at the moment, prices for June are around Rs 2,450 and may rise to Rs 3,000 by Oct, says Singh. Against procurement of just under one lakh tonnes of wheat in Khanna, in 2023, Rajpura reported purchases of over 105 lakh tonnes. One of the reasons for higher private purchases in Punjab may also have to do with state govts in MP and Rajasthan deciding to pay a bonus of Rs 125 a quintal above the Centre’s minimum support price of Rs 2,275 a quintal, resulting in some trade moving out.In any case, arhtias – the middlemen who run the show in mandis in Punjab and Haryana and were seen to be the key driver of the farmers’ protest when govt had decided to amend the farm laws – prefer private sales as they earn Rs 57 a quintal, compared with Rs 46 from govt. Besides, the payment comes on the same day, while they have to wait for the end of the season with govt procurement.For farmers in this part of the country, arhtias are the crucial link, often providing loans during marriages or emergencies. Of course, direct payment into bank accounts has meant that cash flows to the farmers within three days in Haryana and in around a week in Punjab.“The system favours us now. Now, arhtias have to ask us for money, instead of them deducting the money and paying us,” says Sukhbir Kumar, a farmer selling his produce in Gharaunda.For years, farmers from adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh, or even distant Bihar, would see their produce sold in mandis in Haryana and Punjab. But with UP govt deciding to aggressively push procurement, Karnal is seeing fewer farmers drive past the state border.Ram Pal Singh from Shamli is one of the exceptions. He has driven past police barricades at the border to sell his 80 quintals of wheat to arhtias, settling for cash payment. “I have been coming here for more than 30 years. The mandi on our side does not have facilities like here,” he says, smoking a bidi at a tea stall as he waits for the grains to be cleaned.Ramesh Yadav from Madhepura is part of the thousands of workers who travel to Khanna every year. He has already harvested 20 quintals of wheat in his village, selling a part of it at lower than MSP. “The maize (which has also been sold below MSP) will travel to Punjab and fetch 10-15% more,” says Yadav as he breaks for lunch after spreading the wheat to dry in Khanna.“No one in this part of the country eats parmal rice that is procured. It is either distributed in the poorer states or supplied for mid-day meals or in jails,” says the secretary of one of the APMCs in Haryana.But farmers still prefer to grow paddy as the state machinery purchases it at the MSP, shielding them from price fluctuations. While Haryana govt procures some amount of mustard and sunflower seeds, it isn’t enough.“Last year, I sold maize below MSP. In my fields, I may not be able to grow urad or mung,” says Kawaljit Singh in Karnal.Standing a few metres away, Roshan Lal, who tills around 30 acres to grow wheat, paddy and potatoes, acknowledges the problem with paddy. “ I grow paddy because I get MSP. With maize the yield is good, it requires lower amount of water, fertiliser and pesticides, but I may not be able to sell it,” says Lal, who complains of low income for farmers and intends to migrate to the US in a few years to join his son in California.In Punjab the problem is even more acute as there is no govt procurement, farmers said.“The water table has gone down, now we find water at 150 feet, compared with 100 feet five years ago. I know there is a problem and it will only increase. I can try other crops such as dal, maize or mustard, provided there is assured procurement,” says Harinder Singh from Channi Majra village near Khanna.When farmers in Punjab hit the streets earlier this year, Centre had suggested it could guarantee procurement of maize, pulses and cotton for five years to farmers who diversified from paddy, a key source of pollution in north India post-Diwali due to stubble burning. The demand was, however, rejected by farmer unions.","Most of the wheat has arrived in the mandis of Punjab and Haryana, the two states with the highest procurement. The prolonged winter has resulted in around 91 lakh tonnes reaching mandis so far, compared with 103 lakh tonnes at this time last year. “We are seeing the best crop in at least five-six years,” says Manjinder Singh Mann, secretary of Khanna Agricultural Produce Market Committee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109767792,imgsize-2239818,width-400,resizemode-4/109767792.jpg"
10 years in jail for nothing Who should pay for it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-years-in-jail-for-nothing-who-should-pay-for-it/articleshow/109766946.cms,"How bad is the situation?

Worse under special laws

Trial court has key role

How much compensation?

What connects three professors — from Delhi, Kolhapur and Nagpur — to 17 residents of a village in Madhya Pradesh? All of them spent time in jail as undertrials or convicts before they were either acquitted or granted bail due to lack of evidence, with the courts questioning the cases against them.Take the case of former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba.Acquitted by the Bombay high court in March, Saibaba was convicted for Maoist activities under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and spent nearly 10 years behind bars as an undertrial and convict.In its judgment, the high court observed that the prosecution failed to link Saibaba to any crime. “In fact, there is no evidence brought forth by the prosecution to connect the persons (Saibaba and other accused) with any actual act of terrorism which had taken place in the past or to demonstrate how the persons were directly connected with and responsible for the commission of any other act of terrorism,” the court observed.After his release, Saibaba — who is disabled — said he had developed severe medical conditions in prison, including a heart ailment. The former professor was also denied permission to attend his mother’s funeral. “The prison department and government robbed me of fulfilling my mother’s wishes in her final days,” he said.There are many other cases, not always in serious offences, where people spend years behind bars waiting to be exonerated. The term used to describe cases where a person is arrested, jailed and denied bail for extended periods of time falls under what can be categorised as “miscarriage of justice”.Experts as well as a Law Commission report point to this problem being very prevalent in the Indian criminal justice system. The price for this is almost entirely borne by the person accused, like losing prime years of one’s life and emerging with health problems acquired during incarceration.In countries like the US, and the UK, those who face wrongful prosecution are eligible to file claims for compensation , which are then evaluated. In India, courts have pointed to lack of evidence and even malicious or politically-motivated prosecutions. But those who suffer the legal process don’t even get an apology, forget compensation.According to National Crime Records Bureau data from all states for 2022, close to 75% of those in India’s 1,330 jails are undertrials.Of the 4.34 lakh undertrials in Indian prisons, almost half are aged between 18 and 30 years, their most productive years economically. A total of 3.26 lakh inmates are facing cases filed under Indian Penal Code offences. The 2022 data indicates that the overall conviction rate for offences under the IPC is about 35%.Take the case of the 17 people arrested from Mohad in Madhya Pradesh’s Burhanpur district in 2017. Their alleged crime was celebrating Pakistan’s victory in the ICC Champions Trophy final against India. Two of those aprehended were minors.They were initially accused of criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity. During some court hearings, slogans like “Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko” (shoot the traitors) and “atankwadiyon ko phansi do” (hang the terrorists) were shouted at them. They were in jail for more than six years as undertrials. All of them were acquitted by a district court.“After going through all the evidence, arguments and eyewitnesses, there was no proof that the accused raised slogans and burnt firecrackers,” the trial court’s judgment said.In the case of Kashmiri professor Javed Ahmed Hajam, who was teaching at a college in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district, his ‘crime’ was posting two WhatsApp statuses in August 2022 that got him charged with promoting enmity.On August 5, his WhatsApp status said ‘Black Day Jammu & Kashmir’ to mark the abrogation of the state’s special status. On August 14, his WhatsApp status read: ‘Happy Independence Day Pakistan’.Hajam spent about a month behind bars and then fought a legal battle for nearly two years before the case was quashed by the Supreme Court. The court said everyone had a “right to be critical of the action of abrogation of Article 370 and the change of status of Jammu and Kashmir”.“If every criticism or protest of the actions of the State is to be held as an offence under Section 153A, democracy, which is an essential feature of the Constitution of India, will not survive,” the court observed.The court also made an observation about the need to educate the police machinery on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.Under the stringent UAPA — where getting bail is even harder than other criminal cases — more than 24,000 people were accused in 5,027 cases registered between 2016 and 2020. Data revealed in response to a question in Rajya Sabha showed that just 212 people had been convicted in these cases, and 386 were acquitted.Justice Abhay Thipsay (retd) — who was in the Allahabad and Bombay high courts — said in many cases undertrials are not being granted bail and judges are shirking bail applications.“There is no doubt that there should be a process and it can emanate from the trial court’s judgment,” said Amit Desai, a senior Bombay high court advocate.According to Desai, the trial court is the best place to decide who can be held liable or responsible in a case where a person has been wrongly persecuted by an investigating agency or the prosecution.However, he said, some changes can be made to laws. An accused person, according to Desai, should have their rights enhanced just like the victims’ in the Criminal Procedure Code. “Balancing the rights of the victim and the accused is absolutely necessary,” he said.Sanjay Hegde, a senior advocate who mostly prac tises in the Supreme Court, also felt there should be a law to allow courts to rule on cases where the rights of the accused are completely ignored or violated during their prosecution.“There should be legislation which defines these things so that the trial courts feel empowered to make such observations or pass relevant orders,” said Hegde.The senior lawyer said cases where a person is acquitted for reasons other than wrongful prosecution shouldn’t be considered.Various suggestions about a special law to compensate victims did feature in a report submitted by the Law Commission in Aug 2018. But they have remained suggestions. The commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice BS Chauhan, recommended a law to compensate victims of miscarriage of justice and special courts in every district that would decide cases quickly.Anyone acquitted by a court in a case should be able to file a claim, the report said. These special courts could have the power to direct the authorities to initiate proceedings against erring officials.The commission suggested an interim compensation between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 in cases where a person spent more than six months in jail. It said the final compensation should be decided on the basis of all the losses caused to the petitioner — including loss of property, health, opportunities and family life.The report said the court should also provide petitioners with “non-pecuniary assistance” for the rehabilitation of victims.Justice Thipsay said the biggest challenge to addressing wrongful prosecutions is that society doesn’t feel very strongly about the issue. “People simply feel that if someone was wrongly prosecuted, he or she was eventually acquitted or discharged. So, that is enough,” he said. “There is no outrage, therefore the system feels that there is no need to do anything more,” he said.","Three professors and 17 residents of a village in Madhya Pradesh spent time in jail as undertrials or convicts.

Sisodia delaying trial in excise case: Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sisodia-delaying-trial-in-excise-case-court/articleshow/109764644.cms,"NEW DELHI: While dismissing former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia ’s second bail plea , a court rejected his contention that the proceedings in the money laundering case linked to the alleged liquor policy scam have been delayed or that the case is proceeding at a snail’s pace. The so-called delay, the court of special judge Kaveri Baweja opined, could clearly be attributable to Sisodia himself.“It is apparent that the applicant, individually and along with different accused, has been filing one or other application/making oral submissions frequently, some of them frivolous, that too on a piecemeal basis, apparently as a concerted effort for accomplishing the shared purpose of causing delay in the matter,” the judge said in the 42-page order issued on Tuesday while pronouncing that “the argument of the applicant that he has not contributed to the delay in proceedings or that the case has been proceeding at a snail’s pace, therefore, cannot be accepted”.Sisodia stated that the prosecution had assured the Supreme Court last year that the trial would conclude in six-eight months, and he was entitled to seek bail as per the apex court’s Oct 30, 2023 order if the trial was protracted and proceeded at a snail’s pace in the next three months.The court, however, said the steady progression of the case, despite the apparent attempts to slow down its progress, couldn’t by any standard be equated with a snail’s pace. “The so-called delay caused in the progression of the case is also clearly on account of reasons attributable to the applicant,” stated the order, which was made available on Wednesday.The court also rejected Sisodia’s argument seeking parity with co-accused Benoy Babu, who was released after 13 months in jail, saying there was a difference in the nature of allegations against them.Rejecting Sisodia’s contention that he should be released on bail because of the health condition of his wife, the court said his plea did not cite any medical emergency or urgent medical condition warranting his release. “The applicant in his application has mentioned that there is nobody in the family except him to support her (wife). However, this is factually incorrect as the applicant has a son who can take care of the applicant’s wife,” the judge said.“Even otherwise, from the medical record of the wife of the applicant as annexed with the application under consideration, it appears that she has been suffering from the said ailment for a long time and has also been receiving requisite medical treatment and care for the same. The application discloses no imminent or urgent need or any medical emergency warranting the release of the accused/applicant on bail for this reason,"" the court noted.Meanwhile, the court also listed 135 applications filed by different accused since April 2023 for various reasons, including requests to seek documents relied on by the prosecution, CCTV recordings of their custodial interrogation, and a request for interim bail.","Court rejects Manish Sisodia's contention that the proceedings in the money laundering case have been delayed or that the case is proceeding at a snail’s pace.

Voting for TMC means voting for BJP, so it's better to vote for BJP only.

To illustrate, large privately owned ponds extending up to 500 acres can be acquired and put in control of a govt agency or a cooperative society so that the pond is preserved so as to subserve the common good,” Dwivedi argued.“Once the property is acquired, it indisputably becomes a material resource of the community. Upon acquisition, the private property vests in the state. All state property would be a material resource of the community, and upon acquisition, it must be distributed so as to subserve the common good,” he added.The state’s second counsel, Gopal Shankaranarayanan, argued in the same vein but suddenly changed tack to ruffle feathers by questioning the validity of SC’s five-judge bench judgment, which by three to two majority had last year declined to grant legal status to same-sex marriages.He said the constitutional court, having been convinced about discrimination faced by LGBTQIA+ community, should have moulded relief under Article 14 (right to equality). He said the majority judgment was ‘per incuriam’ as it did not heed the settled principle that in the face of discrimination, relief should be provided. He went on to argue that the same-sex marriage issue needed to be referred to a larger bench of seven judges.This drew objection from solicitor general Tushar Mehta who said this issue was unrelated to the interpretation of Article 39(b) engaging the attention of the nine-judge bench.","West Bengal walked the path taken by Union and Maharashtra govts to argue before a nine-judge Supreme Court bench.

Such updation in many cases is not complete even till midnight as some parties from the remote stations may take more time to return.Thus it is only on the next day after polling (P+1), and in some cases two days (P+2) that the returning officers scrutinise Form 17, including any complaints and concerns, in the presence of candidates and their agents and enter the polling station-wise turnout data.Even this data may further get updated for any constituency where repoll is being conducted, on conclusion of repoll and arrival of parties.After complete data entry, the returning officers submit the constituency-wise data which is instantly visible on the voter turnout app.This time, for both the phases, the station-wise data was submitted on P+1 day. So while the turnout shown by the app at 12 midnight on April 19 and April 26 was 65.4%and 65.37%, respectively, the updated data submitted after all Form 17 records were scrutinised the evening after polling day was 66.14% for Phase 1 and 66.71% for Phase 2.“There was absolutely no delay in such disclosure on poll day... the narrative about non-disclosure of data is completely unfounded, without proper appreciation of the system in place,” a senior EC functionary said. “ Leave alone constituency, even booth data of votes polled is available with the candidates and cannot be changed at any stage.

Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for West Bengal, gave examples of land, water, forests and several other resources that could be acquired, even if privately owned, by the state for distribution of their benefits to the community at large.Dwivedi said, “Various expressions in these clauses of Article 39 have been used in the context of the operation of the economic system and the idea is to ensure that all the material resources are used to best subserve the common good, and to see that they do not cause common detriment.“These provisions are basically intended to operate with respect to material resources in the hands of private persons so as to ensure common good and not common detriment.”",Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Article 39(b) indirectly admitted the limitations of the generation of the day to fully fathom the nature and character of future dynamics of economic situations the country would face.

Hindu marriage invalid without customary rituals: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-marriage-invalid-without-customary-rituals-sc/articleshow/109763530.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that a Hindu marriage is a sacred process and not a “song and dance” and “wining and dining” event, Supreme Court has held that customary rituals and ceremonies prescribed under the Hindu Marriage Act must be assiduously, strictly and religiously followed, failing which a marriage would be declared invalid even after it has been registered.A SC bench said Section 7 of the Act lists ‘ceremonies of a Hindu marriage’, which have to be complied with for validity of the marriage and if it is not done, then the marriage is not deemed valid in the eye of the law. Section 7 says a Hindu marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction , the Supreme Court has observed and said it cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said a Hindu marriage is a ‘samskara’ and a sacrament which has to be accorded its status as an institution of great value in Indian society.In its recent order passed in the matter of two trained commercial pilots, who sought a divorce decree without performing a valid Hindu marriage ceremony, the bench urged young men and women to “think deeply about the institution of marriage even before they enter upon it and as to how sacred the said institution is, in Indian society”.“A marriage is not an event for ‘song and dance’ and ‘wining and dining’ or an occasion to demand and exchange dowry and gifts by undue pressure leading to possible initiation of criminal proceedings thereafter. A marriage is not a commercial transaction. It is a solemn foundational event celebrated so as to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who acquire the status of a husband and wife for an evolving family in future which is a basic unit of Indian society,” the bench said.Terming the marriage as sacred as it provides a lifelong, dignity-affirming, equal, consensual and healthy union of two individuals, the bench said a Hindu marriage facilitates procreation, consolidates the unit of family and solidifies the spirit of fraternity within various communities.“We deprecate the practice of young men and women seeking to acquire the status of being a husband and a wife to each other and therefore purportedly being married, in the absence of a valid marriage ceremony under the provisions of the (Hindu Marriage) Act such as in the instant case where the marriage between the parties was to take place later,” the bench said.In its April 19 order, the bench said where a Hindu marriage is not performed in accordance with the applicable rites or ceremonies such as ‘saptapadi’ (taking seven steps by the groom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage will not be construed as a Hindu marriage.“We further observe that a Hindu marriage is a sacrament and has a sacred character. In the context of saptapadi in a Hindu marriage, according to Rig Veda, after completing the seventh step (saptapadi) the bridegroom says to his bride, ‘With seven steps we have become friends (sakha). May I attain to friendship with thee; may I not be separated from thy friendship’. A wife is considered to be half of oneself (ardhangini) but to be accepted with an identity of her own and to be a co-equal partner in the marriage,” it said. In Hindu Law , marriage is a sacrament or a ‘samskara’ and it is the foundation for a new family, the bench noted, and said, “There is nothing like a “better-half” in a marriage but the spouses are equal halves in a marriage.”Observing that with the passage of centuries and the enactment of the Act, monogamy is the only legally approved form of relationship between a husband and a wife. “The (Hindu Marriage) Act has categorically discarded polyandry and polygamy and all other such types of relationships. The intent of the Parliament is also that there should be only one form of marriage having varied rites and customs and rituals,” it said.","A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction, the Supreme Court has observed. A Hindu marriage cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763532,imgsize-778899,width-400,resizemode-4/109763532.jpg"

"PIL seeks bar on namesake candidates, SC to hear plea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pil-seeks-bar-on-namesake-candidates-sc-to-hear-plea/articleshow/109763310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Does the age-old trick of political rivals , anticipating neck-and-neck contests, sponsoring namesakes of their principal rivals as phantom candidates constitute a corrupt electoral practice ? The question promises to set up an engaging debate in Supreme Court on Friday, considering some humdingers where the votes polled by the dummies exceeded the victory margin.A bench headed by Justice B R Gavai is scheduled to hear a PIL by one Sabu Steephen , who through counsel V K Biju said when every vote counted in determining the true mandate of people, Election Commission must treat the subterfuge of putting up namesakes to draw away votes which may have headed the rival’s way as corrupt electoral practice.He cited three instances from Kerala . One Satheeshan Pacheni lost by 1,820 votes while his namesake candidate polled 5,478 votes in 2009. That year, P A Mohd Riyas lost by 833 votes from Kozhikode, while four candidates with the name ‘Riyas’ cumulatively garnered 6,371 votes. In 2016, BJP state president K Surendran lost by 89 votes from Manjeswaram, where his namesake polled 467 votes.In the ongoing general elections, former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam faces four more O Panneerselvams, the petitioner said.“The petitioner is not claiming that all independent candidates are fake or that they have no right to contest. But EC must have an effective mechanism to weed out the phantoms set up to fraudulently wean away votes from a genuine candidate,” he said.The petitioner has sought direction from SC to EC to “take urgent and appropriate steps to assess the background of namesake candidates and their campaigns after submission of nomination forms” and create a mechanism to weed out the deliberately put up namesake or dummy candidates.",The question promises to set up an engaging debate in Supreme Court on Friday.

"India Inc has to deal with 1,536 Acts, 69,233 compliances: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-inc-has-to-deal-with-1536-acts-69233-compliances-study/articleshow/109763236.cms,"BENGALURU: Despite attempts to improve the ease of doing business , India Inc still has to deal with numerous laws and compliances.A research paper released by TeamLease RegTech , a regulatory compliance management firm, finds there are 1,536 Acts and rules , 69,233 compliances, and 6,618 annual filings to comply with. However, each company may not have to contend with all the compliances.That varies depending on the nature of business, geographical location and reach, and employee headcount.It says that a major part of the compliances for corporates is with regard to labour. Labour accounts for 30.1% of the applicable laws and rules, 47% of the compliances, 46% of the filings, and 68% of the provisions that carry clauses for imprisonment.Govt had sought to streamline several labour laws by enacting four labour codes but has failed to implement them, citing lack of support from some states. Most economists have argued that the new labour codes should be among the first set of key reforms that the new govt should implement.The current sets of laws and regulations come with their own set of internal processes with labour consultants seen to be heavily reliant on spreadsheets for data storage and sharing, the paper said.“Currently, the digitalisation of compliance processes is limited to monitoring and administrating regulatory obligations. Automation will enable businesses to reduce both the expense of compliance and the cost of poor compliance,” the report said.TeamLease RegTech pointed out that there is a lot of redundancy and overlap in labour laws.It suggested that companies and govt should start using open APIs so that they can exchange data seamlessly with regulators. “It will allow regulators to publish updates to compliance requirements, which affected businesses can quickly ingest. In addition, using a network of RegTechs, the infrastructure will enable enterprises to complete straight-through filings. Eventually, the grid will eliminate the need to create, maintain, and submit paper documents. It will automatically detect compliance obligation delays, evasions, and leaks,” TeamLease RegTech said.However, one company may not have to contend with all the compliances. That varies depending on the nature of business, geographical location and reach, and employee headcount.","Despite attempts to improve the ease of doing business, India Inc still has to deal with numerous laws and compliances.

Maldives foreign minister likely to visit India next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-foreign-minister-likely-to-visit-india-next-week/articleshow/109763177.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Maldives foreign minister , Moosa Zameer , is likely to visit India this month, TOI has learnt. Both sides are in touch diplomatically to finalise the dates for Zameer’s visit but official sources suggested it could happen as early as next week.If it happens, it will be the first high-level visit by either side since the Maldives’ pro-China president, Mohamed Muizzu, took office last year, defeating his India-friendly predecessor Ibrahim Solih.India’s ties with the Indian Ocean neighbour have taken repeated hits since then with Muizzu working to limit defence and security cooperation with India, most notably by asking the Indian government to pull out troops operating Indian choppers in the archipelago and by walking out of a bilateral agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.The visit will take place in the middle of the Indian parliamentary elections, making Zameer likely the last high-profile foreign dignitary India will host during PM Narendra Modi’s second term.The visit will also come around the May 10 deadline that Male had set for India to withdraw its troops and replace them with civilians. India reluctantly acquiesced to the demand, keeping in mind the geopolitical importance of the country which is where most of the major Indian Ocean shipping routes pass through and where China has made a dramatic comeback since Muizzu occupied the top office.Muizzu chose China for his first state visit in January, becoming also the first democratically elected Maldivian president to travel to the country before visiting India. He signed a number of agreements with Beijing during his visit and another later for free defence assistance from China.The visit will also follow the Maldives parliamentary elections that saw Muizzu strengthening his hold on power, with his ruling People's National Congress (PNC) winning a super majority in Parliament . The pro-India Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) was reduced to 12 seats in the elections.Zameer may discuss with his counterpart S Jaishankar the possibility of a visit by Muizzu to India later this year. Maldivian officials had earlier claimed they had proposed a visit by Muizzu to India in November, shortly after his oath-taking. He’s also likely to seek leniency from India in the repayment of loans taken by successive Maldivian governments. Muizzu, who wants to “restore” ties with India on the basis of respect for sovereignty, had earlier urged debt relief measures from India for the repayment of “hefty” loans.The 2 countries are also likely to discuss ways to carry forward defence and security cooperation. Muizzu will see in the parliamentary polls outcome a vindication of his decision to oust Indian troops but he has said as president earlier that he will continue to pursue defence cooperation with India on the basis of mutual respect and trust. In an interview to TOI in January, he had said India will continue to play a key role in supporting the Maldives in building the operational readiness of the Maldives National Defence Force.","Moosa Zameer is likely to visit India this month, TOI has learnt.

Except Rajasthan and east Madhya Pradesh, elections remain to be held in most of the high heat impact states.Though north and central India could escape heatwave days in April due to five western disturbances (WDs), India faced two spells of heatwaves last month - from April 5 to 7 and April 15 to 30 — affecting mainly eastern India and southeast Peninsular.The number of heat wave days in April was the highest during 2010- 2024 (15 years) over Gangetic West Bengal and highest over Odisha during 2017- 2024 (9 years). Records show that Odisha faced the longest spell of heatwaves during 15-30 April (16 days) after April 2016 when it prevailed for 21 days.Mohapatra attributed the prolonged heat wave in April in these two states to the absence of thunderstorms and a persisting anticyclone at lower levels over the west central Bay of Bengal and the adjoining eastern coasts of India.On the rainfall front, IMD predicted the average precipitation over the country as a whole in May to be normal. “The normal to above-normal rainfall is likely over most parts of northwest India, some parts of central, peninsular and northeast India. The below normal rainfall is likely in remaining parts of the country,” it said.Although there are some exceptions, where ‘normal’ to ‘below normal’ max temperatures are likely, a vast area coinciding with nearly 200 LS seats which will vote over the next 4 phases is likely to face intense hot weather","In many states/UTs including Delhi, four of the remaining phases of parliamentary elections this month are likely to be held amid peak of hot weather.
