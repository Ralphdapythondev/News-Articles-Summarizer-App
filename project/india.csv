Cutting close to deadline

NEW DELHI: After weeks of suspense, the Congress on Friday finally declared its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.The Congress, which is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing deal with the Samajwadi Party (SP), had announced candidates for all the seats barring Amethi and Rae Bareli.Rae Bareli is also a bastion of the Congress. From 1967 to 1977, the seat was held by former prime minister Indira Gandhi, and from 2004 until her appointment to the Rajya Sabha in 2024, by Sonia Gandhi .Rahul will file his nomination from the constituency on Friday. He will be pitted against BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh. He had been fielded by the party from the seat in 2019 too.Singh had lost to Sonia by a margin of 1.67 lakh votes.On being selected again to fight from Rae Bareli, Singh said: ""I assure the country that farewell of 'nakli' Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP's 'lotus' will bloom, and Congress will lose. I have even fought against 4-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi are not important to me. Whichever Gandhi comes to Rae Bareli, they will lose.""The announcement comes on the last day for filing of nominations for Phase 5 of the Lok Sabha elections. Both the constituencies are going to the polls on May 20.Rahul's defeat in Amethi, once considered a Congress 'pocket borough', at the hands of Irani in the 2019 polls was seen as a significant blow to the party's national prestige. Irani won the seat by a margin of around 55,000 votes.Rahul represented Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019. His father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, too, was an elected member of Amethi in the Lower House from 1981 till his death in 1991. Sonia Gandhi contested elections from here in 1999 before passing the baton on to Rahul in 2004.Rahul currently represents Wayanad in the Lok Sabha while Irani is bidding for a fresh term from Amethi.(With inputs from agencies)",Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.

HYDERABAD: Even before she was born, scans showed several “bends” in Vijaya Deepika Gangapatnam’s bones. Her father says the 13-year-old is like “glass” because of her rare Brittle Bone Disease that led to 45 fractures . Yet, her life now seems to have more “steel” than “glass” as she turns the tables on fate to become a para TT player.Vijaya was the youngest to win a medal at the UTT Para Table Tennis National Championship in Indore this March -- silver in singles and bronze in doubles.Vijaya means victory and the bespectacled home-schooled girl from Alwal in Secunderabad was drawn to table tennis because elder brother Vijaytej (20) played tennis and would travel for tournaments. Given her condition, though, her father Vijay Bhaskar Raju introduced Vijaya to TT at home.She suffered fractures even during delivery as doctors didn’t know she was already suffering from the disease, Bhaskar, a defence accounts auditor, says as he recalls daughter Vijaya’s pre-birth scan that showed feeble bones.Vijaya suffered most of her fractures while crawling as a toddler. “Her body weight was on her hands. Now, she uses different wheelchairs at home and to play. While changing wheelchairs, she fell a few times and fractured her legs and hands. She slipped many times in the bath and broke her legs,” Bhaskar adds.It was an ordeal for Vijaya to walk till she turned seven and her fractures led to hip and knee surgeries . These affected her movements, requiring her to take help for most day-to-day chores. “We have to take care of her like glass,” Bhaskar says.Unlike other teens, Vijaya can’t go to school because of her multiple surgeries and risk of further injury. “My parents and brother are very supportive . They teach me at home. I plan to write my Class X exams through open school this year or next,” she says.Mother Aruna recalls that one of Vijaya’s fractures occurred when she fell trying to reach an upper berth in a train. They were travelling to one of Vijaytej’s tennis tournaments. “We carry crepe bandages and painkillers all the time,” Aruna says.While Vijaytej hit the courts, Vijaya took to table game. In Indore where she took the second spot, she lost only to Bhavina Patel, the silver medallist at the 2020 Paralympics. Vijaya says she now dreams of representing India and winning a medal at the Paralympics.Bhaskar outlined the challenges . “She is ranked No. 3 in nationals. To compete in Paralympics, she needs to play in international tournaments. Travelling is costly and we are looking for sponsors to achieve her dream,” he says",Vijaya Deepika Gangapatnam has Brittle Bone Disease that led to 45 fractures. 13-year-old was the youngest to win a medal at the UTT Para Table Tennis National Championship in Indore this March -- silver in singles and bronze in doubles.

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: BJP has persuaded controversial incumbent in Kaiserganj, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, to yield in favour of his younger son, Karan , while also repeating the candidature of UP minister Dinesh Pratap Singh from the Nehru-Gandhi family stronghold of Rae Bareli .By sidelining Brij Bhushan, the former Wrestling Federation of India chief who has been accused of sexual harassment by woman wrestlers, BJP has sought to neutralise the charge that it was soft on the six-time MP.Although the leadership had made plain its intent by withholding the candidature for the seat, Brij Bhushan did not give up hope and had already started campaigning by taking out roadshows.Apart from winning Kaiserganj thrice in a row (2009, 2014, 2019), Brij Bhushan has won from neighbouring constituencies Gonda (1991 and 1999) and Balrampur (2004). His wife, Ketaki, one of the options considered by BJP, had won from Gonda in 1996 while his son Prateek is an MLA. Brij Bhushan exerts clout through nearly 54 educational institutions he owns or is closely associated with. These institutes dot both sides of a roughly 100km stretch of the Ayodhya-Gonda highway connecting four districts — Gonda, Balrampur, Bahraich and Shravasti.In Rae Bareli, this is the second time that Dinesh Singh, a former Congressman who used to be a confidant of the Gandhis, will be contesting. In 2019, he contested against Sonia Gandhi but lost by over 1.7 lakh votes.The contest has taken a turn with Sonia opting out of LS polls and taking the Rajya Sabha route to Parliament from Rajasthan. BJP, according to sources, is banking on Dinesh Singh’s connect with grassroots functionaries, especially at the village and block level.“I assure the country that the farewell of ‘nakli’ Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP’s lotus will bloom and Congress will lose. I have fought against four-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are not important to me.

Kharge

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday recounted the challenges he has set for the Congress and said that the party's silence in the matter means ""there is something fishy"".Addressing a public rally in Gujarat's Jamnagar, PM Modi said: ""It has been 9 days since I have challenged the Congress, and they haven't given me a reply on the same...They are quiet, which means something is fishy"".Besides challenging the Congress to categorically state that it will reinstate Article 370 and revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, if it comes to power, PM Modi took the Congress to task over religion-based reservation.""My first challenge is, will the Congress give in writing that they will not change the Constitution and give reservations to Muslims based on religion? Second, will they give it in writing that they will not compromise with the rights of the SC, ST, and OBC by giving away their share of the reservation to Muslims? Will they give in writing that their state governments and their leaders will not run a hidden agenda to give reservations to Muslims?"" said the PM.""When Congress released its manifesto, I alerted the country, especially the intellectuals, that the Congress manifesto is a red alert for the country. I clearly said that I could see the image of the Muslim League in their manifesto, which many thought was a mere political statement ... The narratives that had been imposed during the partition of the country by the Muslim League, unfortunately, similar scenes are being seen today. INDI alliance leaders, in their rallies, are asking Muslim voters to go for vote jihad. And these words came from a very senior Congress leader coming from a very well-educated family,"" he added.""Congress is contesting these elections on two strategies. First, dividing society based on caste. Second, uniting their vote bank through politics of appeasement... Congress is now giving its all to its main motive in these elections. Congress wants to take away reservation from SC, ST, and OBC and give it away to Muslims based on religion, by changing the Constitution,"" said PM Modi.Responding to the challenges, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge reiterated the promises made by the Congress party in its public declaration for Lok Sabha elections 2024.In a letter to PM Modi, Kharge challenged PM Modi and the BJP for a debate on the party's manifesto.""The Congress Party would like to challenge you or anyone you depute to debate with us on our manifesto and the points you have made,"" he wrote.Referring to the letter written by PM Modi to NDA candidates ahead of the third phase of voting, asking them to raise awareness about Congress' 'divisive' agenda, Kharge wrote: ""From the tone and content of the letter it seems that there is a lot of desperation and worry in you which is leading you to use language that does not suit the office of the Prime Minister. The letter makes it look like the lies in your speeches are not having the effect you intended and now you want your candidates to amplify your lies. Repeating a lie a thousand times will not make it the truth"".In his response to PM Modi's accusation that the Congress would divert resources from SC, ST, and OBC communities to its ""votebank,"" Kharge clarified that the ""Vote Bank"" encompasses all Indians, including the disadvantaged, women, youth with aspirations, the working class, Dalits, and Adivasis.""Our votebank is every Indian - the poor, the marginalised, the women, the aspirational youth, the labour class, the Dalits and the Adivasis. Everyone knows it is the RSS and BJP who opposed reservations at every stage since 1947. Everyone knows it is the RSS and BJP which wants to change the Constitution to end reservation. Your leaders have openly spoken about it. You need to clarify why you are opposed to reservation to SC, ST and OBCs on the basis of their population as per Article 16 of our Constitution,"" he stated in the letter.",PM Modi challenged Congress to state that it will reinstate Article 370 and revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if it comes to power.

This decision comes as Brij Bhushan Singh , who has represented Kaiserganj three times in the past, has been omitted from the party's ticket this time.The exclusion of Brij Bhushan Singh follows allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him, particularly by female wrestlers, prompting widespread protests, including those by prominent athletes like Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat.

"Hindu Marriage Act: Hindu marriage invalid without customary rituals, SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-marriage-invalid-without-customary-rituals-sc/articleshow/109763530.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that a Hindu marriage is a sacred process and not a “song and dance” and “wining and dining” event, Supreme Court has held that customary rituals and ceremonies prescribed under the Hindu Marriage Act must be assiduously, strictly and religiously followed, failing which a marriage would be declared invalid even after it has been registered.A SC bench said Section 7 of the Act lists ‘ceremonies of a Hindu marriage’, which have to be complied with for validity of the marriage and if it is not done, then the marriage is not deemed valid in the eye of the law. Section 7 says a Hindu marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction , the Supreme Court has observed and said it cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said a Hindu marriage is a ‘samskara’ and a sacrament which has to be accorded its status as an institution of great value in Indian society.In its recent order passed in the matter of two trained commercial pilots, who sought a divorce decree without performing a valid Hindu marriage ceremony, the bench urged young men and women to “think deeply about the institution of marriage even before they enter upon it and as to how sacred the said institution is, in Indian society”.“A marriage is not an event for ‘song and dance’ and ‘wining and dining’ or an occasion to demand and exchange dowry and gifts by undue pressure leading to possible initiation of criminal proceedings thereafter. A marriage is not a commercial transaction. It is a solemn foundational event celebrated so as to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who acquire the status of a husband and wife for an evolving family in future which is a basic unit of Indian society,” the bench said.Terming the marriage as sacred as it provides a lifelong, dignity-affirming, equal, consensual and healthy union of two individuals, the bench said a Hindu marriage facilitates procreation, consolidates the unit of family and solidifies the spirit of fraternity within various communities.“We deprecate the practice of young men and women seeking to acquire the status of being a husband and a wife to each other and therefore purportedly being married, in the absence of a valid marriage ceremony under the provisions of the (Hindu Marriage) Act such as in the instant case where the marriage between the parties was to take place later,” the bench said.In its April 19 order, the bench said where a Hindu marriage is not performed in accordance with the applicable rites or ceremonies such as ‘saptapadi’ (taking seven steps by the groom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage will not be construed as a Hindu marriage.“We further observe that a Hindu marriage is a sacrament and has a sacred character. In the context of saptapadi in a Hindu marriage, according to Rig Veda, after completing the seventh step (saptapadi) the bridegroom says to his bride, ‘With seven steps we have become friends (sakha). May I attain to friendship with thee; may I not be separated from thy friendship’. A wife is considered to be half of oneself (ardhangini) but to be accepted with an identity of her own and to be a co-equal partner in the marriage,” it said. In Hindu Law , marriage is a sacrament or a ‘samskara’ and it is the foundation for a new family, the bench noted, and said, “There is nothing like a “better-half” in a marriage but the spouses are equal halves in a marriage.”Observing that with the passage of centuries and the enactment of the Act, monogamy is the only legally approved form of relationship between a husband and a wife. “The (Hindu Marriage) Act has categorically discarded polyandry and polygamy and all other such types of relationships. The intent of the Parliament is also that there should be only one form of marriage having varied rites and customs and rituals,” it said.","A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction, the Supreme Court has observed. A Hindu marriage cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763532,imgsize-778899,width-400,resizemode-4/109763532.jpg"

The Union and DoPT have nothing to do with registration of cases by CBI, probe and prosecution of a case. We do not have administrative and supervisory power over CBI. I cannot supervise and tell the agency on registration of cases or how to investigate or whether to file closure reports or chargesheet. It is a separate statutory entity, supervised by another statutory body CVC,” Mehta submitted, adding that CBI is not an arm of the govt.Mehta said West Bengal govt had already approached SC challenging HC’s order directing CBI probe in various cases and it should not be allowed to file suit also for redressal of the same grievances, and accused the state for suppressing the fact.Taking note of SG’s submission, the bench asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal on how the state can file suit after it filed appeal against HC order. Sibal said the appeal was filed in individual cases and not on broader jurisdiction issues. Countering Mehta’s contention, Sibal said CVC has supervisory control over CBI only in corruption cases but it is Centre which controls the agency in the rest of the cases.

"At UN debate, India backs full membership of Palestine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-un-debate-india-backs-full-membership-of-palestinian-state/articleshow/109798620.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the US last month vetoed a resolution in the Security Council seeking full membership of the UN for Palestine, India Wednesday backed Palestine’s bid, expressing hope the endeavour will soon get endorsed. Palestine is currently a ``permanent observer state’’ at the UN with no power to vote on resolutions and decisions.A full membership will allow the global body to recognise a Palestinian state .The US, which supports a 2-state solution, had vetoed the resolution in the Council, saying its vote did not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood, but instead was an acknowledgment that it will only come from direct negotiations between the parties. While the UK and Switzerland had abstained, the 12 remaining members had voted in favour.Participating in a debate on the use of veto, the Indian ambassador, Ruchira Kamboj, noted that Palestine’s application for membership at the UN was not approved by the Security Council because of the US veto.``I would like to state here at the very outset that in keeping with India’s longstanding position, we hope that this would be reconsidered in due course, and that Palestine’s endeavour to become a member of the UN will get endorsed,’’ said Kamboj, while announcing India’s intentions of participating actively in an emergency special session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on the same issue.The Security Council resolution would have allowed the UNGA, UN’S most widely represented body, to vote for Palestine’s full membership. Israel has said nothing exemplifies the UN’s ``rotten values’’ more than the advancement of a Palestinian statehood.While espousing the Palestinian cause in the UN, India has for long strongly backed the Palestinian application for membership of the UN in the Security Council. India co-sponsored and supported the 2012 resolution in the UNGA on enhancing Palestine’s status from ‘Non-Member Observer Entity’ to ‘Non-Member Observer State’ in the UNGA.In 2011, then PM Manmohan Singh had said in a speech at the UNGA that India was looking forward to ``welcoming Palestine as an equal member of the United Nations’’. The same assurance was given to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas when he visited India next year.The top Indian diplomat at the UN also backed the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2728 in March demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan. She said it is imperative that humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza is scaled up immediately in order to avert a further deterioration in the situation. ``We urge all parties to come together in this endeavour,’’ she said. While reiterating India’s unequivocal condemnation of the terror attacks in Israel on October 7, Kamboj also underscored that international law and international humanitarian law must be respected by everyone under all circumstances.","The US last month vetoed a resolution in the Security Council seeking full membership of the UN for Palestine.

"Mama, Maharaja & Raja make MP’s Round-3 battle of bigwigs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mama-maharaja-raja-make-mps-round-3-battle-of-bigwigs/articleshow/109798581.cms,"BHOPAL: The third phase of LS elections is a blockbuster round for Madhya Pradesh. It will decide the political future of three bigwigs — ‘ Maharaja ’ Jyotiraditya Scindia , ‘bacchon ke mama and behno ke bhaiyya’ Shivraj Singh Chouhan and ‘raja’ of Raghogarh Digvijaya Singh aka Diggy Raja. Scindia, the Union aviation minister, returns to Guna to try to reclaim the family seat after his shock loss to former aide K P Yadav in 2019.He had won four times from the seat that has traditionally voted for the Scindias — from ‘Rajmata’ Vijayraje to Madhavrao and Jyotiraditya — and hadn’t expected to be the first to lose it. That, too, by over 1.25 lakh votes. The equations have changed since. Scindia quit Congress in March 2020 and is now the BJP candidate . Yadav, hailed as a hero by BJP in 2019, finds himself sidelined and understandably not very pleased. At a rally in Guna, Union home minister Amit Shah called Scindia “Maharaj” and appealed to voters to “not worry about K P Yadav” as BJP will take care of his future.“You will get two leaders,” he told the voters of Guna. “Jyotiraditya and K P Yadav.” “Jyotiraditya is BJP’s candidate. Among us, if any person is totally dedicated to development, then it is this Maharaj. The Scindia family has nurtured this region more than their children,” Shah said.Despite Shah’s campaign, Guna may not be easy for Scindia. One of the major reasons is the predominant Yadav vote bank which turned its back on him in 2019. Also, the Congress candidate , Rao Yadvendra Singh Yadav, is a former BJP worker with a Jan Sangh legacy. His father, Rao Deshraj Singh Yadav, had established the saffron party in Chambal and challenged Scindia in the 2002 LS bypoll, held after the demise of Madhavrao Scindia in an air crash.In the sympathy wave, Jyotiraditya defeated Deshraj by over 4 lakh votes. Deshraj had also contested unsuccessfully against Madhavrao Scindia in 1999. His son, Yadvendra, recently switched to Congress after over two decades with BJP. He is also a member of Ashokenagar district panchayat. It’s again a family vs family contest with the sides switched.In Rajgarh, it’s Digvijaya’s homecoming after 30 years. He contested this seat thrice and won in 1984 and 1991. He was defeated in 1989 by Jan Sangh leader Pyarelal Khandelwal. In 1991, Singh defeated Khandelwal by just 1,470 votes. After becoming CM in Dec 1993, Digvijaya vacated Rajgarh seat. His brother Lakshman Singh won the bypoll that followed, and four more polls from Rajgarh, the last one on a BJP ticket in 2004. To prove his loyalty to Congress, Digvijaya fielded Narayan Singh Amlave as the party’s candidate against his brother in 2009 and personally campaigned to ensure Congress’ win.Amlave beat Lakshman by 24,388 votes. That was the last time Raghogarh royal family represented the seat. The Modi wave caught up with Rajgarh in 2014 and 2019 when BJP’s Rodmal Nagar, a local businessman close to RSS, won by margins of 2.2 lakh and 4.3 lakh. This is Digvijaya’s turf where the 77-year-old is known as Rajasahab. The Raja returned, albeit wounded, from Bhopal in 2019 when he lost to Malegaon blast accused Pragya Singh Thakur, BJP’s candidate.Diggy Raja is running a determined campaign, addressing public meetings and contacting voters in 25 villages a day. But it is a hard fight. Six of the eight assembly segments of Rajgarh have BJP MLAs. The only two Congressheld ones are Raghogarh, where his son Jaivardhan is the MLA, and Susner where Congress’ Bhairon Singh is the MLA. Jaivardhan won by a margin of 4,505 votes in the Nov 2023 assembly elections and Bhairon by 12,645 votes.Compared to Maharaja and Raja, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is sitting pretty in Vidisha — an impregnable BJP fortress last won by Congress in 1984. Before becoming CM, Chouhan represented Vidisha five times in LS from 1991 (when Atal Behari Vajpayee vacated it) till 2006. Chouhan returns to his LS seat after 18 years. Congress has fielded Pratap Bhanu Sharma, the last partyman to win Vidisha in 1980 and 1984. Vidisha is where Sushma Swaraj won by over 4 lakh votes in 2009 and 2014. In 2019, a relatively less known Ramakant Bhargava won by over 5 lakh votes.Mama Shivraj — chief minister for 16 years whose popularity hit the peak with Ladli Bahna Yojana — is targeting a victory margin of 8 lakh votes. If he achieves this, Chouhan will again emerge as the most popular political face of Madhya Pradesh despite not being chief minister anymore. At a public meeting in Betul last Wednesday, PM Modi said he was taking Chouhan to Parliament.“On May 7, there is an election in Vidisha where my brother Shivraj ji is the candidate. Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I used to work together in the organisation. When he was chief minister and I was chief minister, we used to work together. He went to Parliament when I used to work as general secretary. And now again I want to take him with me,” the PM said. This, however, means that Chouhan’s era in Madhya Pradesh is over; he will now return to central politics.","The third phase of LS elections is a blockbuster round for Madhya Pradesh.

NewsClick stand on Covid vax ‘terror act’: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/newsclick-stand-on-covid-vax-terror-act-cops/articleshow/109798166.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police chargesheet filed against NewsClick and its founder, Prabir Purkayastha , has accused him of actively seeking to “undermine the Indian govt’s efforts to develop a vaccine to combat Covid-19”. It claims “the actions were nothing but an act of terror as they aimed at public health, which is one of the touchstones of national security”.Purkayastha has been booked under anti-terror law UAPA.“Evidence gathered during the investigation paints a clear picture of a coordinated campaign to undermine India’s response to Covid-19, driven by a biased agenda and potentially influenced by external entities. Their malicious acts not only endangered the lives of individuals who chose not to get vaccinated due to the misinformation peddled by the accused, but it also threatened the overall public health and safety of the population,” it claims.In a statement, NewsClick said the allegations were completely baseless. “NewsClick and Prabir have not been involved in any terrorist act. Nor is there any evidence for the same. Prabir does not have links to any terrorist group. The timing of these reports makes it clear that they aim to prejudice public opinion and pending judicial proceedings. The chargesheet is nothing but a set of opinions of the investigating officer parading as ‘allegations’. These allegations will be firmly contested,” it said.The chargesheet has a reference to World War III and philosopher Marshall McLuhan, besides claims of a deeper plot to propagate “information warfare” as part of a transnational conspiracy. “The investigation has brought to life McLuhan’s saying that ‘World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation’,” the police said while elaborating on Purkayastha's association with China-based millionaire and CCP functionary Neville Roy Singham.According to the chargesheet, the probe revealed a conspiracy aimed at a deliberate creation of a false narrative against Citizen Amendment Act. “The end result of this deliberate misinformation campaign was seen from the beginning of Dec, 2019 and ran up to Feb 2020 in the physical manifestation of the deadly Delhi riots,” it alleges.","Delhi Police chargesheet filed against NewsClick and its founder, Prabir Purkayastha.

"Kharge’s Gulbarga gambit: 1 step back, 2 forward?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kharges-gulbarga-gambit-1-step-back-2-forward/articleshow/109797972.cms,"Kharge-Modi Battle

High Stakes

KALABURAGI: PM Narendra Modi ’s decision to kick-start the national campaign from Karnataka ’s Kalaburagi district was a calculated move, aimed at sending a clear message on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ’s home turf, which falls under Gulbarga Lok Sabha seat.At that time, none of the parties had released their list of candidates and speculation was rife that Kharge, who had suffered his first and only electoral defeat since 1972 in the last Lok Sabha elections, would refrain from contesting again.Kharge, 81, a Rajya Sabha member, eventually decided to stay off the ballot, marking a significant departure from his decades-long presence on Congress’s candidate lists for assembly and parliamentary elections from Gulbarga.Kharge not being in fray is being viewed as a significant development, affecting optics not just for Congress but also for the coalition of opposition parties — INDIA — that he was instrumental in stitching together. Some INDIA members had even pitched Kharge as a potential prime ministerial candidate to take on Modi. Some local Congress insiders feel Kharge not contesting in the backdrop of PM Modi challenging him and ensuring BJP won in Gulbarga in 2019 could further impact the party’s image in the region.But Karnataka minister and Kharge ’s son, Priyank, said, “His decision to not contest is strategic to consolidate and focus on other winnable seats for Congress, given his stature as a national leader whose influence transcends the confines of a single constituency.”Kharge, who has fielded his son-in-law, Radhakrishna, reiterated that he is at the forefront in Gulbarga and expressed confidence in INDIA coalition’s prospects nationally. “...These are, more than ever, people’s elections – people of India versus 10 years of antipeople policies of BJP, whose campaign will evaporate just like in 2004,” Kharge had told TOI a few weeks ago.“There’s no doubt about victory,” Radhakrishna says, as he battles BJP attacks and soaring temperatures – it was 45°C on April 30, when TOI visited. Priyank, a key figure in Congress’s campaign, says: “Things have improved with every passing day of our campaign. BJP cannot repeat its 2019 performance. Some communities, especially the Kolis and Kurubas, have now realised why they should vote for Congress.”The possibility of Kharge becoming PM in case of a fractured verdict has been speculated upon after his elevation as the chairman of INDIA coalition. Congress is even nursing ambitions of a post-poll alliance like in 2004. However, BJP has termed such anticipation “farfetched”, confident of returning to the treasury benches of Lok Sabha with greater numbers. Parliament has witnessed engrossing battles of wits and words between Kharge and Modi.On Feb 5, Modi told Parliament: “...Even Kharge ji is saying ‘this time, it’s Modi govt’. Mr Speaker, I usually don’t get caught up in statistics. But I can see the mood of the nation; it will ensure NDA crosses the 400-mark.”On Feb 7, he said: “I couldn’t say it that day, but I express special thanks to Kharge ji... I was listening very attentively to Kharge ji, and I was thrilled... One thing was very pleasing. I respectfully accept the blessing that he gave to NDA for 400 seats.”Kharge, too, has been taking on Modi on a variety of topics, ranging from economic policies and social issues to matters of national security and governance. Modi has been clear with his messaging, launching his first election campaign from Kharge’s Kalaburagi (Gulbarga seat), rather than his own seat (Varanasi) or perceived Congress strongholds, signalling the significance of the region and the challenge posed by Kharge.Former PM HD Deve Gowda had said, “If Congress wanted to make him the PM, it should have fielded him from Gulbarga... They didn’t make him CM even in 2018 when I had suggested it. Will they ever make him PM?”In Gulbarga, Kharge is engaged in a high-stakes battle to reclaim the seat he lost to BJP’s Umesh Jadhav — a friendturned-foe — in 2019.For Kharge, the defeat was an aberration as he held sway as an unbeatable Congress titan in the region until then. The Congress veteran, who played a crucial role in securing special constitutional status for Kalyana Karnataka region under Article 371(J), seems confident of defeating Jadhav, a Banjara who is seeking votes in PM’s name and Hindutva push.BJP is accusing Kharge of pandering to minority interests, while Congress is selling its secular, inclusive agenda, highlighting BJP’s “failures”. After SCs, Lingayats are the largest community in this reserved seat, with around 5 lakh voters, followed by Muslims and land-owning Kolis — Kabbaligas — having 2.5-3 lakh voters each. Both BJP and Congress are vying for the votes of Lingayats and Kabbaligas. A strong performance by Kharge in Gulbarga could reinvigorate Congress’s prospects in the region and prepare the ground for the next assembly polls’ fight.","Kharge, 81, a Rajya Sabha member, eventually decided to stay off the ballot, marking a significant departure from his decades-long presence on Congress’s candidate lists for assembly and parliamentary elections from Gulbarga.

MEA protests China’s road in Shaksgam Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mea-protests-chinas-road-in-shaksgam-valley/articleshow/109797676.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has registered a protest with Beijing for constructing a road in the Shaksgam Valley , which was ceded to China by Pakistan in 1963, asserting it is a part of Indian territory.The ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) said India has never accepted the so-called China Pakistan Boundary Agreement of 1963 through which Pakistan unlawfully attempted to cede the area to China, and India has consistently conveyed its rejection of the same.“We have registered our protest with the Chinese side against illegal attempts to alter facts on the ground. We further reserve the right to take necessary measures to safeguard our interests,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.

Sharad-Ajit shadow Pawarplay in Baramati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharad-ajit-shadow-pawarplay-in-baramati/articleshow/109797452.cms,"The Rise Of Pawar, & The Other Pawar

The uncle is the unquestionable king of this realm, his calculations never go wrong, and his political acumen is still relied on, overtly or covertly, for almost every decision in Maharashtra . The nephew, who has been quick on the uptake, has learnt every trick from him but his ambitions are clearly not in line with the clan’s precepts.In the last three decades, countless challengers have attempted to breach the Pawar dynasty’s bastion, yet electoral victory has always favoured the patriarch and NCP founder Sharad Pawar , or his chosen heirs.However, this time, the 83-year-old warhorse is not facing an external adversary but a shrewd insider, his nephew Ajit Pawar who seeks to test the limits of his dominance. Once the senior Pawar’s protegé, Ajit has broken away, taking along the party’s name and its symbol — a clock.Reigning over a fractured fortress — now called NCP (SCP) — Sharad Pawar has anointed his three-time MP daughter, Supriya Sule , to lead the charge from Baramati , which is the family’s citadel. Ajit Pawar, currently one of Maharashtra’s two deputy CMs, has fielded his wife, Sunetra Pawar .On the surface, it is a Supriya vs Sunetra battle, but it symbolises a desperate struggle for legitimacy and supremacy within Baramati’s most powerful family. Supriya has inherited splintered support and unfamiliarity among voters with a new symbol — ‘a man playing tutari’, and faces the formidable NCPBJP-Shiv Sena coalition, Mahayuti . While Sunetra has neither the voter connect nor the politician’s charisma. Political analyst Abhay Deshpande says Supriya may leverage the victim card while Sunetra, being a novice, can only bank on her husband’s track record.Additionally, Supriya faces antiincumbency sentiments, he says. Situation on the ground, meanwhile, seems favourable for Sunetra. Of the six assembly segments under Baramati Lok Sabha seat, four are with the governing Mahayuti — two with NCP and two with BJP; and two with Congress which, along with NCP (SCP), is part of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). So, in Baramati LS seat, Sharad Pawar’s faction does not have any MLA while his nephew’s group has two — Baramati assembly seat (which Ajit Pawar himself represents) and Indapur (NCP’s Dattatray Bharne).After former state ministers Harshvardhan Patil (BJP) and Vijay Shivtare (Shiv Sena), who holds sway in Indapur and Purandar and were earlier at odds with Ajit Pawar, declared their support for the deputy CM, he is now hoping to get support in Khadakwasla and Daund, the two assembly segments held by BJP. On the other hand, Supriya is counting on support from loyalists and sympathy for her father, besides votes from the two Congress-led assembly constituencies of Bhor and Purandar.A look at Sharad and Ajit Pawar’s career graphs shows that they both had humble beginnings and meteoric rises. In the early 1960s, Yashwantrao Chavan, the then chief minister, spotted potential in Sharad Pawar during his college days in Pune. Sharad Pawar grew influential in Youth Congress and at 27, he won his first assembly polls from Baramati, followed by becoming Maharashtra’s youngest CM and getting central ministerial berths.Under his uncle’s guidance, Ajit started as a director in a sugar cooperative. In 1991, he made his political debut and won the Baramati LS seat. However, he had to resign later to accommodate his uncle’s central ministerial duties. Rising swiftly, Ajit secured the Baramati assembly seat and became a minister in Sudhakarrao Naik-led Congress govt in Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar splitting from Congress in 1999 and forming NCP further spurred Ajit’s ascent.Becoming a key figure, Ajit extended his influence statewide while his uncle focused on national affairs. Through all of this, the uncle-nephew rivalry, even if subdued, existed, political analysts say. It reached its peak in 2019 when a rebellious Ajit Pawar marched to Raj Bhavan and took oath as the deputy CM, aligning with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as the CM. This honeymoon proved shortlived and Ajit returned to the fold. The cracks, however, remained.“Within NCP, there were always two factions. This led to frequent power struggles between the two. The fact that Ajit is scarcely mentioned in his uncle’s autobiography, ‘Lok Maze Sangati’, points to the long-standing differences between them,” says Prakash Pawar, professor of political science at Shivaji University, Kolhapur.In 2023, Sharad Pawar declared he would step down as NCP’s national president, a position Ajit vied for. Later, he reversed this decision following overwhelming demand from followers. Eventually, in July that year, Ajit decided it was time to fulfil his ambitions and joined the Eknath Shinde-led govt, along with a group of MLAs and MLCs. The Baramati seat, with the Pawars since 1996 (Sharad Pawar from 1996 to 2009 and Supriya Sule from 2009 to 2019), is the only Maharashtra seat which will see a woman vs woman battle.","Sharad Pawar has anointed his three-time MP daughter, Supriya Sule, to lead the charge from Baramati, which is the family's citadel.

I presume you all know what the meaning of ‘jihad’ is,” PM told a gathering in Anand, Gujarat’s milk city. “Worse, not a single Congress functionary has condemned it yet.”Modi also tore into Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge for his allegedly disparaging remarks about Ram and Shiva devotees, accusing him of trying to create a rift among Hindus in pursuance of his party’s “appeasement” of Muslims.At an election rally in Surendranagar, the PM said, “Congress chief Kharge has made a very dangerous statement with malafide intentions. They (Congress) aim to create differences among devotees of Ram and Shiva so that they fight with each other. Even the Mughals could not break our traditions dating back thousands of years, but now Congress wants to break it?”Modi iterated that the Congress manifesto smacked of “Muslim League’s declarations”, carrying forward its intent to grant reservation based on religion to Muslims for three decades.“Congress betrayed the Constitution...Its manifesto proposes a separate quota for minorities, especially Muslims, in the allocation of all govt tenders,” he said“Govt contracts are not awarded based on caste or religion. But Congress wants to do that for its vote bank. Govt buys arms and ammunition for our Army from private players. So, are we going to give contracts to people from a specific religion or select qualified contractors?”Declaring that nobody would be able to divide the country until he was alive, the PM announced the launch of a nationwide campaign to spread awareness about the Constitution after the vote count on June 4.“I will expose this gang that wants to alter the Constitution. I will reach out to people living in every corner of the country. It's time we teach a lesson to these people,” he said.Modi addressed four rallies covering Anand in central Gujarat and several constituencies of Saurashtra, including Junagadh, Jamnagar and Surendranagar.","PM said he found the remark of Maria Alam, SP candidate and niece of Congress veteran Salman Khurshid, at a rally in UP all the more shocking as it came “from a person belonging to an educated Muslim family and not someone who studied in a madrassa” PM also picked on a Pakistan ex-minister’s praise for Rahul Gandhi on X as a reflection of the neighbour's “desperation to see the shehzada become the next PM so that India gets a weak govt”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109796324,imgsize-983824,width-400,resizemode-4/109796324.jpg"

Morena votes in the third phase on May 7.A week ago, in Morena, PM Narendra Modi had said: “It was widely said that when Indira Gandhi passed away and her son Rajiv Gandhi had to get her property, as PM, he abolished the inheritance law of that time to save his property and ensure the money didn’t go to govt.” Priyanka chose Morena for her rebuttal.“At the age of 19 years, I was annoyed with this country when I brought my martyred father’s remains home. I thought it was your duty to keep him safe. You returned me these fragments as his remains. And those fragments were wrapped in the national flag,” she said.“I know what martyrdom means. Today, I am 52, and I’m saying this for the first time in public. How do I make you understand how much love I have for my country? When Modi ji stands on the dais and calls my father a ‘traitor’, when Modi ji says that my father changed a law to take inheritance from his mother, he will never realise that my father did not get riches and wealth as inheritance. My father got the sentiments of martyrdom as inheritance,” she said. “You would understand as you are the farmer who has irrigated the land of this country with your sweat, you have sent your son to the borders of this country. When your son is martyred, I know how you feel because I feeling the same,” Priyanka said.“Modi ji who speaks whatever he wants against Indira Gandhi. He can only see a dynasty, he cannot see patriotism and service to the nation. He cannot understand this feeling. They call us traitors, throw us out of our homes. They removed my brother from Parliament and have filed so many cases against him across the country. They can do anything, even kill us, but they cannot take this feeling away from us,” she argued.","“My father inherited martyrdom,” she said at an election rally in MP ’s Morena.

Congress altered quota system several times to benefit Muslims: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-altered-quota-system-several-times-to-benefit-muslims-bjp/articleshow/109796042.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to senior Congress veteran P Chidambaram’s claim that PM Narendra Modi continued to fight ghosts in his election speeches on the quota issue , BJP on Thursday circulated a long list of occasions when the quota system was altered especially to benefit the Muslim community .“Congress ensured that SC/ST reservation , as mandated by the Constitution, was removed from Aligarh Muslim University (1981) and Jamia Millia Islamia (2011) in favour of Muslims, even though both are govt funded.Congress also ensured that ‘minority’ institutions, even if state funded, don’t have to provide reservations for SC/ST/OBCs,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said as he posted a list of times when the quota structure was altered. He said not just this, Congress tried to give reservation to Muslims in Andhra Pradesh five times but the courts struck it down every time.After citing several attempts by Congress to introduce 5% Muslim quota in govt jobs and educational institutions between 2004-14, BJP claimed that in June 2013, then minority affairs minister K Rahman Khan said UPA was committed to implement a 4.5% Muslim quota. “Finally, the UPA govt went to SC to plead for Muslim reservation. The SC clubbed the central Muslim quota case of UPA govt with the Andhra Pradesh Muslim quota case and heard the matter through a constitutional bench,” Malviya said.Rebutting Chidambaram’s claim, Malviya said the 2024 Congress manifesto unequivocally implied Muslim reservation. “For instance, what is the difference between Point 3 and Point 6 in the minorities section of the manifesto? Point 3 says ‘encourage’ minorities to take full advantage of opportunities. If the Congress manifesto had limited itself to just this, it would have been okay. But Point 6 says ‘ensure’ minorities receive ‘fair share’ on exactly the same issues as mentioned in Point 3,” Malviya said.Meanwhile, Baby Rani Maurya, a senior minister in Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet and a known Dalit face, cited the several positions she held, from governor to a senior minister, and said Congress and its allies should respond to Modi’s “challenge” that there will not be any alteration in the quota system to accommodate Muslims for their politics of appeasement and vote bank.","BJP circulated a long list of occasions when the quota system was altered especially to benefit the Muslim community. “Congress ensured that SC/ST reservation was removed from Aligarh Muslim University (1981) and Jamia Millia Islamia (2011) in favour of Muslims,” BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109796038,imgsize-2481642,width-400,resizemode-4/109796038.jpg"

KOLKATA: A Raj Bhavan employee on Thursday evening filed a complaint of molestation against Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose, introducing an element of the unprecedented in state politics and pitting the Trinamool govt and the governor’s office in direct conflict in the middle of a seven-phase election season,andThe woman , according to Raj Bhavan insiders, works in the telephone room and stays at the residential quarters on the campus. She first went to the Raj Bhavan police outpost before 7pm Thursday, from where she was taken to Hare Street police station.The governor issued a statement a couple of hours later, saying he would not be “cowed by engineered narratives”.The woman’s complaint to cops mentions two incidents. It says that Bose asked her on April 19 to meet him with her CV. She went to meet him on April 24 at 12.45pm, when he “touched her inappropriately and made untoward advances”, the complaint says. Bose again called her to his office on Thursday but the woman, instead of going alone, asked her supervisor to accompany her. The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then “touched her cheek”, prompting her to protest.A video in circulation since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. “This is not the first time that this has happened to me,” she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: “I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job.” She said she felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident, to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.Senior cops later toldthey had recorded the woman’s statement but did not register any FIR. “Article 361 of the Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,” a senior official explained, adding that legal experts would be consulted on Friday.In its first statement, Raj Bhavan said: “Truth shall triumph. I refuse to be cowed by engineered narratives. If anybody wants some election benefits by maligning me, God bless them. But they cannot stop my fight against corruption and violence in Bengal.” Another statement issued a little later thanked Raj Bhavan staff “who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties’ agents”.A third release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and Bengal finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The statement said cops have been banned to prevent their entry “in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election”. The minister’s entry is banned in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore, but no reason has been attributed.The governor would not attend any finance department event, the statement said, adding that the attorney-general would be consulted for legal steps against Bhattacharya.Before the release of Raj Bhavan order banning her entry, Bhattacharya had condemned “the alleged misconduct by the governor”, which she called “unbecoming of any official, especially the head of State”. She demanded an immediate and a “thorough investigation”.PM Modi reached Raj Bhavan around 10pm, where he stayed the night. He is slated to leave Raj Bhavan Friday morning for campaigning in East Burdwan, Nadia and Birbhum.Earlier, Trinamool launched a blistering attack on Bose on X: “Appalling and unthinkable! The sanctity of Raj Bhavan, a symbol of our constitutionality, has been tarnished. Hours before the PM was supposed to arrive at Raj Bhavan to spend the night, a woman was allegedly molested by the governor under the false pretext of a job. Such despicable behaviour must be condemned in the strongest terms. Justice must be delivered swiftly for the victim, no excuses, no delays!”","A Raj Bhavan employee on Thursday evening filed a complaint of molestation against Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose.
