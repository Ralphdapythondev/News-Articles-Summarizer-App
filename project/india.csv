Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Only FDI approval was remaining for the merger as all other nods from agencies like the Competition Commission and DGCA are already in place. Tatas will have remaining 74.9% stake in AI.After Govt FDI nod, AI-Vistara will shortly communicate timelines of the merger to passengers. People who have booked tickets on Vistara flights post the date of merger will be informed that their flight will be on Air India along with the changed flight number of AI and its time.Sources say the date of merger is likely to be after Diwali (Nov 1) as the airline will avoid taking any chances during the peak festive travel season. “There will be a decent window between post Diwali and the onset of fog that usually happens after Dec 20 which leads to flight disruptions. Ideally the merger should happen in that space to sort out any merger teething issues like informing passengers booked on Vistara their changed AI flight details before fog adds further complexity to the equation,” said sources.Vistara has 70 aircraft which will continue to fly in the airline’s livery. The same will changed to AI’s new livery when the aircraft go in for heavy checks. “Taking out aircraft just for painting purpose and letting capacity take a hit makes no sense. Also Vistara aircraft have a better cabin product than that of AI’s old planes,” said sources.Vistara had earlier reached out to passengers informing them about the transfer of frequent flyer miles to AI’s loyalty programme. The movement of personnel has already started, with many Vistara employees now operating from AI’s new Gurgaon headquarters.Are there chances that passengers who have booked on a certain class of Vistara, say business or premium economy, on a flight that has to operate after the date of merger being shifted to economy on the AI flight they take as the latter’s business may be full or it may not have a premium economy? “There are little chances of such things happening,” said sources.AI management had last considered toyed with the idea of postponing Vistara’s merger. The reason: They wanted AI planes to be upgraded first and till then retain Vistara as the better product carrier. However given mounting concerns among Vistara employees about AI officials getting all key posts in the merged airline, that plan was shelved. So even as AI remains very much a work in slow progress, the merger is now going to happen before the end of this calendar year.","The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India.

Vadhvan Port: PM Modi lays foundation stone for India’s largest deep-water port,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vadhvan-port-indias-largest-deep-water-port-pm-modi-foundation-stone-top-facts-highlights/articleshow/112913145.cms,"Here are the top facts about the port

Situated in close proximity to Dahanu town in Palghar district, Vadhvan Port is poised to become the largest deep-water port in the country. The port will offer direct access to international shipping routes, thereby reducing transit times and associated costs.

The primary objective of the port is to establish a world-class maritime gateway that will boost the country's trade and economic growth.

The port will cater to large container vessels, offer deeper drafts, and accommodate ultra-large cargo ships.

Vadhvan port will be equipped with deep berths, efficient cargo handling facilities, and modern port management systems.

Vadhvan Port is expected to enhance India's maritime connectivity and further strengthen its position as a global trade hub.

The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

The proposed location for the Vadhvan Port is in the Dahanu Taluka of Palghar district, and it will be developed as a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and the Maharashtra Maritime Board. The port is expected to cover an area of 17,471 hectares, with 16,906 hectares falling within the port limits.

The Vadhvan Port is anticipated to alleviate some of the pressure on the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is currently the largest container handling port in India.

The strategic location of the proposed port is considered advantageous due to its proximity to Gujarat, Rajasthan, and central India, as well as its accessibility to most of India's cargo destination locations.

The construction of the Vadhvan Port will involve the reclamation of 1,448 hectares from the sea, and it has been planned at a location with a deep draft of 20 metres. None of the major ports in India currently has a comparable draft, which limits the berthing of mega shipping vessels and results in certain shipping lines bypassing India. In comparison, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port has a draft of 15.5 metres, which is the deepest among the existing major ports in the country.

The project is anticipated to generate significant employment opportunities, stimulate local businesses, and contribute to the overall economic development of the region.

The development of Vadhvan Port incorporates sustainable practices, focusing on minimizing environmental impact and adhering to stringent ecological standards.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation for construction of the Vadhvan Port project , estimated to cost around Rs 76,000 crore, in Maharashtra 's Palghar.Before departing for Maharashtra, PM Modi called the 'Vadhvan Port project' a ""very special project""""A very special project that will contribute to India’s development. It will also reaffirm Maharashtra’s pivotal role as a powerhouse of progress,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.","The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

She stressed the need for exemplary punishment for perpetrators to act as a deterrent and urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action.In her second letter, Mamata Banerjee expressed disappointment over the lack of a direct response from the Prime Minister to her first letter, which she deemed critical in light of the ongoing situation in West Bengal. She acknowledged receiving a reply from the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Annapurna Devi, but criticized the response for not adequately addressing the gravity of the issue. Banerjee emphasized that the seriousness of the subject and its relevance to society had not been fully appreciated in the minister's reply.""You may kindly recall my letter No.44-CM dated August 22, 2024, regarding the need for stringent Central legislation on incidents of rape and meting out exemplary punishment to perpetrators of such crimes. No reply was received from your end on such a sensitive issue,"" Mamata Banerjee wrote in her letter to PM Modi.The BJP strongly criticized Mamata Banerjee's approach, with party leaders accusing her of attempting to mislead the public. BJP leader Amit Malviya took to social media, calling Mamata Banerjee a ""liar"" and accusing her government of failing to implement the stringent rules already in place for the protection of women and children. The BJP also urged the West Bengal government to act with honesty and integrity in handling such sensitive issues.On August 9, the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar hospital led to a political storm in West Bengal. The incident sparked widespread outrage, with protests erupting across the state. The tragedy has fueled accusations of negligence against Mamata Banerjee's government, further intensifying the already tense relationship between the state and the Centre.","Union minister of women and child development Annapurna Devi responded to Mamata Banerjee's second letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She said that information contained in her letter is ""factually incorrect"" and suggested that it aims to ""cover up delays"" in the operationalization of Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in the state. The letter came after MamataBanerjee wrote to the Prime Minister for the second time, expressing frustration over the lack of a direct response to her initial plea.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112934252,imgsize-2386939,width-400,resizemode-4/112934252.jpg"
Zelenskyy proposes summit in India to push plan to end Russia-Ukraine war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ukraine-floats-india-summit-to-push-plan-to-end-russias-war/articleshow/112930579.cms,"Swiss summit falls short



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy has proposed holding a summit in India aimed at ending the war with Russia , according to people familiar with the matter.The proposal was put to PM Narendra Modi during his visit to Ukraine last week, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private talks.Zelenskiyy aims to hold a second leaders meeting before the US presidential election in November as a follow-up to a summit in June, which sought to win support from nations of the Global South for Kyiv in its 2 1/2 year war with Russia.A gathering in India, which has been wary of the Ukrainian initiative because it so far excludes Russia, would be viewed as progress in Kyiv. PM Modi, who during his Aug. 23 visit signaled his backing for Ukrainian sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders, has yet to agree to host a meeting, the people said.PM Modi has signaled his willingness to play a “constructive role” in a peace process, though it’s “too early to comment on specific modalities and pathways at this stage,” Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesman for ministry of external affairs said in response to a query.The diplomatic effort has taken on new urgency as Russian forces gain ground in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and Ukraine’s military made a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region this month. With both sides on the offensive, adiplomatic resolution to the full-blown conflict that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 remains a distant prospect.A Zelenskiyy spokesman, Serhiy Nykyforov, said Ukraine is weighing holding the follow-up summit in a country of the Global South, including India “in particular.”Zelenskiyy seeks to win broader global support for his 10-point peace blueprint, including a demand to withdraw all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, and isolate Russia before beginning direct talks. But nations of the Global South have demanded that any forum that pushes for peace can only gain traction if Moscow has a seat at the table.Ukraine has expressed openness to including Russia in the process, though the Kremlin has repeatedly made clear it has no intention of engaging with Kyiv’s blueprint.The June 15-16 summit hosted by Switzerland, which drew more than 100 countries and organizations, fell short in its ambition to cement global support. China didn’t attend, while India joined delegations including Indonesia and South Africa in declining to sign the final communique.Zelenskiyy raised the issue during Modi’s visit, seeking India’s signature, the president’s spokesman, Nykyforov, said, adding that the host of a second summit must have signed the text. The language in that document had already been narrowed to focus on specific issues — nuclear and food safety and the return of abducted children and prisoners — to win over maximum support.But India’s skepticism of Ukraine’s initiative is due to Russia’s exclusion, according to senior Indian officials familiar with the diplomatic exchanges who spoke on condition of anonymity. Modi’s government has made clear that a solution can only be found through dialog between the two sides, they said.Modi followed through with that message during his visit to Kyiv last week — the first by an Indian premier since Ukraine’s independence in 1991. Even as he offered his most direct support for the country’s territorial integrity, he stood by his call for a diplomatic resolution as the only path to peace.As the West has expressed outrage over Russia’s attack on its neighbor, India has maintained political and economic links with Moscow, which supplies India with cheap oil and weapons. PM Modi’s Kyiv visit followed a trip to Moscow last month for talks with President Vladimir Putin.That trip drew criticism from US and Ukrainian officials, particularly because it occurred on the same day that a deadly Russian missile strike hit a children’s hospital in Kyiv. But Modi informed Zelenskiyy this month that he had spoken to Putin — “looking him in the eye” — and told him that “this is not the era for war.”“I spoke my mind clearly that the solution to any problem cannot be found on the battlefield,” Modi said in Kyiv. He spoke with both US President Joe Biden and Putin about the war in Ukraine following his visit to Kyiv.The prospect for a summit that would involve Russia has also grown uncertain in the wake of the Kursk incursion. It was followed on Monday by Russia’s biggest aerial attack on Ukraine since the invasion began and targeted the country’s power infrastructure.Zelenskiyy said earlier this week that the move into the Kursk was part of a “victory plan” to force Moscow to end the war that he will present to Biden and the contenders for US presidency next month.At the same time, his army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted the attack has so far failed to blunt Russia’s push in the east, which increasingly threatens the city of Pokrovsk, the key military logistics hub for Kyiv’s military operations in the east.Moscow’s military commanders had no plan to send significant forces from Ukraine to the Kursk region, a person close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg last week.Russian military bloggers have claimed that Ukraine’s defenses in the region around Pokrovsk have gradually weakened. At the same time, some have worried that Kyiv may be holding forces back in order to launch counter attacks further south in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy has proposed holding a summit in India.

Indira's assassination

Who is Jagdish Tytler

Background of the case:

Forty years after the bloody anti-Sikh riots , Delhi court on Friday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to frame charges against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in the case that resulted in death of three persons in the 1984 massacre.Special CBI judge Rakesh Siyal said there was sufficient evidence against Tytler, a former union minister, to put him on trial.""Sufficient ground is there to proceed against the accused person,"" the judge said.The charges against Tytler and others have been filed under sections 147 (rioting), 109 (abetment of an offence) read with 302 ( murder ) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Operation Blue Star was a significant event in the history of India that took place in June 1984. It refers to the military operation ordered by the Indian government to remove Sikh militants, headed by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had fortified themselves inside the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab.The operation and the subsequent events caused a deep sense of mistrust and alienation among the Sikh community towards the Indira government. The Indian National Congress, which was seen as responsible for the military operation, faced significant backlash from Sikhs, which impacted the party's political fortunes in Punjab and other regions with a significant Sikh population.The fallout from Operation Blue Star resulted in a tragic event that altered the course of Indian history. PM Indira Gandhi was on her way to meet British actor Peter Ustinov for a documentary. Ustinov was going to interview her. As she walked through the garden of PM residence at 1 Safdarjung Road, her trusted bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh opened fired on Indira and she fell on the ground.She was rushed to the hospital and died hours later. Beant Singh was shot dead another guard Satwant Singh and conspirator Kehr Singh was sentenced to death.Indira's assassination triggered anti-Sikh riots in Delhi and other parts of the country, leading to widespread violence, loss of life, and damage to Sikh properties.During the riots, one of the names that cropped up was of Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, who was accused of leading a mob that killed three people in the Pul Bangash area in the capital.Jagdish Tytler, born on August 17, 1944, in Gujranwala, a city now located in Pakistan, is the son of James Douglas Tytler, who established several renowned educational institutions, including the Delhi Public School, the Summerfields School and the JD Tytler Higher Secondary School.Throughout his career, Tytler has represented India on various international platforms. He served as a one-man delegation to the United Nations Conference on alternative energy sources held in Yugoslavia and led the Indian delegation to the United Nations on multiple occasions.Tytler's political career began under the leadership of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, during whose tenure he held several ministerial positions, including Minister of Civil Aviation, Minister for Surface Transport, Minister for Tourism, Minister for Labour, and Minister for Food Processing.He also served as the Minister for Coal during the government led by PV Narasimha Rao.As an MP, Tytler represented the Delhi Sadar Parliamentary Constituency from 1980 to 1989 and again from 1991 to 1995.He also held the position of Minister of State for Overseas Indian Affairs (Independent Charge) and chaired the Committee for Environment and Science & Technology within the All India Congress Committee.On June 2, 2023, a Delhi court approved a supplementary chargesheet filed by CBI against Tytler in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.In April 2023, Tytler had appeared before the CBI and given samples of his voice in connection with the case for the Central Forensic Science Laboratory to examine.In May 2023, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Tytler in a case related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, alleging that he instigated the mob to attack a gurdwara in Delhi in which three Sikhs were burnt alive.",Jagdish Tytler is accused of instigating a mob to attack a gurdwara in Delhi in 1984. The mob killed three people in the Pul Bangash area in the capital.
