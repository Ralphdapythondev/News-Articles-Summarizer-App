Uttarakhand seizes land of UP MLA Raja Bhaiya’s wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-seizes-land-of-up-mla-raja-bhaiyas-wife/articleshow/114161154.cms,"DEHRADUN: In a move that has drawn attention amid the Uttarakhand govt’s consideration of a stringent law to safeguard agricultural land from acquisition by ‘outsiders’, the district administration of Nainital has confiscated over half a hectare (27.5 nali) of land belonging to Bhanvi Singh , the estranged wife of Uttar Pradesh MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, also known as Raja Bhaiya .The land, located under Kainchi Dham subdivision, was bought in 2006 for agricultural purposes, but no farming activity has taken place since.The revenue department initiated proceedings to seize the property after an inquiry. Despite challenging the action in the commissioner’s court and the board of revenue, Singh’s appeals were rejected.Naresh Aswal, a revenue department official, said Uttarakhand law mandates land purchased for agriculture must be used for that purpose within two years. “Our surveys indicated no agricultural activity on the land since 2006, prompting us to initiate the process of vesting the property in the govt,” he said.According to administrative sources, Singh had fenced the land with barbed wire to prevent encroachment, but after the lack of farming was noted, she was served a notice. After she lost her appeals, the state formally took possession of the land.Bipin Chandra Pant, Kainchi Dham sub-divisional magistrate, said the land is now under govt control and the fencing has been removed. The property is estimated to be worth between 14 crore and 15 crore.

: PM Modi

Underlining a “collective desire for restoration of peace and stability in West Asia and Eurasia as soon as possible”, PM Modi iterated that “solutions cannot be found in battlefields”, and that India, in fulfilling its responsibilities as a “vishwabandhu”, would continue to make every effort to contribute to peace efforts.“I come from the land of Buddha, and I have repeatedly said this is not the age of war.It’s essential to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and international laws,” he said while addressing the East Asia Summit in Laos Friday.In a message to Asean countries amid growing Chinese assertiveness, Modi said the region’s approach should be focused on development and not expansionism. He said a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific is crucial for progress of the entire region, and peace, security and stability in South China Sea are in the interest of Indo-Pacific region.We believe that maritime activities should be conducted in accordance with UNCLOS. Ensuring freedom of navigation and airspace is essential. A robust and effective Code of Conduct should be developed. And, it should not impose restrictions on the foreign policies of regional countries, said PM Modi.Calling for concerted action against terrorism, he said the menace poses a serious challenge to global peace and security. “To combat it, forces that believe in humanity must come together & work in tandem. And, we must strengthen mutual cooperation in the areas of cyber, maritime, and space,” he said. While endorsing Asean’s approach toMyanmar , Modi said India believes it is crucial to sustain humanitarian assistance and implement suitable measures for the restoration of democracy.“We believe that, Myanmar should be engaged rather than isolated in this process. As a neighbouring country, India will continue to uphold its responsibilities. Friends, the most negatively affected countries, due to ongoing conflicts in various parts of the world, are those from Global South,” he said, adding India has consistently supported the unity and centrality of Asean that is also pivotal to India’s Indo-Pacific vision and Quad cooperation.Underlining the severe impact of conflicts on Global South, PM highlighted that the path of dialogue and diplomacy based on a humanitarian approach must be adopted for peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world.","PM Modi said the region’s approach should be focused on development and not expansionism.

Ratan Tata's legacy





I dedicate my last years to health: Ratan Tata in Assam

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

"Congress reviews Haryana loss, to pause EVM attack till it has ‘enough evidence’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-reviews-haryana-loss-to-pause-evm-attack-till-it-has-enough-evidence/articleshow/114131317.cms,"To ‘avoid bad optics’, Hooda & Selja not invited to Congress meet

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

What is the Mahadev betting scam?

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the main promoters of the Mahadev betting app , is expected to be brought to India soon following his recent formal arrest in Dubai on the basis of an Interpol issued arrest warrant in a money laundering and fraud case.Chandrakar along with another promoter of the app, Ravi Uppal was detained in that country late last year following the ED 's request for issuance of a Red Notice (RN) against them.Sources said Chandrakar is expected to be either extradited or deported to India over the next few days after he was formally placed under arrest in Dubai recently.Red corner notices was issued against Chandrakar in October 2023 after the ED had moved a special court in Raipur, filed a chargesheet and obtained a non-bailable warrant against him.The Mahadev online betting scam, a complex web of illicit operations involving individuals from Bhilai, the steel city, and orchestrated from the UAE and various states in India, was uncovered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) following a series of raids in Chhattisgarh in 2023.The scandal, which unfolded during the previous Congress regime in Chhattisgarh, has since become one of the most significant controversies in the state.According to ED findings, the Mahadev online betting app was an unauthorized platform that facilitated illegal betting on various sports, including cricket and football, as well as other forms of gambling. Operating across India and internationally, the app attracted a large number of users with the promise of easy money.However, beneath the surface, it was allegedly involved in laundering vast sums of money, funnelling illegal earnings through a complex network of offshore accounts and shell companies.The ED's crackdown involved a series of high-profile raids across multiple locations, targeting individuals who wielded significant power during the Congress regime. These raids resulted in the seizure of incriminating evidence, including digital devices, financial records, and documents that revealed the extent of the app's illicit activities.The ED suspects that the betting app laundered over Rs 5,000 crores—a staggering amount that has raised concerns about the reach of such illegal operations within the Indian financial system.","Saurabh Chandrakar, the promoter of the Mahadev Online Book gaming-betting app, was arrested in Dubai.

MUMBAI: In one of the last cabinet meetings before the announcement of the assembly elections, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes and left immediately after tribute was paid to Ratan Tata Thursday.Thirty-eight decisions - many of them having major financial implications - were taken in the two and a half hours that the meeting continued for after he left.Chief minister Eknath Shinde presided over the meeting, and deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis was with him all the time.Insiders said it was possible he was unhappy with the state of affairs and the high number of urgent proposals being brought before the cabinet meeting at the last minute without prior circular. Over the past few weeks, the finance department has raised objections to several proposals moved in the cabinet.While Ajit Pawar could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts, NCP state unit chief and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Tatkare said there was no question of any friction in Mahayuti .""I was in Raigad and don't know what happened in the cabinet. But there is no question of any friction in the Mahayuti, and nothing should be read into anyone leaving the cabinet early if that has happened at all,"" Tatkare said.The state has already come under criticism for a slew of pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore announced in the budget, including the Ladki Bahin scheme. The expenditure on the Ladki Bahin scheme on its own is slated to be Rs 46,000 crore per year.The state is on a spree of clearing land allotments, subsidies and guarantees in the run-up to polls. The finance dept has already warned that fiscal deficit could be as high as Rs 2 lakh crore for 2024-25.The department has warned that the fiscal deficit had crossed 3% of the GSDP, the limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act.""This was probably first time that Ajit Pawar has left the cabinet like this. The exact reason is not known, but this is uncommon. His chair was vacant throughout the meeting,"" an official said.Over the last few weeks, fault lines have emerged between the Mahayuti partners - Shiv Sena and Ajit's NCP.","Ajit Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes.

NEW DELHI: The BJP Friday claimed that the opposition INDIA bloc was mulling to make the Leader of Opposition 's post in the Lok Sabha rotational. ""If the INDIA bloc feels that Rahul Gandhi is not able to handle this responsibility with full dedication, they will have to make that decision,"" BJP's Delhi MP Bansuri Swaraj said.Suggesting that there are many leaders in the opposition parties who are ""capable"" of handling the work of the LoP, the Delhi MP, however, said the onus is on the opposition to make that call as it is a ""internal matter"".The claim by the BJP comes as the Congress party has come under intense scrutiny from its allies in the bloc after the poll debacle in Haryana, where BJP defied the exit polls to emerge victorious for the third straight time.However, the claim has not been confirmed by the opposition parties so far. It is usually that only an MP from the single largest party in the opposition with at least 10 per cent seats can be appointed as the LoP. Rahul Gandhi was appointed as the LoP in the Lok Sabha with the Congress party emerging as the single largest opposition party in the House after the Lok Sabha results.The BJP MP made these remarks in response to questions regarding discussions about opposition parties potentially rotating the LoP position in the Lok Sabha.""Yes, absolutely. I have also heard that there is talk of making the post of Leader of Opposition rotational. But I would politely say that this is an internal matter of the opposition,"" Swaraj told a press conference at the party headquarters in Delhi.""Yes, there are definitely many leaders in the opposition parties who are quite capable of fulfilling the responsibility of the Leader of Opposition. If the INDI Alliance feels that Rahul Gandhi is not able to fulfill his responsibility with complete dedication, they should take such a decision,"" she added.Meanwhile, BJP's Amit Malviya hit out at Rahul Gandhi and held him responsible for the grand old party's performance in the recently concluded Haryana elections. The BJP spokesperson also urged the parties in the opposition bloc to relieve him of LoP duties.""According to media, Rahul Gandhi got up and stormed out of the Haryana review meet, blaming leaders for fighting amongst themselves,"" he wrote on X.If true, reflects poorly on Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, his ability to manage fluid situations, bring resolution, besides making him look petulant. Opposition parties should strip him off his status as LoP,"" he added.When asked whether the LoP's post could be made rotational, former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary explained that only a MP from the single largest opposition party in the House can be appointed as the Leader of Opposition, according to news agency PTI.The person whom the single largest opposition party wants to be appointed as the LoP is chosen by it only, he said.""Neither the government nor the Speaker have any role to play in it,"" Acharya was quoted as telling news agency PTI.","BJP claims that the opposition INDIA bloc was mulling to make the Leader of Opposition's post in the Lok Sabha rotational.

: Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson says in his memoir that when he first met PM Narendra Modi in London he felt “his curious astral energy”.Johnson says that in 2012, on his first trade trip to India as London mayor, the FCDO had told him not to meet Modi “because he was a Hindu nationalist”.Yet when he first met him outside City Hall a few years later, “he raised my arm and chanted something in Hindi, and I felt his curious astral energy”, Johnson writes in his book “Unleashed”.After Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, he travelled to India in April 2022 to wean India off Russia . He said the welcome he received was “like an orchestrated orgy of state-sponsored Beatlemania”. He said he understood “the reasons for India’s post-war non-alignment with the West” and “India’s dependence on Russian hydrocarbons”.“But I wondered if it was not time fora modulation, a rethink. Did India really want to be aligned with this pair of autocracies,” he writes, referring to Russia and China. He pointed out to the Indians that “Russian missiles were turning out to be less accurate statistically” than his first serve at tennis. “Did they really want to keep Russia as their main supplier of military hardware?” The trip was a success.“Overcoming the qualms of the MoD, who are always worried about India’s closeness to Russia, we agreed to work together on all kinds of military technology, from submarines to helicopters to marine propulsion units,” he writes.Johnson discloses a private conversation he had with Queen Elizabeth in Sept 2022 at Balmoral two days before she died. He told her about the “well-known” difficulties the UK govt was having in persuading India to “take a tougher line with the Russians” on the Ukraine war and she told him something Jawaharlal Nehru had told her in the 1950s. “‘He told me that India will always side with Russia, and that some things will never change. They just are,’” he quotes the Queen as saying.","Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson says in his memoir that when he first met PM Narendra Modi in London he felt “his curious astral energy” Johnson says that in 2012, on his first trade trip to India as London mayor, the FCDO had told him not to meet Modi “because he was a Hindu nationalist”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114157568,imgsize-802102,width-400,resizemode-4/114157568.jpg"

Here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-hires-hitman-to-murder-daughter-but-gets-killed-herself-heres-why/articleshow/114158564.cms,"AGRA: A 35-year-old woman who had hired a hitman to kill her 17-year-old daughter as she was ""fed up with the teen's behaviour"" ended up being murdered by the man. He turned out to be the girl's lover. The matter came to light after the older woman's body was found in a field under Jasrathpur police station of Etah district on Oct 6.After an initial probe by police established that the body was that of a woman called Alka (who goes by her first name), a resident of Allahpur under Nayagaon police station in Etah.Exasperated by her daughter's wayward behavior, Alka had hired Subhash Singh , 38, to kill her child without knowing that he was the teenager's lover, said police on Friday. Subhash and the woman's daughter were arrested on Wednesday night.Police said that Alka's daughter had eloped with a youth from their area a few months ago. Alka then sent her daughter to her maternal home in Farrukhabad. It was there that she started talking to Subhash for long hours over the phone and they soon developed a relationship. When her uncle noticed the calls, he asked Alka to take the girl home. Furious at the embarassment, Alka then decided to eliminate her daughter.On Sept 27, Alka contacted Subhash and offered him Rs 50,000 to kill her daughter, said police, adding Subhash shared the information with the girl, who promised to marry him if he killed her mother instead. ""During questioning, they confessed to the crime,"" said police.","Woman hired hitman to kill her 17-year-old daughter as she was ""fed up with the teen's behaviour"" He turned out to be the girl's lover.

NEW DELHI: To boost India’s surveillance system from space, the Cabinet Committee on Security led by PM Narendra Modi has quietly approved the phase III of the Space Based Surveillance ( SBS-III ) for launching a big bunch of spy satellites in low earth and geostationary orbits.“CCS on Monday gave the approval for launching 52 satellites under the SBS-III project, which would cost around Rs 27,000 crore,” a source in Isro toldIndia had already launched several spy or earth observation satellites under the SBS programme like Risat, Cartosat and Gsat-7 series satellites. The SBS-1 was first approved under the Vajpayee regime in 2001 under which four surveillance satellites were launched. Thereafter, six such satellites were launched under the second phase in 2013. The 50+ satellites, which are likely to be launched in five years, will boost the numbers of ‘eyes in the sky’, adding punch to the space-based surveillance system of India’s land and sea borders at a time the country is facing security concerns on the western border with Pakistan, northern border with China and increased sea surveillance by Chinese spy vessels and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region.The new fleet of satellites will be based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can “interact with each other in space to gather geo-intelligence” on the Earth. “We will have communication between satellites, so that if some satellite detects something, which is at GEO (geosynchronous equatorial orbit) at 36,000km altitude, it can ask another satellite in the lower orbit (at 400-600 km altitude) to check much more carefully and then give us more information. This capability will give us enormous potential,"" a senior Isro official said last December.The new tech will be able to “improve the ability of satellites to detect changes, to bring in more AI-related and data-driven approaches to analyse data, reduce data downloads and get only the necessary information”. “If India is able to launch satellites at this scale, threats to the country can be better mitigated,” he said. The recent Cabinet clearance to purchase 31 weaponised Predator drones from US-based General Atomics will add more teeth to the surveillance capability of the SBS-3 mission.Like the earlier dedicated satellites such as Gsat-7B (Indian Army), GSAT-7 (Rukmini for Navy) and GSAT-7A (Angry Bird for the IAF) for the armed forces, the three wings will have more such dedicated satellites for their special operations and missions.SBS operates 24-hours a day, 7-day a week collecting metric and space object identification data for man-made orbiting objects without the disruption of weather, time of day and atmosphere that can otherwise limit ground-based systems.","The Cabinet Committee on Security led by PM Narendra Modi has quietly approved the phase III of the Space Based Surveillance ( SBS-III ) for launching a big bunch of spy satellites.

The guidelines replace norms over a decade old and will prevent the elected govt from making backdoor or out-of-turn appointments, an official said.The updated regulations were outlined in a govt notification, bringing them into effect right away.The move follows complaints of dubious recruitments in state-owned entities such as J&K Bank, other bodies and govt departments by successive NC and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regimes earlier.In the aftermath of the Aug 2019 abrogation of J&K’s statehood and special status, powers of such recruitments were vested with LG Sinha.

The Boeing 737 (VT-AYB) had left Trichy at 5.43 pm as IX613 with about 150 people on board.“Since the aircraft was fuelled up to fly to Sharjah , a long flight, the crew burnt fuel for well over a hour by circling nearby before landing.This was done to avoid over weight landing by coming below the maximum landing weight. An over weight landing can damage the landing gear,” said sources. It landed safely around 8.15 pm in Trichy after safely burning fuel.The pilots’ action is being commended. “While we are all trained for such situations in simulators, doing what is required when actually the time comes by keeping presence of mind is key.

We would like to clarify that no emergency was declared by the operating crew. After reporting a technical snag, the aircraft circled multiple times in the designated area as an abundant precaution, to reduce fuel and weight considering the runway length, before making a safe precautionary landing. The cause of the snag will be duly investigated. In the interim, an alternative aircraft is being arranged for the onward journey of our guests. We regret the inconvenience and reiterate our commitment to prioritising safety in every aspect of our operations.”Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said on X: “I am heartened to hear that the AI Express flight has landed safely.

'Cautiously optimistic' about LAC talks with China: Defence minister Rajnath Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cautiously-optimistic-about-lac-talks-with-china-defence-minister-rajnath-singh/articleshow/114158450.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the ongoing diplomatic-military talks with China to peacefully resolve the troop confrontation in eastern Ladakh , defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday, while at the same time expressing full confidence in the Army to tackle any contingency if things go south along the frontier.""Our optimism"" about the talks with China is ""dependent"" on ""actual progress"" being made on the ground in terms of troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh, Singh said, addressing the Army commanders' conference at Gangtok.India has been pushing China for the sequential process of first disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok, followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of its 50,000 forward deployed troops along the line of actual control (LAC) there.Singh's statement came against the backdrop of China's propensity for double-speak, with there often being a yawning gap between what it says and what it does on the ground, ever since the People's Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.Singh was slated to attend the Army commanders' conference chaired by General Upendra Dwivedi at Gangtok but addressed it through videoconferencing from Sukna in Darjeeling due to bad weather.The conference being held near the China border for the first time was itself a message to China, which has raised the stakes in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) of LAC as well by deploying another 90,000 soldiers there.Gen Dwivedi himself had struck a note of caution earlier this month, stressing that ""trust has become the biggest casualty"" with China, with the situation being ""stable but sensitive and not normal"" along the LAC.While ""positive signaling"" has come out from the flurry of political-diplomatic meetings over the last two months, the execution of any plan will depend on military commanders on the ground, he said.Consequently, even as the Army will maintain its soldiers in forward locations for the fifth successive winter in the forbidding terrain of eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh-Sikkim, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is also working hard to narrow the huge border infrastructure differential with China.At a ceremony in Sikkim on Saturday, Singh will inaugurate 22 roads, 51 bridges and two other projects constructed by the BRO for Rs 2,236 crore. Among the projects, 19 are in J&K, 18 in Arunachal Pradesh, 11 in Ladakh, 9 in Uttarakhand and 6 in Sikkim.Singh on Friday also said the armed forces must be prepared for ""asymmetric warfare"", which has been brought home by ongoing conflicts in the present ""complex and ambiguous world situation"".""Unconventional and asymmetric warfare, including hybrid war, will be part of future conventional wars. This necessitates that armed forces should keep all these facets in consideration while formulating strategies. Be alert, regularly modernise and prepare continuously for various contingencies,"" Singh said.","India has been pushing China for the sequential process of first disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok.

He also urged Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to withdraw support to BJP-led NDA at Centre.""Nitish himself is a product of his (JP's) movement.

Fortified-food plan faces questions from two PM panel members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fortified-food-plan-faces-questions-from-two-pm-panel-members/articleshow/114158711.cms,"Government is pushing ahead with the rice fortification scheme, which will cost over Rs 17,000 crore, but two members of PM's economic advisory council (EAC-PM) have written articles or papers citing consumption survey data to argue that fortification may not be the best way to tackle anaemia among women and children. This is in line with what several public health experts have been saying.Sanjeev Sanyal, an EAC-PM member and former principal economic advisor to the finance minister, wrote an article just a fortnight back questioning the wisdom of large-scale food fortification. He cautioned that ""an important driver of fortification-heavy strategy is advocacy by international donors and NGOs"" and suggested that ""much stronger evidence supporting different kinds of fortification"" was needed.Shamika Ravi, another EAC-PM member, was one of the authors of a paper published by EAC that analysed the latest household consumption survey data and showed that prevalence of anaemia among children and women was associated with poor dietary diversity of iron sources. The analysis flagged ""the limited impact"" of universal fortification of cereals to improve iron and zinc intake and reduce anaemia in India. The analysis based on survey data for 2022-23 and 2011-12 was done by Ravi and several experts from Indian Statistical Institute.Sanyal questioned whether fortification was an efficient response to undernutrition with thousands of crores of public money being spent on fortification for the universal distribution of fortified rice through PDS, midday meals and Integrated Child Development Scheme. He pointed out that of 18 studies on the impact of rice fortification on anaemia, which was used as scientific evidence by central govt to justify ramping up rice fortification programmes, only four were from India and that the results were ambiguous.According to Sanyal, even international donor community might be having second thoughts about fortification as Bill Gates also had recently stated that it is very important to diversify the diet. However, Sanyal concluded by stating that they were not advocating a blanket withdrawal of fortification but merely pointing out that much stronger evidence supporting different kinds of fortification was needed.","Government is pushing ahead with the rice fortification scheme, which will cost over Rs 17,000 crore.

The cabinet meet was supposed to start at 11 am but it started late. I had to take a flight to reach Nanded and then take a chopper to Ahmadpur to attend a farmers’ meeting.

NEW DELHI:: As if responding to the oft-thrown jibe at judges - ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" - CJI D Y Chandrachud said judges, though neither elected nor accountable directly to the people like the political executive, are bound by the constitutional mandate to ensure equitable distribution of resources and protection of individuals' rights.The ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" jibe was repeatedly thrown at SC when it quashed the irregular allocations of 2G spectrum and coal blocks by UPA govt, and also when it struck down the NJAC enacted by NDA govt.Delivering the Jigme Singye Wangchuk lecture at Thimphu in Bhutan on Thursday, the CJI said the essence of the public trust doctrine is that parliamentarians, judges, and govts hold constitutional authority only as representatives and trustees of the people.He said while the political executive, directly elected by the people, is the sole authority to decide how natural resources and other tangible and intangible resources are distributed among the people, it is the judiciary which is vested with the responsibility to ensure that the distribution is equitable and not as per the whims and fancies of certain individuals.""We are not elected representatives. Public trust applies to us differently from other wings of govt,"" the CJI said, adding that judges are peculiarly placed in the doctrine of public trust linked with accountability as accountability is typically associated with elected representatives in democratic theory.Unlike the case of elected representatives, people do not have a role to play in the appointment of judges or influencing their decisions, he said. ""Populist decision-making sits rather uncomfortably on the sinewy shoulders of judicial independence . Yet the courts do require public trust and legitimacy.""""Public trust is central to the credibility of the judicial branch, which is otherwise insulated from public opinion in its operations - as it must be. Yet our insulation, which is intrinsic to our independence, provides a crucial need and justification for ensuring public trust in our functioning,"" he said.","The ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" jibe was repeatedly thrown at SC when it quashed the irregular allocations of 2G spectrum and coal blocks by UPA govt.
