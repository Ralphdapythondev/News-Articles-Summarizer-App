BJP on guard as wounded Baghel eyes redemption in Rajnandgaon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-on-guard-as-wounded-baghel-eyes-redemption-in-rajnandgaon/articleshow/109609074.cms,"RAIPUR: Rajnandgaon is superheated these days, and it’s not just because of the sweltering 40-degree summer heat. LS polls have rarely been this exciting here in the past 25 years.Since 1999, when Raman Singh — who would become CM for three terms — won this seat, the saffron flag has flown high and largely unchallenged in Rajnandgaon, save for a lone Congress bypoll victory in 2007.This time, though, BJP faces a fight. With former Congress CM Bhupesh Baghel stepping into the fray, the contest has reached a fever pitch. This is the bout to look out for in Chhattisgarh when three of its 11 LS seats go to polls on Friday.Baghel is seeking redemption — not only for himself, but also for the political losses suffered by Congress following the party’s shocking defeat in assembly polls a few months ago.BJP has fielded sitting MP Santosh Pandey — first time the party has repeated a candidate here — and is now having to throw its full might into the battle. The party has rolled out its big guns for Pandey — Union home minister Amit Shah and UP CM Yogi Adityanath have campaigned here.BJP’s strategy is to relentlessly attack Baghel on the alleged corruption in the state under his chief ministership from 2018 to 2023, while evoking Ram Mandir sentiments. Shah reminded voters at a Rajnandgaon rally that Chhattisgarh is the maternal place of Ram, and it is PM Narendra Modi who not only ensured a temple was built in Ayodhya, but also consecrated the idol of Ram Lalla.Baghel, meanwhile, has shed his image of a streetfighter and is focusing on quiet door-to-door campaigns. He believes the people of Rajnandgaon are yearning for a change and will reward Congress for the welfare schemes he implemented as CM. “BJP has conned the public by discontinuing his welfare schemes like godhan yojana, unemployment allowance, and programmes launched for landless labourers, farmers, and women,” he says in his speeches.Recounting Congress’s defeat in the assembly polls, Baghel recently voiced his scepticism about EVMs, but he is careful not to be too loud in his campaigns. He holds streetcorner meetings and says Congress’s ‘Mahalaxmi Yojana’ is being talked about more than BJP’s Mahtari Vandan Yojana.“People understand me. They know I speak the truth.”Pandey has strong grassroots connection as he has been active in the region as an RSS worker, especially in Kawardha and Pandariya assembly segments. “From Chilphi to Aundhi, BJP workers are working day and night for the party. It’s not just about the candidate, it’s always more about the party,” he says, banking on Ram Mandir and “Modi magic”.“Chhattisgarh is Lord Ram’s maternal place and people are overjoyed with Modiji for the consecration of Ram Lalla at the Ayodhya temple. Most people in Chhattisgarh have ‘Ram’ in their names, and they are deeply connected to him. The janata of Rajnandgaon will show Congress the consequences of corruption,” the sitting MP says.Congress won five of the eight assembly seats in Rajnandgaon in the 2023 polls. BJP won Rajnandgaon (Raman Singh), Kawardha and Pandariya. This LS battle has all signs of a photo finish, but it remains to be seen if tradition prevails or history is made when the constituency’s 14 lakh electorate votes on Friday.",Three of Chhattisgarh's 11 LS seats go to polls on Friday. BJP has fielded sitting MP Santosh Pandey — first time the party has repeated a candidate here. BJP’s strategy is to relentlessly attack Baghel on the alleged corruption in the state.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109609070,imgsize-475698,width-400,resizemode-4/109609070.jpg"
"For Nitish, a lot at stake as 5 seats vote",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-nitish-a-lot-at-stake-as-5-seats-vote/articleshow/109608824.cms,"PATNA

:

With campaigning coming to an end for the second phase of

Lok Sabha elections

on Wednesday evening, a litmus test awaits

Bihar chief minister

Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) in five constituencies — Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Bhagalpur and Banka — where polling will be held on April 26.

From NDA, JD(U) has fielded its candidates on all the five seats — three in Muslim-dominated

Seemanchal region

and two in the eastern part of the state.

In an indication that plenty is at stake for him, the CM penned an emotional letter to voters on Tuesday, recounting the work he had done since 2005 to change the face of the state. In the 2019 elections, JD(U) had won four of the five constituencies, losing only Kishanganj to Congress.

Senior BJP leaders, including PM Modi, Union minister Rajnath Singh and party president J P Nadda, have campaigned in the region for JD(U) candidates. Since Seemanchal is a Muslim-dominated region, BJP took into account Nitish’s secular image and gave all the three seats to his party. The CM, in a marked departure from his style of campaigning, was seen holding roadshows in Bhagalpur on Tuesday.

From the opposition INDIA, Congress is contesting three — Kishanganj, Katihar and Bhagalpur — and RJD two seats — Purnia and Banka — in the second phase.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and party MP Rahul Gandhi have campaigned for the candidates, but the lead campaigner was former deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad, who criss-crossed the region to garner support for the nominees.

While Katihar, Bhagalpur and Banka are expected to see a direct fight between NDA and INDIA nominees, there will be triangular contests in Kishanganj and Purnia. While Pappu Yadav, whose repeated pleas to RJD to spare Purnia for him fell on deaf ears, has entered as an Independent, Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM has fielded Akhtarul Iman from Kishanganj.

JD(U)’s Mujahid Alam and Congress’s sitting MP Mohd Jawed are the other two contestants in Kishanganj. AIMIM’s entry is a setback for Congress as he might eat into Jawed’s vote bank. Nitish is banking on his secular image but many in the constituency have openly said that they would vote to dislodge BJP from the Centre, and Alam may have to face people’s ire. Kishanganj till now was considered a safe seat for Congress as despite the Modi wave, the party won in 2014 and 2019.

In Katihar, JD(U)’s Dulal Chandra Goswami is locked in a direct contest with Congress veteran and five-time MP Tariq Anwar. Senior BJP functionaries, including Amit Shah, campaigned for him. Though Goswami won in 2019 against Anwar by over 57,000 votes, overcoming antiincumbency would be a challenge.

In Purnia, where JD(U)’s Santosh Kushwaha — who won in 2014 and 2019 — is pitted against RJD’s Bima Bharti and Independent Pappu Yadav, people might vote for a change this time.

Five-time MP Pappu is a popular figure in Purnia and has represented the seat in Lok Sabha thrice. As far as RJD is concerned, Tejashwi’s personal appeals to the people of the state to support Bharti might work wonders for her.

In Bhagalpur, JD(U)’s Ajay Kumar Mandal will slug it out with Congress’s Ajit Sharma. Voters may elect Mandal again with the sole motive of bolstering Modi’s chances. However, many feel that Mandal went “missing” after winning in 2019.

Since Congress is contesting Bhagalpur after a gap of several years, taking on the might of NDA would be a challenge. In Banka, Girdhari Yadav of JD(U) and Jai Prakash Yadav of RJD are locked in a direct contest. Girdhari won in 2019 against the same opponent by over 2 lakh votes. But Jai Prakash should not be underestimated as he won the seat in 2014 despite the Modi wave.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has fielded its candidates on all the five seats. Congress is contesting three seats and RJD two seats in the second phase of elections. Polling will be held on April 26.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109608818,imgsize-440614,width-400,resizemode-4/109608818.jpg"
BJP faces key test as Assam’s migrant Muslim majority seats go to polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-faces-key-test-as-assams-migrant-muslim-majority-seats-go-to-polls/articleshow/109608511.cms,"GUWAHATI: After the initial confidence of a win in Assam’s five indigenous-heavy LS seats that voted in phase 1, BJP now faces a challenge in the state’s remaining nine constituencies, as in eight of them, the significant Bangladesh-origin Muslim migrant voters play a crucial role. The only exception is the tribal-reserved Diphu.Darrang-Udalguri, Diphu, Karimganj, Silchar and Nagaon vote on Friday while Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Barpeta and Guwahati on May 7.Once a Congress stronghold , these regions of Assam over the years became AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal’s backyard, but BJP is not shying away from efforts to stage an electoral coup in this migrant heartland. BJP’s lead crusader in Assam, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma , who has been extensively campaigning in these areas, says, “Times have changed. In the last 10 years, the mindset of people (Bangladesh-origin Muslims) has changed. These people have realised that BJP is not their enemy.”Sarma adds, “Think about it, neither the Emergency nor UPA’s corruption could sink Congress here. But this time, Congress will not be able to escape the Modi wave.”Since 2014, women voters have formed bulk of BJP’s support base. This time round, the party claims, Bangladesh-origin Muslim women too have joined in large numbers. “Peo ple know their vote can protect our minority sisters from the bane of polygamy and child marriage,” says Sarma.“Yesterday, I campaigned in Darrang-Udalguri and Nagaon. What caught my eye is that certain assembly segments which were historically presumed to be a no-go for BJP are ready to reject and eject Congress’s minority appeasement politics,” he wrote on X recently. “In 2021, when I came to campaign in Nagaon, some youths from the Muslim community welcomed me by pelting stones. Today, the same people are showering rose petals on me and welcoming me without doing vote-bank politics.”In Nagaon, the Bangladeshorigin Muslim voters account for over 51% of the electorate, and in Darrang-Udalguri, a newly carved seat post-delimitation last year, over 30%. Sarma’s rally in Lahoirghat under Nagaon constituency saw a massive turnout of Bangla desh-origin Muslim voters, compelling him to say, “Outside Assam, no one will believe that 50,000 Muslims went to a BJP election meeting.”On the other hand, in southern Assam’s Barak Valley, Karimganj’s Muslim population is more than 60%, followed by over 40% in Silchar.Barpeta, meanwhile, has seen an electoral demographic overhaul post the delimitation process. Once a Bangladeshorigin Muslim majority, the seat has seen Hindu population shoot up. BJP’s ally AGP is contesting this seat.Guwahati too has a sizeable Bangladesh-origin Muslim electorate of more than 25%.Among the four seats that vote in the third phase, Dhubri, where Ajmal is the sitting MP, has the highest concentration of Muslims — majority being Bangladesh-origin migrants — in the country. AGP is contesting this seat too and Sarma is expected to campaign here.Apart from the Bangladesh origin Muslim factor, Nagaon, Silchar and Karimganj have a large concentration of Bangladesh-origin Hindu migrants, who are covered by Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which gives BJP a key advantage. Sarma has been promising to resolve problems of citizenship faced by Bengali Hindus in the next six months.Locking horns with BJP are Congress, AIUDF and TMC— each having significant support bases among Muslim voters in the state. Nagaon, Karimganj and Dhubri seats are set for three-cornered contests between BJP, Congress and AIUDF, while in Silchar, BJP, Congress and TMC are fighting. In Darrang-Udalguri too, it is a three-way contest between BJP, Congress and BPF — which has AIUDF’s support, while in Guwahati, it is a straight fight between Congress and BJP. In Barpeta, it’s a AGP vs Congress vs CPM fight.Last week, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while campaigning for the party’s candidate in Silchar, took the middle path to woo both Hindus and Muslims as she projected that Bengalispeaking voters could be 70% of the state’s electorate if they rise over religious identities and form a linguistic unity. She attacked BJP for National Register of Citizens (NRC) and CAA, while assuring a solution to ‘D’ voters (doubtful voters), detention camps and NRC — issues nagging Bengalis in Assam for decades.","BJP faces a challenge in the state’s remaining nine constituencies, as in eight of them, the significant Bangladesh-origin Muslim migrant voters play a crucial role.

"In Maharashtra’s cotton county, it’s farm issues vs Hindutva",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-maharashtras-cotton-county-its-farm-issues-vs-hindutva/articleshow/109608088.cms,"The orange-cotton county of Vidarbha is a study in contrasts. Home to a bustling tier-2 town, which is a satellite urban centre to Nagpur, Amravati also has the spectre of malnutrition and crop failure hanging over it. Plus, the makings of a battle of prestige between BJP and Congress in the second phase of Lok Sabha polls.This is where one-time Tollywood actor and incumbent Independent MP Navneet Rana is facing a spirited opposition.The Mumbai-born Punjabi, who starred in Telugu films before marrying local politician Ravi Rana, is contesting on a BJP ticket this time. A Ravidassia caste certificate upheld by Supreme Court has put an end to a long-drawn legal battle over her eligibility to contest from a reserved SC seat.Of the six assembly segments here, one is represented by Navneet’s husband Ravi Rana as an Independent. Two others have MLAs of Prahar Janshakti Party (PJP), and the remaining three – including the tribal, forested area of Melghat – are with Congress. It’s a region where BJP has limited presence. Expanding its reach by riding piggyback on Rana’s popularity is part of the same strategy it has used across Maharashtra to bring on board allies.Navneet, who defeated a Shiv Sena veteran in the last Lok Sabha polls, has used the Hindutva card to effect so far. In 2022, amid reports of being in talks with BJP, she announced she would stand outside Uddhav Thackeray’s residence to chant ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. She ended up in judicial custody for obstructing a police team sent to arrest her.“Chanting Hanuman Chalisa is a matter of faith for me and has no connection to politics. I chose to chant it rather than indulge in caste politics,” she told TOI in an interview conducted on her campaign trail. Navneet says she has the “might of the BJP” behind her and the blessings of the leadership – “Importantly, PM Modi fully supports me.”Last December, the Ranas held a 10-day-long Shivapuran Katha Yagya on the outskirts of Amravati, with over 10 lakh participants. Amit Shah was the star campaigner in her constituency this week. Though she is buoyant about her prospects, the opposition – Sharad Pawar, Thackeray, Mukul Wasnik, Anil Deshmukh – has now rallied together for Congress candidate Balwant Wankhede.Modi may appeal to youth and women, but Wankhede is banking on the large MarathaOBC vote bank that has remained loyal to the party. The disquiet over the failed promises of a quota hangs in the air. Rahul Gandhi led the party’s last big rally on Wednesday.To complicate matters, there’s the PJP candidate seeking better pricing for farm produce, ample water supply and power at cheaper rates, and compensation for losses due to recent hailstorms and unseasonal showers. PJP chief Bachhu Kadu says the real fight in Amravati is between his candidate Dinesh Bub and Congressman Balwant Wankhede.In a tier-2 town built on agricultural wealth, issues such as poor warehousing, low penetration of irrigation, exclusion of farmers from loan waivers and crop insurance schemes, besides rising prices of fertilizers, clearly resonate the most with voters.Vaibhav Deshmukh, 38, from Belora village, who is a tur daal, soyabean, banana and watermelon grower, said due to warehousing con straints, traders and brokers were skimming off the profits, selling his produce at high prices in retail. Poor rates for oranges have forced Nitish Mokalkar, 31, from Shipgaon to take to cotton, gram and onion farming instead. He said growing 3-4 different crops was the only way to insulate himself from the vagaries of weather and market.Vijay Sonare, a 30-year-old orange orchard owner in Pimpri village, said hailstorms have damaged the latest crop. “Ideally, govt should pitch in with the insurance premium (Rs 7,500 per acre) that orange growers cannot afford. Irrecoverable loss can discourage the farmer from farming. However, there is not a word about this deplorable condition of farmers in the ongoing elections,” he said.","One-time Tollywood actor and incumbent Independent MP Navneet Rana is facing a spirited opposition.

How Mayawati is making poll battles tougher in western UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-mayawati-is-making-poll-battles-tougher-in-western-up/articleshow/109608079.cms,"Jaati hai ki jaati nahi hai (caste is such that it never goes away).” This quote by satirist Harishankar Parsai appears quite telling about the ongoing elections in Uttar Pradesh. BJP ’s social engineering in 2014 and 2019 elections in UP was based on consolidation of non-Yadav OBC and nonJatav SC voters with the party’s traditional vote-base. This time, in western UP , some of these affiliations are breaking.Jat votes seem to be splitting, a section of non-Jatav SCs appears to be returning to BSP, whose traditional Jatav votes look intact in several seats of the region. While it’s difficult to predict how these will impact the outcome, it seems that because of BSP some constituencies could have triangular fights.Despite lying low compared with others, Mayawati seems to be making battles tough for them. Her Jatav caste, a subcaste of Chamar, appears standing behind her in Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida), which BSP had won in 2009. “Although most Jatavs here will vote for BSP, this is probably the last time we’re supporting Behenji. If she doesn’t win a respectable number of seats, the votes might shift, maybe to (Bhim Army chief) Chandrashekhar Azad,” says Brahma Pradhan of Ramgarh village in Gautam Budh Nagar, who sports Azadstyle moustache. Rajendra Singh Solanki, BSP candidate from the seat is also getting a chunk of votes from his caste, Rajput, which had gone to BJP in 2014 and 2019. “Go to Ghodi Pachera village. Every Thakur house there has a BSP flag,” Pradhan added.However, in Bulandshahr, the Jatav vote seems to be splitting. “We won’t put our vote down the drain. On election eve, we will have a meeting and decide whom to vote to beat BJP,” said Ram Singh of Janipur Khurd village on Bulandshahr-Anupshahr road. “If a Congress candidate looks stronger, we will vote for Congress,” he added. This uncertainty was absent in Gahana Govardhanpur village. “All Jatavs are voting for Congress here,” said Gagan Kumar, who was riding a motorcycle with ‘Jai Bhim’ written on the back and a flag of Bhim Army in the front. “You tell us who we should vote for,” quipped Rama Devi from the same village. “Is it okay if I give my vote to ‘haath’ (hand)?” she laughed.“Jatavs moving away from BSP and Jatavs voting for Congress to defeat BJP are two different things,” said Brahma Pradhan. “Either you met a few disgruntled people or maybe it’s because of Congress. No Jatav will ever vote for SP for reasons we all know. After Behenji lost the mandate in 2012, the Gujjars in nearby villages made this place a living hell. Our women were disrespected and our cattle were stolen but police seldom took action,” he said. Deepak Kumar of the same village added, “Apart from that, the BSP candidate is stronger.”In Baghpat, Mayawati seems to be also gaining voters who had ditched her for BJP in 2014 and 2019. “Our Jatav subcaste became the most politically empowered among the scheduled castes and this disenfranchised others. We tried BJP in 2014 and 2019 but we are returning to BSP in this election,” said Bhavar Singh of Sanoli village in Baghpat, who retired from Delhi Transport Corporation. Devendra Singh of the same village had similar views. Asked why they had turned against BJP, Singh said the party is anti-Dalit and wants 400 seats to “change the Constitution”.Some others said BJP’s alliance with RLD, which is dominated by Jats, had also put off Dalits, who see Jats as “oppressors”. “How will they support those who didn’t let them vote for 50 years? If some of them vote for SP, it will only be to teach BJP a lesson,” said Anees, who was an AIMIM candidate from Chhaprauli in the assembly election. “In the 2019 election, Akhilesh and Mayawati were in alliance and Yadav (SP’s traditional voters) votes were transferred while Jatavs voted for BSP where the party was contesting and BJP where there was an SP candidate,” he added.Incidentally, while Jat votes could be splitting in some seats, in the belt between Bulandshahr and Chhaprauli the community appeared solidly united behind RLD. “Last time, Jats here had moved to the SP alliance. Wherever RLD goes, we will vote there. These votes are for RLD and not BJP and they have remained intact from the time of Chaudhary Charan Singh,” said Sardar Singh of Kurdi village. “However, our relatives are voting for SP’s Iqra Hasan in Kairana,” he said. “I am not happy with the government but like Bhishma Pitamah was tied to Hastinapur, Jats are tied to RLD in Baghpat,” he laughed.Sikandar Singh and Jai Prakash from Gahana Govardhanpur in Bulandshahr constituency said a section of Jats was voting for Congress this time because Agniveer and unemployment were big issues among the community.In this belt, BJP seems to have retained support of many castes that have swung towards the saffron party in recent years. “Some Lodhs might be voting for Congress but BJP has a bigger number of the community’s votes,” said Sunil Kumar, Lodh from Kuchheja village in Bulandshahr. Lodh or Lodhi is an agricultural community whose biggest leader was former UP CM Kalyan Singh. “Bulandshahr is a Lodh and Saini (Mali caste) stronghold. And both these castes are with BJP. Kalyan Singh has been an MP from here,” said Chandra Pal.","Jat votes seem to be splitting, a section of non-Jatav SCs appears to be returning to BSP. While it’s difficult to predict how these will impact the outcome, it seems that because of BSP some constituencies could have triangular fights. Mayawati seems to be gaining voters who had ditched her for BJP in 2014 and 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109608079,imgsize-44432,width-400,resizemode-4/109608079.jpg"

The Prime Minister linked Congress manifesto to Manmohan Singh's 2006 speech on minorities having the first right on nation's resources.The Congress chief claimed that he is neither shocked nor surprised by the language used by Prime Minister in his recent speeches. ""It was expected that you and other leaders from your party would start speaking in this manner after you saw the dismal performance of the BJP in the first phase of the elections,"" Kharge said in the letter.""Your 'suit-boot ki sarkar' works for the corporates whose taxes you reduced while the salaried class pays higher taxes.

I think you have still not forgotten your pre-Independence allies the Muslim League and colonial masters,"" he said.Kharge then unleashed a counteroffensive against the BJP and claimed the Congress has always served to empower the poor while ""you have ruled to snatch the earnings and wealth of the poor"".He said in the letter, ""Your government was the one who used demonetisation as an 'organised loot and legalised plunder' to transfer the money deposited by the poor in the banks to the rich in the form of loans. Then, as part a of conscious design, these loans were surreptitiously written off by your government. The lakhs of crores of corporate loans that your government has written off since 2014 is a transfer of wealth from poor to rich.

Rahul Gandhi

and

Akhilesh Yadav

, who have joined hands for

Lok Sabha elections

in Uttar Pradesh, describing them as flop pair of ""Do ladkon ki jodi.""

The Prime Minister, who did not take the names of the two, alleged that their friendship is based on ""politics of appeasement.""

""Can you expect development from flop pair of 'Do ladkon ki jodi',""

PM Modi

said at an election rally in Uttar Pradesh as he accused them of wanting to snatch the rights of the OBC through the back door.

""The friendship between the two boys in UP is based on politics of appeasement. Both talk of the OBC in their speeches but they want to snatch away their rights from the back door and strengthen their (own) vote bank,"" he alleged.

""The Congress government in Karnataka has overnight turned all the Muslim castes in Karnataka into OBCs by stamping a paper and told them to become the owners of this 27 per cent and loot it. They have robbed the rights of the OBCs. The Congress intends to play the same game in UP, to perform the same feat, wherever they get a chance in the country, they want to secretly rob the rights of the OBCs, SCs, and STs from the back door and give them away.

And in this, the Samajwadi Party is also fully supporting them,"" PM Modi said.

""SP and Congress want to snatch the rights that are granted to these communities by the Constitution and give it to their vote banks. For the vote bank, Samajwadi Party is betraying Yadavs and backward communities. Both Congress and SP are drenched in appeasement politics and have similar thinking. In speeches, they talk about OBC, but through the back door, want to give their rights to their vote banks,"" the Prime Minister said.

Prime Minister Modi renewed his 'Mangalsutra' attack and said under the rule of Akhilesh the 'mangalsutra' of our mothers and sisters were not safe as criminals would snatch them when they stepped out of their houses.

Rajiv Gandhi abolished inheritance tax to save his family's property: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajiv-gandhi-abolished-inheritance-tax-to-save-his-familys-property-pm-modi/articleshow/109593243.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

on Thursday stepped up his attack on Congress on 'wealth redistribution' issue and claimed that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi abolished

inheritance tax

to save his family's property.

Addressing an election rally in Morena, the Prime Minister alleged that the Congress has accumulated wealth over four generations and now seeks to ""loot"" the wealth of the people.

""The facts relating to Inheritance Tax are eye-opening. When former PM

Indira Gandhi

died, her children were going to get her property. But there was a rule earlier, that before the property goes to the children some part of it was taken by the government.

Congress had formulated a law on this. To save the property so that it does not go to the government, the then PM Rajiv Gandhi scrapped the inheritance law,"" PM

Modi

said.

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused PM Modi of spreading ""lies"" to divert attention from the real issues in the Lok Sabha polls. Ramesh challenged the Prime Minister to point out where in the Congress manifesto ""redistribution of wealth"" is mentioned, asserting that it is not part of the party's agenda.

He emphasized that the Congress will focus on issues of unemployment and price rise rather than engaging in the BJP's narrative.

Jairam Ramesh claimed that PM Modi ""symbolises Asatyamev Jayate'.

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters, Ramesh said the Congress will not play on the pitch prepared by the BJP but ""will play on the pitch of issues of unemployment and price rise"".

He asserted that there is no mention of inheritance tax in the Congress manifesto and it is not part of the party's agenda.

""Rajiv Gandhi had abolished it in 1985. However, BJP leaders such as Arun Jaitley and Jayant Sinha advocated in favour of inheritance tax. The one who says we will bring inheritance tax is wrong and in fact, it is the BJP's agenda,"" Ramesh said.

He also questioned PM Modi's claim that the Congress would redistribute wealth if it comes to power, challenging him to show where it is mentioned in their manifesto.

Pitroda had earlier expressed his support for the party's stance on wealth redistribution, drawing inspiration from the American system.

He explained that in the United States, when a wealthy individual passes away, only a portion of their assets can be transferred to their children, while the government claims a significant share. Pitroda suggested that adopting a similar approach in India would be fair and beneficial for the public.

Pitroda’s praise for US “grabbing” 55% of inheritan ces as “fair” served as ammo for Modi’s accusations that Congress was out to seize and redistribute wealth and assets.

Forced into damage control mode, Congress distanced itself from Pitroda’s comments and said it had no plan to introduce such a tax. “He (Pitroda) has expressed his views in the American context, which has no relevance for us. He does not speak on behalf of Congress,” party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said.","Narendra Modi steps up attack on Congress on 'wealth redistribution' issue.

Congress gave Muslims quota via backdoor in Karnataka: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-gave-muslims-quota-via-backdoor-in-karnataka-pm-modi/articleshow/109604031.cms,"BHOPAL: PM Modi on Thursday accused Congress of including Muslims as a whole in the OBC list in Karnataka “through the backdoor” and promoting reservation on religious lines in violation of the Constitution.He said when the Constitution was drafted, to protect the unity and integrity of the country, it was decided that there won’t be religion-based reservation.He said Congress’s decision to declare all Muslims in Karnataka as “backward”, on a par with OBCs, was inimical to the interests of backward classes.“Babasaheb Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, was against reservation on religious lines, but Congress… stabbed him in the back,” PM said. “Reservation to Muslims was unlawful. It’s an alarm bell for OBC communities of the entire country,” he said.Responding to Modi’s statement, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah wrote on X, “It’s true that in Karnataka, Muslims have been included in the 2B category for backward classes. This is not something done now. It has been based on the reports of Backward Classes Commissions. This reservation has been in place for the past three decades.“Neither the BJP govt previously in power in the state, nor the Narendra Modi-led Union govt that has been in power for the past 10 years has questioned this reservation. Moreover, no one, including BJP, has challenged it in court,” Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah wrote on X.He was reacting to a comment of PM Modi on reservation in Karnataka. “Overnight, all Muslims, regardless of wealth or social status, were turned into OBCs by the signing of a piece of paper. OBCs reservation rights were snatched clandestinely and illegally and given to Muslims. This was against the principles of Babasaheb Ambedkar,” PM said in Morena on his second day of electioneering in Madhya Pradesh.Meanwhile, National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) chairperson Hansraj Ahir took cognisance of the matter and summoned the Karnataka chief secretary for not submitting the report based on which Muslims were included in the OBC category on the grounds of religion.In Morena, Modi was relentless in his attack on Congress. “Congress wants to implement the Karnataka model in the entire country. Congress hatched a conspiracy against Scheduled Castes, tribals and backward classes. On Dec 19, 2011, during the Congress-led UPA regime, the Union govt brought a note in the cabinet meeting to cut into the 27% OBC reservation and make place for religion-based quota. Two days later, govt issued an order which was later quashed by Andhra Pradesh High Court. Congress went to Supreme Court but got no relief,” he said.“The Congress manifesto of 2014 talked about religion-based reservation in jobs and education and it is influenced by the Muslim League. They said they will make a law for this, if needed. OBCs, Dalits and tribals woke up. They realised their later generations would be ruined, so they voted Congress out and turned its ploys to dust. Still, they didn’t learn and are trying out new ploys. If Congress wins, it will snatch reservation rights of OBCs and hand it over to its favourite votebank,” he further said.Modi said at the time of independence, Congress accepted partition on religious lines. “Instead of cutting the shackles fastening the wrists of Ma Bharti, they chopped off her arms. They divided the country but are still not willing to rectify it. Congress feels this is the easiest path for benefits. Today, again, Congress is restless for the chair. And to get that chair, they are adopting various ploys. They want to deceive crores of people, destroy the future of the country by making religious appeasement a pawn,” he said.“BJP operates on the motto of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. During the Covid crisis, there was no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion when 80 crore needy people were given free rations. Have you ever heard a complaint that a Muslim brother living in the village got no rations? BJP govt has given 4 crore homes to the poor without any discrimination and reached tap water to 11 crore households. Every community should get these benefits equally,” he said.","PM Modi accused Congress of including Muslims as a whole in the OBC list in Karnataka “through the backdoor” and promoting reservation on religious lines. “Reservation to Muslims was unlawful.

Addressing an election rally in Sonepur, Shah urged people to oust Naveen’s BJD govt and help form the state’s first BJP govt for accelerated development.“Some people are studying the development of all states in the country.They had come to me. While asking about the country, I asked them about the situation in Odisha. They said the 20-odd years of Naveen babu’s govt are lost years in the state’s history. Odisha remains at the same place where it was 20 years ago,” Shah said.Asserting confidence in BJP’s prospects, Shah said the party would win at least 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state and get the majority in the assembly. Simultaneous LS and state polls will be held in Odisha in four phases from May 13 to June 1.Shah criticised BJD govt for allegedly misappropriating central schemes and failing to implement Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. “Govt here not only hindered the state’s progress but also allowed corrupt officials to distance Odisha from its linguistic and cultural heritage, while states with BJP-led govts were scaling new heights of development,” he said.Accusing Naveen of attempting to divert attention from important events, Shah indirectly referred to the inauguration of Shree Mandira Parikrama project in Odisha during the time of the Ram temple’s opening in Ayodhya. He promised to re-develop Puri along the lines of Kashi Viswanath temple in UP.In response to Shah’s remarks, BJD’s Berhampur candidate Bhrugu Baxipatra claimed that the Union minister tried to boost the morale of BJP workers who are anticipating defeat. Baxipatra, a recent defector from BJP, defended Naveen’s administration, citing Odisha’s achievements in various sectors such as disaster management, health, education, job creation, and farmer welfare. “Odisha is the only state to have doubled farmers’ income over the past decade, a feat no BJP-governed state has managed to accomplish,” he said.Shah’s swipe at Naveen marks the first instance of a top BJP politician openly criticising the CM following the breakdown of alliance talks between the two parties. BJP had carefully chosen Sonepur for Shah’s first rally, which is part of Balangir LS seat. Naveen will be contesting from Kantabanji, his second seat, which is part of Balangir LS segment.","Union home minister Amit Shah launched a scathing attack on Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik ’s governance.

EC sought their replies by Monday morning.Though the EC notice didn’t mention the names of PM Modi and Rahul, saying it has received representations alleging violation of poll code by “some of the star campaigners” in speeches made during poll campaigns, complaints against them have been attached with the notices sent to BJP president J P Nadda and his Congress counterpart Mallikarjun Kharge.While Congress has complained against the PM, BJP has lodged a complaint against Rahul seeking action.Congress had complained against Modi’s speech at Rajasthan’s Banswara over the weekend, in which he said the opposition party plans to “redistribute wealth to infiltrators” and made a reference to Muslims. It had also complained about Modi referring to the Congress manifesto as one with “Muslim League imprint” and alleging that the party plans to divide the country should it win the elections. Congress listed five instances of MCC violations.In its complaint against Rahul filed last week, BJP alleged that Congress had made “derisive and obnoxious” utterances against the PM. Besides, it had also cited instances of Rahul’s speech in Kottayam (Kerala), in which he said, “... how can you tell the people of Tamil Nadu not to speak Tamil (and) the people of Kerala not to speak Malayalam... BJP does this with language, place, caste, and religion... whenever they get an opportunity, they divide the country...”The EC notices and orders available on its websites show that on two earlier occasions — in separate cases involving Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate and party MP Randeep Singh Surjewala — the Commission had informed Kharge of action ordered against the duo while asking the party to take steps for “strict compliance of” its advisories. Sources said the same approach was followed in case of transgressions by BJP’s Dilip Ghosh, with the poll body informing Nadda of the action ordered against his colleague.The notices issued to Nadda and Karge on Thursday are on different footing in that the EC has not taken any action yet against Modi and Rahul.The EC notices to BJP and Congress presidents have been issued as per Section 77 of the Representation of People Act, which allows parties to name “star campaigners”. It said, “...the Commission is of the considered view that political parties will have to take primary and increasing responsibility for the conduct of their candidates in general and star campaigners, in particular.” The EC also said campaign speeches by those holding “high positions are of more serious consequence”.While mentioning that parties have the power to nominate/withdraw ‘star campaigner’ status of their leaders as well as the authority to control them, the EC said, “The Commission has taken a view that while a star campaigner would continue to remain responsible for speeches made, the Commission will address party president/head of political party, on a case-to-case basis.”The two-page notice also said that star campaigners are expected to contribute to a higher quality of discourse by way of providing an all-India perspective which sometimes gets distorted in the heat of the contests at the local level. The EC said it is of the “considered view that parties will have to take primary and increasing responsibility for the conduct of their candidates in general, and star campaigners in particular”.","Election Commission issued notices to the chiefs of BJP and Congress seeking their response to alleged violations made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

If one bomb is thrown at us, then 10 cannons should be fired at them.""""These days, Congress 'shehzada' is having fun humiliating Modi...

With folded hands, Modi added, ""My request to everyone is to kindly not be sad or angry. You know that they are 'naamdar' while I am 'kaamdar'.

The party amassed 56.9 percent of the overall votes, with the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trailing behind in second and third place, respectively.On March 16, 2023, chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced that a staggering 96.8 crore voters are poised to exercise their voting rights in the forthcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. With 10.5 lakh polling stations and 1.5 crore polling officials and security personnel already in place, preparations are well underway for the colossal electoral process in the world's largest democracy.","The Election Commission of India announced the voting and result declaration schedules for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections on Saturday.

The new polling hours in Banka and three other constituencies – Madhepura, Khagaria, and Munger – will be from 7 am to 6 pm.From the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), JD(U) has fielded its candidates on all the five seats in the second phase . From the opposition camp, Congress is contesting three, and RJD two seats. Congress has fielded its candidates in Kishanganj, Katihar, and Bhagalpur constituencies, and the RJD nominees are in the fray in Purnia and Banka.While Katihar, Bhagalpur, and Banka are expected to see a direct fight between NDA and INDIA nominees, there will be triangular contests in Kishanganj and Purnia. Pappu Yadav entered the poll arena as an Independent after his repeated pleas to RJD to spare the Purnia seat for him fell on deaf ears. Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM has fielded Akhtarul Iman from Kishanganj.In Kishanganj, JD(U)’s Mujahid Alam is pitted against Congress’s sitting MP Mohd Jawed. AIMIM’s Akhtarul Iman has made the contest triangular in Kishanganj. Iman’s entry is a setback for RJD as he might eat into the vote bank of Jawed. Though Kishanganj is a Muslim-dominated constituency and Alam is an NDA face, Nitish’s secular image is a USP for him. However, since many in the constituency have openly said they would vote to dislodge BJP from power at the Centre, Alam may have to face people’s ire. On the other hand, Kishanganj is considered a safe seat for Congress. Despite the Modi wave, the party won the seat in 2014 and 2019.In Katihar, JD(U)’s Dulal Chandra Goswami is locked in a direct contest with Congress veteran and five-time MP Tariq Anwar. Senior BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, addressed rallies to seek support for Goswami. However, for Goswami, who won the 2019 elections against Anwar by over 57,000 votes, overcoming the anti-incumbency factor would be a challenge.In Purnia, JD(U)’s Santosh Kushwaha, RJD’s Bima Bharti, and Independent candidate Pappu Yadav are locked in a triangular contest. Though Kushwaha won the Purnia seat twice, in 2014 and 2019, riding on the Modi wave, people might vote for a change this time. Five-time MP Pappu is a popular figure in Purnia. He represented the seat in Lok Sabha thrice. Pappu had merged his Jan Adhikar Party with Congress with the hope to contest from Purnia. However, RJD did not spare the seat for Congress. It won’t be a surprise if Pappu pulls off a heist in the seat of his choice. As far as RJD is concerned, Tejashwi’s personal appeals to the people to support Bharti might work wonders for her.In Bhagalpur, JD(U)’s Ajay Kumar Mandal will slug it out with Congress’s Ajit Sharma. Voters in the constituency might root for Mandal once again with the sole motive of bolstering the chances of Narendra Modi to become the Prime Minister of the country for the third time. However, many in the constituency rue that Mandal went “missing” after winning the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.Since Congress is contesting the Bhagalpur seat after a gap of several years, taking on the might of NDA would be a challenge for Sharma.In Banka, Girdhari Yadav of JD(U) and Jai Prakash Yadav of RJD are locked in a direct contest. Girdhari won the 2019 elections against Jai Prakash by over two lakh votes. However, one should not underestimate the fact that Jai Prakash had won the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 from Banka on an RJD ticket despite the popular Modi wave.","Polling started at 7 am in Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Bhagalpur, and Banka.
