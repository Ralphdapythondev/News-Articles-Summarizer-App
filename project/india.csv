DOSA a dish with a past,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dosa-a-dish-with-a-past/articleshow/110066329.cms,"One of the earliest Tamil references to the word ‘dosa’ can be found in the eighth century dictionary, the Nigandus. The Nigandu ‘Chentham Diwakaram’ categorises dosa under the pancake-like ‘appam’ variety, while the 10th-century ‘Pingala Nigandu’ makes a mention of ‘kanjam’ as another name for dosa. Apart from the Nigandus, the 18th century ‘Virali vidu thoothu’ is an early Tamil work that mentions dosa.Clearly, the dish, a staple, in most homes in Tamil Nadu, has a history that steers back to kitchens hundreds of years ago.When a recent talk show on a private Tamil channel delved into the emotional connection Tamil Nadu has with this crispy delight that graces breakfast tables along with its fluffier more illustrious cousin, the idli, it brought up questions on the origins of the culinary staple. Clues to this lie not just within the annals of Tamil literature but in the halls of temples across the state. In Vishnu temples, food offerings to deities are referred to as ‘amudhu’ and here, dosa appears to take pride of place. There are numerous inscriptions dating to the 16th century that make references to the word ‘dosa’.Inscriptions at Vishnu temples in Tirupathi, Srirangam, and Kanchipuram mention that the service of donating money for the dosa offering was prevalent at the time and called ‘dosapadi’. One of them, at the Kancheepuram Varadaraja Pe rumal temple (1524AD) details a donation given for dosa by the famous Vijayanagar King Krishnadevarayar.It says that he had donated 3,000 panam for the dosapadi service. Land was purchased with this amount and 15 dosa offerings were made to the deity every day. In the same temple, an inscription dating to the reign of Vijayanagar king Achutaraya mentions a dosa offering made during the celebrations of the birth of lord Krishna. It’s unusual as dosa is not identified as among the sacred dishes made for Krishna Jayanthi celebrations today. Seventeenth-century inscriptions at the Parthasarathy temple in Chennai also mention dosa offerings for important temple festivals as do Ramanathapuram copper plates be longing to the same era. This would mean that by the 16th century, the dosa offering had become common in famous Perumal temples of the Tamilspeaking region.Even today, the dosa offering is special in famous Vishnu temples such as Azhagar Kovil, Singaperumal Kovil and Varadharaja Perumal Kovil. Most temple inscriptions mention the ingredient measurements given to make the dosa offering.For example, a Tamil inscription in Tirupathi details the measurements for the offering as three marakkal (around three kilos) of rice, one marakkal and three nazhi (nearly one and a half kilos) of black gram, one nalli and one uri (around two litres) of ghee. Some inscriptions even give recipes for different dosas. A Tirupathi temple mentions that sprinkled on top of the dosa offering. Everyone knows that dosa is prepared with rice and urad dal batter, but few inscripKanchipuram mention a spicy dosa with cumin and pepper added to the batter. Tamil cookbooks of the 19th century such as ‘Nalaveemma bagasasthiram’ also mention the same spicy dosa with cumin and pepper. The cookbook in fact has recipes for every kind of dosa from the spicy one with red chili, fried urad dal and asafoetida to sweet dosa with sugar. ‘Hindu bagasasthiram’, another old cookbook, lists recipes for a variety of dosas such as thengai dosa (coconut), vendhaya dosa (fenugreek), vengaya (onion), vella (white), kodumai maavu dosa (wheat flour), paal dosa (milk), pirandai dosa (made with a traditional herb) and paayatham paruppu dosa.The 2,000-year-old Sangam work ‘Madurai kaanji’ describes a food named ‘adai’ (similar to dosa but a different batter) sold on the streets of Madurai. Fast forward to present day, and the dosa culture shows no signs of waning. A recent report from food delivery service platform Swiggy says 29 million dosas were served up in the past year alone.In March, MTR Foods created a Guinness World Record for the lengthiest dosa at 123ft, the effort of 75 chefs and overcoming 110 previous unsuccessful attempts. It’s nothing new when you think about it as an inscription in Tirupathi, dating to the 16th-century, mentions the ‘pattanam dosa’, a big dosa, which was made in those days. So, the next time you make or order a crispy dosa, large or small, or even read about a batter record, remember, you’re savouring centuries of Tamil culinary legacy.(The writer is a researcher of Tamil culture)","The dish, a staple, in most homes in Tamil Nadu, has a history that steers back to kitchens hundreds of years ago.

How a unique hockey fest gave Coorg Guinness fame,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-a-unique-hockey-fest-gave-coorg-guinness-fame/articleshow/110066319.cms,"The lush hills of Kodagu (or Coorg , as most tourists still call it) are known for their coffee and cuisine. Much like the aroma of coffee or the traditional pandi (pork) curry that greets you in most households of this plantation region, you’ll probably find a hockey stick in every home.For the people of this region, hockey is not just a sport; it is a tradition or rather a legacy that has been passed down generations.While it is home to many gold-winning Olympians and international stars, the tradition of hockey is best summed up by the annual Kodava Hockey Festival — a summertime celebration of the sport that recently made it to the Guinness World Records as the largest field hockey tournament . What makes it truly unique is that every team comprises members of a single family — age and gender no bar.The annual event was started by Pandanda Kuttappa and his brother Kashi Ponnappa in 1997. Inspired by the 1982 Asian Games, Kuttappa wanted to put together a tournament that would keep hockey alive in its heartland. He also saw it as a way of bringing families together. It began with 62 participating families and was conducted on a budget of Rs 20,000. By 2003, the month-long tournament entered the Limca book of records.This year, the tournament, hosted by the Kundyolanda family which concluded a couple of weeks ago, witnessed a record 360 teams and 4,834 players. The budget exceeded Rs 2 crore.“Our family bid to host the tournament in 2017, and we were allotted the 2024 edition,” says Dinesh Cariappa, convener of the recently concluded carnival. “It takes a family about 4-5 years to make preparations for the tournament, so hosts have been finalised until 2028.” On being recognised by Guinness World Records, Cariappa says, “The certification on April 28 is a reflection of our rich sporting culture.”The players range from an Olympian to NRIs and kindergarten children. The oldest participant this year was 91-year-old Annadiyanda Chittiappa, while the youngest was a fiveyear-old — chin high to a hockey stick. Chittiappa speaks of the tournament with child-like enthusiasm. “We are a land of warriors and hockey is in our blood. I’ve played hockey from the time I can remember. When my daughter suggested that I should participate this year, I said why not? It made me feel younger.” The inter-clan contest is restricted to the Kodava community. A mixed gender competition, the women have a choice of playing either for their parental family or the family they are married into.Kodavas employed around the globe take time off to participate. Arun Achandira, a 46-year-old, calls Melbourne home but his heart is still in Kodagu. This year, he made his debut. “Every Kodava wants to play hockey. I didn’t get to play when I was in India as my family couldn’t put a team together and I’ve been living in Australia for 20 years now.”His 14-year-old son’s interest in the event spurred Achandira to take a month’s break and participate. “Four years ago, I introduced my older son Prince Bopanna to hockey at a local club and told him how it is an integral part of our culture,” says Achandira. “He wanted to play this year but couldn’t make it due to the academic cycle. So, my participation was to fulfil my long-cherished dream and that of my son as well. At 46, I played my first tournament!” The tournament has evolved over the years with corporate and govt funding. It is now a carnival with everything from cooking competitions to musical nights and marathons. There is even a match-making event.“The main objective is to maintain unity within the community,” says Pandanda Bopanna, president, Kodava Hockey Academy and son of Kuttappa, founder of the tournament. “We want to ensure people come back to their roots and play in front of their people. This year, 35 national and international players turned up for the tournament and an equal number of Kodavas in the armed forces took leave to play for their families.”The pride with which players take the field is palpable. Nikkin Thimmaiah, whose family Chendanda emerged champions, says it is the reason he started playing hockey. “I was inspired by watching my father play. Much before I dreamt of playing for the country, I wanted to play in the tournament and when I first played more than a decade ago, I was ecstatic,” says the 2016 Rio Olympian. Although there has been a decline in the number of Kodavas turning out for the national team lately, the tournament offers hope as the culture of hockey resides in the hearts and souls of Kodavas.","The Kodava Hockey Festival is the largest field hockey tournament in the world. The annual event was started by Pandanda Kuttappa and his brother Kashi Ponnappa in 1997. This year, the tournament, hosted by the Kundyolanda family, witnessed a record 360 teams and 4,834 players.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110066324,imgsize-4868,width-400,resizemode-4/110066324.jpg"

The 2.3-minute video emerged ahead of the scheduled hearing for Revanna’s bail petition. In the footage, the woman purportedly explains she left home due to societal pressure and negative rumours circulating after videos of her went viral. Her purported denial in the clip cast doubt on SIT ’s assertion that she was rescued from a farmhouse belonging to Revanna’s aide Sathish Babu, who has been arrested too.CM Siddaramaiah, meanwhile, ruled out handing over the case to CBI, turning down BJP’s demand for a central probe. He defended the SIT saying the team was doing its job properly and that BJP and JD(S) were misleading people by making such demands.","HD Revanna was arrested for the alleged kidnapping of a 47-year-old woman from Holenarsipura town.

49 seats, including all 13 in Uttar Pradesh, 9 out of 11 in Maharashtra, all 8 in Madhya Pradesh, all 5 in Bihar, 4 out of 17 in Telangana, 3 out of 4 in Jharkhand, 3 out of 8 in West Bengal, 3 out of 25 in Andhra Pradesh and 1 out of 4 in Odisha.Andhra, where TDP-BJP-JSP alliance would hope to do signiﬁcantly better than the 3 seats TDP won last time, and Telangana, where the decline of BRS creates space for BJP to become the main opposition.11 seats, including 5 out of 8 in West Bengal, 3 out of 17 in Telangana, 1 out of 4 in Jharkhand, 1 out of 4 in Odisha and 1 out of 11 in Maharashtra.Maharashtra, where the shifting alliances have created a new political dynamic; Telangana, where Congress won assembly polls just months back; and Bihar where it has nothing to lose and everything to gain.: This phase has a signiﬁcant presence of parties not aligned to other fronts. Unaligned parties won 35 of these seats last time. That includes the 22 seats won by YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh, 9 won by BRS in Telangana, 2 won by BJD in Odisha and 2 by AIMIM, one each in Telangana and Maharashtra.The lone seat in Jammu & Kashmir polling today, which is not possible to categorise as having been won by any party last time since seat boundaries have been redrawn since 2019.: All eyes will be on BJP and whether it betters its 2019 tally of 4 seats. The party has run a campaign led by the PM and sees Telangana as a possible second base in the south after Karnataka. The collapse of BRS has left a void, which BJP is keen to ﬁll. Buoyed by its assembly polls win, Congress has run an energetic campaign led by CM Revanth Reddy, who has tried to blunt the Modi factor by saying BJP intends to change the Constitution and remove SC/ST/OBC quota. Revanth also needs a handsome return from the state’s 17 seats to cement his own position.It’s one state, two polls here today, with bigger political focus on the assembly vote, as a close contest brews between Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP and Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP, which is in alliance with BJP and Telugu ﬁlm star Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena. The state has 25 LS seats and 175 assembly seats. In 2019, YSRCP demolished TDP, which was ﬁghting on its own, winning 151 assembly and 22 LS seats. This time, the alliance could be a deciding factor in many seats, especially if the Kapu community, to which Kalyan belongs, backs it.For three of India’s most politically signiﬁcant states, this is a phase that will play a deciding role in which way the pendulum swings come June 4. Each has its share of prestige ﬁghts for tall regional players who are INDIA bloc allies – Akhilesh Yadav in Samajwadi bastions in UP, Sharad Pawar in Marathwada, and Mamata Banerjee in her Bengal strongholds.BJP (Subrat Pathak)Akhilesh Yadav (SP), Subrat Pathak (BJP), Imran bin Jafar (BSP)This is a battle as personal as it is political for Akhilesh Yadav, in a constituency that was a family stronghold for 20 years till BJP wrested it in 2019. Kannauj is where Akhilesh ﬁrst stepped into the electoral arena in 2000, winning a bypoll after it was vacated by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had won the 1999 LS poll from two places and retained Mainpuri. Akhilesh went on to win two more terms from here before vacating it for his wife Dimple in 2012 when he became CM. This time, nephew Tej Pratap was initially ﬁelded from here, but the Samajwadi Party boss decided to return to the place he has deep bonds with to tame the feisty Subrat Pathak, a Brahmin, who defeated Dimple in 2019 and has likened the current contest to an “India-Pakistan cricket match”.Cong (Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury)Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (Cong), Yusuf Pathan (TMC), Nirmal Kumar Saha (BJP)In a seat he has turned into a synonym, winning it ﬁve times, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury perhaps faces his toughest challenge. The opponent he must be worried about is not a seasoned politician, but debutant Yusuf Pathan, the cricketer known for hitting towering sixes. In a constituency with 51% Muslim voters, Pathan is the ﬁrst heavyweight rival Chowdhury is facing who is Muslim. There’s a touch of irony as well because TMC, which is plotting to take him down, is an INDIA bloc partner nationally. Local doctor Nirmal Kumar Saha, for whom Yogi Adityanath has campaigned, will, meanwhile, hope to beneﬁt from a possible split in the Muslim vote.BJP (Giriraj Singh)Giriraj Singh (BJP) and Awadhesh Kumar Rai (CPI)A former Congress bastion that NDA has converted into a stronghold since JDU’s win in 2004, Union minister Giriraj Singh is aiming for a second straight term from here. The outspoken Singh defeated CPI’s Kanhaiya Kumar in 2019 in a contest that was followed nationally because of the ﬁery exchanges between the two. This time, the contest isn’t a triangular one like last time and Giriraj, a Bhumihar, faces one principal opponent in Grand Alliance candidate and three-time MLA Awadhesh Kumar Rai (CPI), which changes equations. The seat, located in central Bihar and famous as birthplace of poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, has a signiﬁcant Bhumihar vote.: YSRCP (YS Avinash Reddy)YS Avinash Reddy (YSRCP), YS Sharmila Reddy (Cong), Chadipiralla Bhupesh Subbarami Reddy (TDP)Andhra Pradesh Congress chief YS Sharmila takes on her cousin YS Avinash Reddy, the faceoff escalating the feud in the YSR family. Sharmila merged her YSR Telangana party into Congress and was subsequently appointed Andhra Congress chief. In recent months, she has been vocal against CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who is her elder brother. With Sharmila as its face, Congress is looking to upstage YSRCP here, the pieces now very differently arranged from the 2019 contest when Sharmila had extended her full support to YSRCP. Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP has a traditional vote bank in the constituency, making it an absorbing triangular ﬁght.: TMC (Mahua Moitra)Mahua Moitra (TMC), Amrita Roy (BJP), SM Saadi (CPM)The feud between BJP and TMC in the ‘cash-for-query’ row over which Mahua Moitra was expelled from Parliament in the backdrop, this is a ﬁery match between the two parties with CPM (INDIA bloc) in the third corner. BJP has ﬁelded ‘Ranima’ Amrita Roy, a descendant of Maharaja Krishnachandra Roy, after whom Krishnanagar is named. Mahua’s expulsion has given TMC a rallying point while the Roy family, known to everyone here, is out on the streets canvassing for ‘Ranima’. TMC has gone back to history to target the family, turning Krishnachandra ‘conniving with Robert Clive’ in the Battle of Plassey into campaign discourse. Krishnanagar has a strong BJP base but TMC holds six of the seven assembly segments.: AIMIM (Asaduddin Owaisi)Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), K Madhavi Latha (BJP)An AIMIM fortress, the Asaduddin Owaisi-led party has not lost this seat for 40 years. Though Congress and BRS have been ﬁelding candidates from here, Hyderabad had largely been a friendly ﬁght with parties in ofﬁce taking direct or indirect support of AIMIM to get Muslim votes in other constituencies of the state. Like in recent elections, the main contest is between Owaisi and BJP. Leading the saffron challenge is debutant Kompella Madhavi Latha. While BJP has talked up her chances, AIMIM has set a target of bettering Owaisi’s 2019 victory margin of 2.8 lakh votes.: BJP (Arjun Munda)Arjun Munda (BJP) and Kalicharan Munda (Cong)Arjun Munda scraped through last time by a margin of 1,445 votes. This time, the contest is tougher in this Jharkhand constituency where the 2017-18 Pathalgarhi movement, asserting tribal governance and implementation of the ﬁfth schedule of the Constitution, originated. Khunti is also birthplace of freedom ﬁghter Birsa Munda. Arjun Munda, the Union agriculture and tribal affairs minister, is once again taking on Kalicharan Munda of Congress, but the entry of Pathalgarhi movement protagonist Babita Kachchap on a Bharat Adivasi Party ticket has led to a recast of the poll arithmetic.BJP (G Kishan Reddy)G Kishan Reddy (BJP), Danam Nagender (Cong), T Padma Rao Goud (BRS)Seen as BJP’s only stronghold in Telangana, Secunderabad will see a direct contest between incumbent MP, Union tourism minister and state BJP chief G Kishan Reddy and local Congress MLA Danam Nagender. T Padama Rao Goud, the soft-spoken former deputy speaker, is the BRS candidate. BJP, which also won this seat in 2014, is expecting a hat-trick, banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal. But Nagender is a seasoned campaigner and Congress is upbeat about its chances.2019 WINNER: YSRCP (Margani Bharath)KEY CONTENDERS: Daggubati Purandeswari (BJP), Guduri Srinivas (YSRCP), Gidugu Rudra Raju (Cong)Andhra Pradesh BJP chief and former Visakhapatnam MP Daggubati Purandeswari has entered the Lok Sabha election fray from Rajahmundry — a constituency BJP has won twice and sees itself regaining. Incumbent Margani Bharath has been nominated by YSRCP for assembly polls, prompting the party to pick Dr Guduri Srinivas, a noted pulmonologist, as its LS candidate. It has all the trappings of a close contest with the trio of heavyweights battling it out. BJP is eyeing a boost from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in the constituency, which has lifted its cadre. A coastal area with urban and rural segments, development is an issue that reverberates here.2019 WINNER: YSRCP (Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy)KEY CONTENDERS: Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy (TDP), Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy (YSRCP)Sitting MP Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who won the 2019 election on a YSRCP ticket, switched to TDP and was declared the party’s candidate. A four-time MP from Ongole, 70-year-old Reddy brings five decades of political experience to the table. YSRCP has nominated Chandragiri MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, considered a troubleshooter by the party. MS Reddy, and Ongole by turn, have generated considerable interest, given that his son Raghav is an accused-turned-approver in the Delhi liquor policy case in which Arvind Kejriwal was arrested by ED.2019 WINNER: BJP (Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni)KEY CONTENDERS: Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni (BJP), Utkarsh Verma (SP), Anshay Kalra (BSP)The constituency in the Terai belt is known for its wheat and cane growers. On Oct 3, 2021, four protesting farmers and a journalist were run over by an SUV driven by MP Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish, and three persons accompanying Ashish were lynched. Teni, then junior home minister, wasn’t dropped from govt, with support for him seemingly unwavering. He is now hopeful of a hat-trick. SP, which lost its influential Kurmi family of Vermas (Ravi Prakash Verma) to Congress, has fielded another Kurmi, in two-time MLA Utkarsh Verma. The constituency has 18% Kurmis and 16% Brahmins. BSP has fielded realtor Anshay Kalra, a Punjabi.2019 WINNER: BJP (After Babul Supriyo’s defection, TMC’s Shatrughan Sinha won in 2022 bypoll)KEY CONTENDERS: Shatrughan Sinha (TMC), SS Ahluwalia (BJP), Jahanara Khan (CPM)With Shatrughan Sinha, TMC debuted in Asansol in the 2022 bypolls and won by a 3-lakh margin. It also won five of seven assembly segments here in 2021. BJP floundered with its initial candidate pick in Bhojpuri singer Pawan Singh, who was panned for misogynist songs. The party replaced him with veteran SS Ahluwalia. Asansol is Ahluwalia’s home, but the two polls he won were in Darjeeling (2014) and Bardhaman-Durgapur (2019). The region is demographically diverse and shares most of its borders with Dhanbad.2019 WINNER: JDU (Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh)KEY CONTENDERS: Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh (JDU) and Anita Devi (RJD)Two political titans — RJD president Lalu Prasad and JDU chief and CM Nitish Kumar — are indirectly locked in battle here. JDU’s Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh is considered close to Nitish and RJD’s pick was decided after Lalu’s intervention. This seat was once a Congress stronghold, but it has not elected an MP from the party for three decades. Lalan Singh finds the going tough after RJD gave a ticket to the wife of Nawada jailbreak convict Ashok Mahto. The don got married just ahead of the polls to get a ticket, as advised by Lalu. Lalan has faced mainly women rivals here. In 2014, he was defeated by LJP’s Veena Devi, wife of another don Suryabhan Singh, and in 2019, he defeated Nilam Devi, wife of don Anant Singh. Another don’s wife AnitaDevi is in the fray this time.2019 WINNER: LJP (Prince Raj)KEY CONTENDERS: Shambhavi Choudhary (LJP-RV) and Sunny Hazari (Cong)Located in north Bihar, Samastipur is the birthplace of socialist icon and former CM Karpoori Thakur, who was posthumously awarded the country’s highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna, earlier this year by the Modi govt. Children of two heavyweight JDU ministers are locked in a straight fight from different parties. LJP (Ram Vilas), led by Chirag Paswan, has fielded LSR and Delhi School of Economics graduate Shambhavi Choudhary, daughter of rural works department minister Ashok Choudhary. Congress has given a ticket to Sunny Hazari, son of information and PR minister Maheshwar Hazari. Both are contesting Lok Sabha polls for the first time. Spread over six assembly segments—four from Samastipur and two from Darbhanga district, this constituency has not elected a Congress candidate since 1977, when Thakur won. In the last LS poll, LJP candidate Prince Raj defeated Congress’s Ashok Kumar by more than one lakh votes, but the contest this time may be more challenging.2019 Winner: BJP (Sujay Vikhe Patil)Key contenders: Sujay Vikhe Patil (BJP), Nilesh Lanke NCP (SCP)This central Maharashtra seat has been a battleground between the Vikhe Patil family and Sharad Pawar. The split in NCP has sharpened the contest. Sujay, a thirdgeneration Vikhe Patil, is making a bid to retain the seat. Sharad Pawar has picked his nephew’s supporter and a popular MLA, who is a local, as his candidate. Lanke was with Ajit Pawar and keen on a ticket but was upset when the seat was again given to BJP, which is an ally of Ajit-led NCP. A close contest is expected with Sharad Pawar and his grand-nephew Rohit Pawar throwing their weight behind Lanke.2019 Winner: BRS (G Ranjith Reddy)Key contenders: G Ranjith Reddy (Cong), Konda Vishveshwar Reddy (BJP)Two of the richest politicians are pitted against each other from here. Konda Vishveshwar Reddy of BJP had won this seat in 2014 on a BRS ticket. He later joined Congress and lost the seat to Ranjith Reddy of BRS. Now, incumbent MP Ranjith is contesting on a Congress ticket. The constituency subsumes parts of the IT corridor of the city, some upmarket localities of Greater Hyderabad and the outskirts. KV Reddy, who declared assets worth Rs 4,568 crore, is banking on PM Modi’s charisma. Ranjith Reddy, who declared Rs 435 crore of assets, is confident of winning the seat due to what he says is “good performance” of the new Congress govt within 100 days of coming to office in the state. Kasani Gnaneshwar Mudiraj of BRS, who declared assets worth Rs 228 crore, will make it a three-horse race.2019 Winner: BJP (Bandi Sanjay Kumar)Key contenders: Bandi Sanjay Kumar (BJP), Velichala Rajender Rao (Cong), B Vinod Kumar (BRS)BJP’s national general secretary Bandi Sanjay is facing BRS candidate and former MP B Vinod Kumar, and Congress’s Velichala Rajender Rao here. Vinod Kumar served as Telangana planning board vice-chairman and was actively involved in the statehood agitation. He is known to be close to BRS chief K Chandrashekar Rao. He won this seat in 2014, when Telangana was formed, but lost the next election to Bandi Sanjay. This time, Congress was unable to select a candidate till the last minute, and picked Velichala Rajender, a district functionary, just ahead of the deadline. Karimnagar is Telangana’s cultural hub and was a hotbed of the statehood movement.2019 Winner: BJP (Sakshi Maharaj)Key contenders: Sakshi Maharaj (BJP), Annu Tandon (Cong), Ashok Kumar Pandey (BSP)Mercurial Sakshi Maharaj is eyeing a hat-trick from this constituency sandwiched between Lucknow and Kanpur. Like former CM Kalyan, Sakshi too is a Lodh, an influential OBC sub-caste in central UP. Confident of victory, he has been belting out his slogan, “Dhailakh Lodhi, baaki saare Modi (there are 2.5 lakh Lodhs, rest all are Modi supporters)”. But INDIA bloc’s Annu Tandon has put up a challenge. A former corporate hand, she made a resounding debut from the seat as a Congress candidate in 2009, defeating SP strongman Aruna Shankar Anna by over three lakh votes. But she finished fourth in 2014 and third in 2019.2019 Winner: BJP (Ram Shankar Katheria)Key contenders: Ram Shankar Katheria (BJP), Jitendra Dohare (SP), Sarika Singh Baghel (BSP)The ‘karmabhoomi’ of SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, the constituency was reserved for SCs in 2009. BJP has won two out of three elections after that and is eyeing another win through its prominent Dalit face Ram Shankar Katheria. From Etawah, Katheria, who has his roots in RSS and is a professor at Agra University, is eyeing his fourth term as an MP. He won from Etawah in 2019, and Agra in 2014 and 2009. SP has fielded Jitendra Dohare and BSP is banking on former MP Sarika Singh Baghel to make it a strong contest. Baghel had won from Hathras on an RLD ticket in 2009 to become one of the youngest MPs that year. She later moved to SP and then to BJP. She joined BSP recently. Dohare, a Jatav like Katheria and Baghel, started his political career from BSP in 2005 and joined SP in 2020. Dalits, Yadavs and Lodhs make up the biggest chunks of the local population.2019 Winner: BJP (SS Ahluwalia)Key contenders: Kirti Azad (TMC), Dilip Ghosh (BJP), Sukriti Ghosh (CPM)If Trinamool pitchforked Kirti Azad as its party candidate here, BJP packed a bigger surprise by asking Dilip Ghosh, its former state president, to vacate Midnapore Lok Sabha seat and fight from Bardhaman-Durgapur. Sitting BJP MP SS Ahluwalia was asked to contest in Asansol. Since 2009, (when this seat was carved out), no party has won from here twice in a row. But Ghosh does not believe in precedence, neither does Azad, as they slog in the rice bowl to rewrite their political careers. On the face of it, TMC is well entrenched here; it won six of the seven assembly seats. But Ghosh, who had made his debut in 2016 by defeating six-time Congress MLA Gyan Singh Sohanpal in Kharagpur, is known to pull off upsets.2019 Winner: Cong (Geeta Koda)Key contenders: Geeta Koda (BJP) and Joba Majhi (JMM)Consisting of six STreserved assembly segments, Singhbhum LS seat has swung between Congress and BJP. This time, it’s a BJP-JMM battle as INDIA bloc has fielded Joba Majhi against Congress turncoat Geeta Koda. The constituency includes Asia’s largest saal forest where iron-ore mining and ecological damage have been key concerns. Mines in Saranda form the backbone of SAIL and Tata Steel but this region struggles with abject poverty. Geeta Koda’s husband Madhu Koda has worked with the local population and is confident of converting support for him into votes for his wife. Campaigning was difficult here as Maoists made the region one of their bases.2019 Winner: BJP (Pritam Munde)KEY CONTENDERS: Pankaja Munde (BJP), Bajrang Sonawane (NCP-SCP)It is a comeback opportunity for Pankaja Munde, who lost the 2019 assembly election to her cousin Dhananjay Munde and has felt sidelined in BJP. Pankaja’s sister Pritam was elected to Parliament by the highest-ever margin of nearly seven lakh votes in the 2014 bypoll after her father Gopinath Munde’s death. She was reelected in 2019. This election, with Pritam sittting out, Pankaja will face the opponent her sister defeated in the last election. Sonawane, who switched from Ajit Pawar’s camp to Sharad Pawar’s group, has considerable groundwork to his credit.","This phase also sees Odisha kick off its 4-leg assembly polls. In Bengal, watch out for crackling INDIA vs INDIA fights. Andhra, where TDP-BJP-JSP alliance would hope to do signiﬁcantly better than 3 seats TDP won last time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110065772,imgsize-39746,width-400,resizemode-4/110065772.jpg"

2019 WINNER: YSRCP (Margani Bharath)KEY CONTENDERS: Daggubati Purandeswari ( BJP ), Guduri Srinivas (YSRCP), Gidugu Rudra Raju (Cong) Andhra Pradesh BJP chief and former Visakhapatnam MP Daggubati Purandeswari has entered the Lok Sabha election fray from Rajahmundry — a constituency BJP has won twice and sees itself regaining. Incumbent Margani Bharath has been nominated by YSRCP for assembly polls, prompting the party to pick Dr Guduri Srinivas, a noted pulmonologist, as its LS candidate.It has all the trappings of a close contest with the trio of heavyweights battling it out. BJP is eyeing a boost from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in the constituency, which has lifted its cadre. A coastal area with urban and rural segments, development is an issue that reverberates here.2019 WINNER: YSRCP (Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy)KEY CONTENDERS: Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy (TDP), Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy (YSRCP)Sitting MP Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who won the 2019 election on a YSRCP ticket, switched to TDP and was declared the party’s candidate. A four-time MP from Ongole, 70-year-old Reddy brings five decades of political experience to the table. YSRCP has nominated Chandragiri MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, considered a troubleshooter by the party. MS Reddy, and Ongole by turn, have generated considerable interest, given that his son Raghav is an accused-turned-approver in the Delhi liquor policy case in which Arvind Kejriwal was arrested by ED.2019 WINNER: BJP (Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni)KEY CONTENDERS: Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni (BJP), Utkarsh Verma (SP), Anshay Kalra (BSP)The constituency in the Terai belt is known for its wheat and cane growers. On Oct 3, 2021, four protesting farmers and a journalist were run over by an SUV driven by MP Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish, and three persons accompanying Ashish were lynched. Teni, then junior home minister, wasn’t dropped from govt, with support for him seemingly unwavering. He is now hopeful of a hat-trick. SP, which lost its influential Kurmi family of Vermas (Ravi Prakash Verma) to Congress , has fielded another Kurmi, in two-time MLA Utkarsh Verma. The constituency has 18% Kurmis and 16% Brahmins. BSP has fielded realtor Anshay Kalra, a Punjabi.2019 WINNER: BJP (After Babul Supriyo’s defection, TMC’s Shatrughan Sinha won in 2022 bypoll)KEY CONTENDERS: Shatrughan Sinha (TMC), SS Ahluwalia (BJP), Jahanara Khan (CPM)With Shatrughan Sinha, TMC debuted in Asansol in the 2022 bypolls and won by a 3-lakh margin. It also won five of seven assembly segments here in 2021. BJP floundered with its initial candidate pick in Bhojpuri singer Pawan Singh, who was panned for misogynist songs. The party replaced him with veteran SS Ahluwalia. Asansol is Ahluwalia’s home, but the two polls he won were in Darjeeling (2014) and Bardhaman-Durgapur (2019). The region is demographically diverse and shares most of its borders with Dhanbad.2019 WINNER: JDU (Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh)KEY CONTENDERS: Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh (JDU) and Anita Devi (RJD)Two political titans — RJD president Lalu Prasad and JDU chief and CM Nitish Kumar — are indirectly locked in battle here. JDU’s Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh is considered close to Nitish and RJD’s pick was decided after Lalu’s intervention. This seat was once a Congress stronghold, but it has not elected an MP from the party for three decades. Lalan Singh finds the going tough after RJD gave a ticket to the wife of Nawada jailbreak convict Ashok Mahto. The don got married just ahead of the polls to get a ticket, as advised by Lalu.

"Rahul Gandhi moots debate with PM Modi; he’s merely an MP, mocks BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-moots-debate-with-pm-modi-hes-merely-an-mp-mocks-bjp/articleshow/110043683.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to Rahul Gandhi ’s call for a face-to-face debate on Lok Sabha elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP on Saturday questioned his knowledge of poll issues as well as his standing in Congress party, noting that he is neither the president of his party nor the leader of opposition in Parliament.At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi asked in what capacity is Gandhi looking to debate with Modi as he is merely an MP of his party.The remark comes as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion and expressed hope that PM Modi would also take part. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X. He also added that the nation expects Modi to participate in the debate.Rahul’s post was in reply to Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, Justice (Retd) Ajit P Shah and senior journalist N Ram, who had written to him and the PM earlier this week, inviting them to a platform for a debate on the key election issues.“Congress welcomes this initiative and accepts the invitation for a discussion,” Rahul said. “We agree that such a debate will help people understand our respective vision and enable them to make an informed choice. It is also critical to put to rest any unsubstantiated allegations attributed to our respective parties. As the principal parties fighting the election, the public deserves to hear from their leaders directly. Accordingly, either myself or the Congress President would be pleased to participate in such a debate,” he added.In the invite addressed to PM Modi and Rahul, it was pointed out that the PM has publicly challenged Congress on reservations, Article 370 and wealth redistribution. On the other hand, Kharge has questioned the PM on possible “mutilation” of the Constitution, electoral bond scheme and the govt’s response to China and also challenged him to a public debate. In this backdrop, a debate will help the citizens to hear directly from the political leaders, the invite said.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said he or party chief Mallikarjun Kharge would be pleased to participate in such a discussion. “It would be a positive initiative for the major parties to present their vision to the country from one platform for a healthy democracy,” Rahul wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110043668,imgsize-51232,width-400,resizemode-4/110043668.jpg"
"On polling eve, protests erupt in Andhra Pradesh demanding cash ‘promised’ for votes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-polling-eve-protests-erupt-in-andhra-pradesh-demanding-cash-promised-for-votes/articleshow/110061754.cms,"VIJAYAWADA: A wave of demonstrations swept through at least five places across Andhra Pradesh on Sunday, with many people demanding money from political parties in exchange for votes. The issue is not new in the state, but as inflation rises, so does the price for votes. Sources said cash-for-votes in various assembly and parliamentary constituencies ranged from Rs 1,000 to Rs 6,000.Polling will be held in AP for 175 assembly and 25 LS seats on Monday.Campaigning concluded Saturday evening, but the alleged distribution of money continued in some places. In Palnadu's Sattenapalli, voters from 18th ward took to the streets to protest, claiming they were promised money for their votes, but they never received it.Similar scenes were seen in Pithapuram, where voters near the office of a contesting politician protested. The party supporters allegedly promised Rs 5,000 for each vote, but failed to deliver on their promises to some women voters, prompting protests . The situation escalated, requiring police intervention to disperse the crowd.In Ongole, where Rs 5,000 per vote was allegedly distributed, triggering protests when some people were left out. In Kondevaram village of East Godavari district, many people staged demonstrations, alleging that they were excluded from receiving payments.According to sources, cash is being distributed in the offices of certain municipal corporators in Vijayawada. A man, who doesn't want to be identified, said an MLA candidate from Vijayawada had dispatched a close associate to a corporator's office, where Rs 1,000 was distributed in exchange for votes.For candidates lacking proper offices, arrangements have been made to gather their supporters and voters at specific locations, where sums ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 are being handed out to each voter. Aware of their rivals' offerings, parties are reportedly giving Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 more than their competitors to entice voters, said a shopkeeper in Amaravati. The confrontations highlight broader concerns about corruption within the electoral system. ""These types of protests are a clear indication of the need for stringent enforcement of electoral laws and a crackdown on corruption within the voting process,"" said Lakshmaiah, a retired teacher. ""Authorities must investigate and hold the guilty parties accountable.""In northern Andhra, candidates faced unexpected demands from urban voters living in apartments, group housing, and gated communities.

What happened in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections?

2019 Assembly elections result

NEW DELHI: With the campaigning closed for the elections in Andhra Pradesh, the stage is all set for polling on Monday to elect the 175-member assembly and as well as 25 Lok Sabha seats from the state. A neck-to-neck competition is going on between YSRCP , TDP , and Janasena among others in the Assembly and Lok Sabha poll race.The YSRCP has entered the electoral fray, vying for all 175 Assembly seats and 25 Lok Sabha segments in the state.Through a seat-sharing arrangement within the NDA coalition, the TDP has been granted 144 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies, whereas the BJP is set to compete in six Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly seats. The Janasena, on the other hand, will vie for two Lok Sabha and 21 Assembly seats.The YSRCP campaign emphasized the welfare initiatives it enacted over the past five years, while the NDA focused on criticizing the perceived ""failures"" of the state government and pledged to offer benefits if elected, along with promises of job creation. Notable figures such as PM Modi, along with Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, as well as Congress leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge, actively participated in campaigning for their respective party candidates.Voters will be making the choice between siblings as YS Sharmila Reddy, Congress candidate, is going to contest the election against his brother YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's party YSRCP's candidate YS Avinash Reddy, who also happens to be their cousin, for the Kadapa Lok Sabha seat.Meanwhile, in the Assembly polls, the stakes are high for all Andhra parties in Rayalaseema, as both YSRCP supremo Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu hail from this region and are contesting from Pulivendula in Kadapa and Kuppam in Chittoor districts, respectively.To ensure the smooth conduct of the elections, the Election Commission has mobilized 1.06 lakh security personnel, comprising 3,500 Karnataka police, 4,500 Tamil Nadu police, 1,614 ex-servicemen, 246 retired police personnel, and others. Voting will commence at 7 AM and conclude at 6 PM across the state, with exceptions in a few areas where it will end one or two hours earlier.

TMC is still batting for him.” Addressing four election rallies in the state — one each in Barrackpore and Howrah, apart from two in Hooghly — Modi accused the Bengal police of trying to save Sandeshkhali’s tormentors.He said that after CBI arrested Shahjahan, bombs and arms were recovered from his house. “Now, TMC is busy giving him a clean chit. There was a time when Bengal waged war against infiltrators; now, they are being protected.”The PM’s attack on TMC comes in the backdrop of two ‘survivors’ from Sandeshkhali denying the rape charges . One of them disclosed that she was egged on by BJP leaders to sign on a blank paper. This prompted TMC to allege that the Sandeshkhali issue was a BJP narrative.Modi blamed TMC for its “appeasement politics” to claim that Hindus had become “second-class citizens” in Bengal, even becoming “the minority” at many places in the state. Chanting “Jai Shri Ram” to cheering crowds, the PM said: “TMC does not even allow you to take Ram’s name. They don’t allow you to perform Ram Navami here... They would even prefer to drop the word ‘Ram’ from Raja Rammohan Roy’s name.”PM tried to tie TMC’s alleged appeasement to INDIA bloc’s “negligence of SCs, STs and OBCs”, vowing five guarantees. “As long as I am here, there will be no religion-based reservation. As long as I am here, no one can finish SC, ST and OBC reservation. As long as I am here, no one can stop you from worshipping Lord Ram and celebrating Ram Navami. As long as I am here, no one can overturn Supreme Court’s judgment on Ram temple. As long as I am here, no one will be able to abolish CAA,” he said at the Barrackpore rally.Taking a dig at TMC for its barb that BJP is a party of “bahiragata (outsiders)”, he said: “They refer to the people from other states as ‘bahiragata’, but allow infiltrators. They can go to any extent to please their vote bank .”",Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Trinamool Congress of “playing a new game’ in Sandeshkhali.

He added, “Govt schools in India are in bad shape. We will arrange good quality education. Rashtra Sarvopari is our guarantee. China has occupied our land, and we will free it from their occupation.”Taking a dig at PM Modi’s Ayushman Bharat scheme without naming it, Kejriwal said, “Under ‘INDIA’ govt, everyone will be treated for free. No one will be treated on basis of insurance as this is a big scam.” He alleged Modi did not fulfill most of his promises, including the one to set up smart cities. “Modiji’s guarantees are not worth believing; there is no answer as to who will fulfill his guarantee after his ‘retirement’ (as PM) next year,” he said.Taking a dig at Agniveer scheme, Kejriwal said, “Youths are recruited into the Army and fired after four years, thus weakening the Army. Agniveer will be discontinued. This contract system will be stopped and the children will again get permanent jobs.”Iterating his claim that PM Modi would retire after 75 years, Kejriwal said while many BJP netas have come out in PM’s support since he spoke on this issue on Saturday, Modi has not till now said anything on it. “It is clear from this PM will not obey rules made by him,” Kejriwal added.He also said, “It has been more than 24 hours, but since no BJP neta has said Yogi ji will not be removed as UP CM (as claimed by Kejriwal), it is clear he will be removed after two months.”Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said it was ridiculous for a party (AAP) contesting in only 21 Lok Sabha seats and unlikely to win a single seat claiming to form a govt at the Centre. Kejriwal is an expert in selling false dreams, he added. “He (CM) knows that he will be wiped out from Delhi in Feb 2025. So he wants to remain in the news by saying anything,” Sachdeva said.“Not a single new school or college has been opened in Delhi in the past 10 years, and Kejriwal is claiming to open schools in every village of the country. Mohalla clinics in Delhi are in rickety condition and many have shut down or become a hub of scam involving pathological and other tests. LNJP is a big Delhi govt hospital but has no MRI machine; patients get a date for ultrasound only after a year or so. Even Delhi HC has reprimanded AAP govt on poor health services,” Sachdeva said, adding, “It became clear how much Kejriwal respects our soldiers the day he asked for proof of the surgical strike.”","Delhi CM lists 10 pledges, including granting full statehood to Delhi, scrapping Agniveer scheme and simplifying GST.

Number of tests by 2 private labs at Mohalla clinics sees 80% dip since ACB report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/number-of-tests-by-2-private-labs-at-mohalla-clinics-sees-80-dip-since-acb-report/articleshow/110062106.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of pathological tests conducted by two private diagnostic laboratories at mohalla clinics has registered a decline of nearly 80% since the anti-corruption branch of Delhi govt submitted its report on a preliminary enquiry into alleged irregularities to CBI in Feb this year.According to a report prepared by the health and family welfare department of Delhi govt, linking Aadhaar with patients’ mobile numbers was made mandatory after an initial inquiry in Dec 2023 indicated the possibility of irregularities and ghost patients, which led to a huge drop in the number of path tests.According to the report, both the number of patients tested and tests conducted at the two laboratories registered a sharp decline. Between Feb 2023 and April 2023, the two laboratories together tested 2,40,850 patients and conducted 7,52,186 tests. However, the number fell to 50,959 patients and 153,902 tests between Feb 2024 and April 2024 (till April 21).AAP govt in Delhi has outsourced the lab investigation services to Agilus Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare for mohalla clinics and state-run dispensaries, hospitals and polyclinics. Anti-Corruption Bureau’s preliminary findings suggested a potential scam involving “fake or manipulated” tests.When contacted, Delhi govt said there was a lot of pressure on doctors of mohalla clinics to reduce the number of pathological tests. It added that a number of patients from lower and middle-income groups were widely using the free pathological tests services of mohalla clinics and even those who were consulting central govt hospitals like AIIMS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia were availing of this facility.Agilus Diagnostics Ltd, in a statement, said that patient registration, including the linkage through Aadhaar or other IDs for each patient, was the responsibility of Delhi govt staff at health facilities. “Agilus Diagnostics solely manages the testing process for samples received at its laboratory from these health facilities. We would like to mention that there has been a significant increase in referrals and tests conducted since mid-March 2024,” the company said.There was no response from Metropolis Healthcare Limited.ACB had conducted an analysis of pathological tests done at the city’s mohalla clinics between Feb and Dec last year and found “massive irregularities”. The investigating agency , in its PE report, stated that the two pathological laboratories had together conducted nearly 2.2 million tests across the city between Feb and Dec 2023, of which at least 65,000 tests, out of a random sample of 1.15 lakh, were “found to be fake or manipulated”.“There is a serious lapse/misconduct on the part of the district nodal officer, cluster in charge, and project director who failed to supervise and monitor the scrutiny of tests properly. The data indicates a massive fraud, manipulation of records by the outsourced labs with an intention to create a huge loss to the govt exchequer amounting to crores of rupees,” an ACB mentioned in the PE.Following an impact assessment study conducted earlier in seven mohalla clinics by the health and family welfare department of Delhi govt, LG VK Saxena had recommended a CBI investigation into it. A separate inquiry by ACB was also recommended in the case.According to ACB’s PE report, mentioning the name and mobile number of the patient was compulsory for making an entry in the Lab Information Management System, as the reports were also required to be sent to the registered mobile number. Since the system was designed and developed by the outsourced agencies, they had full control and access over the entire data.“Hence, the possibility of manipulation of data by the outsourced lab vendors could not be ruled out,” the report added. ACB had also conducted random tele-verification of mobile numbers of patients at both private labs, which revealed that a large number of tests were conducted on either invalid mobile numbers or mobile numbers not related to the patients.A large number of tests was allegedly done without the presence of treating doctors.","Delhi govt has outsourced the lab investigation services to Agilus Diagnostics and Metropolis Healthcare for mohalla clinics and state-run dispensaries, hospitals and polyclinics. Anti-Corruption Bureau’s preliminary findings suggested a potential scam involving “fake or manipulated” tests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110063478,imgsize-365296,width-400,resizemode-4/110063478.jpg"
"2 new videos emerge, give TMC ammo to target BJP over ‘Mission Sandeshkhali’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-new-videos-emerge-give-tmc-ammo-to-target-bjp-over-mission-sandeshkhali/articleshow/110061675.cms,"SANDESHKHALI: The controversy surrounding Bengal BJP ’s Sandeshkhali block-II mandal president Gangadhar Koyal took a new turn Sunday with the emergence of a second sting video and an interview with a purported “rape survivor”, further fuelling Trinamool Congress’s allegations that the entire issue was a “BJP narrative engineered for political purposes”.The newly surfaced sting video, tweeted by TMC, purportedly shows Koyal detailing the expenses incurred by BJP for “Mission Sandeshkhali”. “Around 72 women in Sandeshkhali received Rs 2,000 each to be involved in the movement,” he is heard saying.Koyal, who moved Calcutta high court last week alleging voice manipulation using AI, is seen discussing (with a person who isn’t identified) providing arms, ammunition, and liquor to the protesters to continue with the movement. When the person asks about firearms, Koyal says: “Around 50 pistols are required as 30 guns for Manipur and 20 for Korakati (two gram panchayats) will be used. Twelve rounds of cartridges will be needed for each pistol. These will also be removed immediately once the operation is over.”Asked about the money, Koyal replies: ”It should be Rs 1 lakh. Then we will manage everything. Besides, 10 cellphones are also required to operate the movement smoothly.” Koyal is also purportedly seen admitting that BJP MLA and leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has made the arrangements for money and mobile phones.A second video emerged later in the day, featuring an interview with a woman claiming to be a “rape survivor”.She denies any sexual abuse and accuses local BJP functionaries, including Papiya Das alias Mampi, of coercing her to sign a blank piece of paper to lodge false complaints.Another woman had made similar statements earlier and lodged a complaint against Das.“It was my brothers who had actually launched the movement in the beginning and were arrested by police. That left us in the lurch. Taking advantage of the situation, BJP members, including Mampi, coerced us to lodge false complaints of sexual assault.“There was no rape or any kind of sexual harassment in Sandeshkhali. I have now mustered up the courage by following other women, who have already raised their voices to withdraw the false complainants,” the woman says in the interview.In videos that emerged Wednesday and Thursday, two other women had also claimed that they were forced to lodge complaints after being made to sign blank papers.BJP’s Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra dismissed the allegations, calling them “bogus and baseless” and attributing them to a Trinamool conspiracy. “All the complainants lodged their complaints on their own. Nobody forced them,” she said.In response, Trinamool’s Sandeshkhali MLA Sukumar Mahato said: “The facts are coming out one after another.“We have been saying for so long that BJP is playing dirty politics over Sandeshkhali. Innocent women were forced to make false complaints. They didn’t even know the nature of the complaints.”","BJP’s Basirhat candidate Rekha Patra dismissed the allegations, calling them “bogus and baseless” and attributing them to a Trinamool conspiracy.

Indian govt had said last week that there has been no “formal diplomatic communication” on the arrests.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that Singh was arrested on May 11 for his role in the killing of Nijjar. He was already in the custody of the Peel Regional Police for unrelated firearms charges, the release said.“This arrest shows the nature of our ongoing investigation to hold responsible those that played a role in the homicide of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,” said Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, IHIT officer-in-charge.“IHIT pursued the evidence and gained sufficient information for the British Columbia Prosecution Service to charge Amandeep Singh with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder,” the police statement said.Investigators said no further details of the arrest can be released due to ongoing investigations and court processes.IHIT investigators on May 3 arrested three Indian nationals — Karan Brar (22), Kamalpreet Singh (22) and 28-year-old Karanpreet Singh — for the murder of Nijjar.

We are proud that PoK is ours and India's claim on it will always be there,"" Shah said at a rally in Rae Bareli that elected Sonia Gandhi MP till 2019.She stepped out of the LS fray this time and was elected Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan recently. Rahul then took the baton.Shah's statement on PoK followed similar declarations at rallies in Telangana and elsewhere in the past few days. They came in response to a video of Mani Shankar Aiyar in which he is purportedly heard saying ""India should give respect to Pakistan as it is a sovereign nation, and India should engage with it as it also possesses an atom bomb"". Former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah has made similar remarks.In Kaushambi , Shah reiterated that ""PoK is an integral part of India and we will take it back"". ""Rahul Gandhi may be scared of (Pakistan's) atom bombs, but we are not,"" he said. The home minister accused Congress and its allies of nurturing Article 370 like an ""illegitimate child"" for nearly 70 years. ""The step ended years of terrorism and made Kashmir an integral part of the country,"" Shah said. He claimed ""shehzaades (princes)"" Rahul and his ally Akhilesh Yadav would bring back Article 370 if they formed the govt.In Rae Bareli, Shah held up the LS seat as a showpiece, saying BJP's victory in the Congress bastion ""would be equivalent to winning 400 seats across the country"". ""Let the lotus bloom in Rae Bareli, our target of winning 400 seats will be accomplished,"" Shah said at the rally for Rae Bareli BJP nominee Dinesh Pratap Singh. Singh had contested in 2019, too, but lost to Sonia.Shah said Rahul should answer five questions before seeking votes from the people of Rae Bareli. He listed them thus: ""He should tell people whether banning triple talaq was good or bad, and are you planning to bring it back? Shouldn't a country have a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) instead of All-India Muslim Personal Law? Were you in support of surgical and air strikes (after the Pulwama and Uri attacks)? Why didn't you visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya? Do you support the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir?""Shah said many say Rae Bareli was a seat of the ""Nehru-Gandhi Parivar"". ""But I want to ask how many times Sonia or any of her family members turned up in the constituency when the people were in distress? Never,"" Shah said, reeling off some tragedies in the area when he alleged the Gandhis were absent.Shah claimed Sonia spent 70% of her MP Local Area Development Funds (MPLAD) as Rae Bareli's lawmaker only on minority welfare while turning a blind eye towards other communities. The home minister accused the Gandhis of ""creating a fence"" around Rae Bareli and isolating it from welfare measures initiated by the Narendra Modi govt in the last 10 years. ""Tear down this fence,"" he declared.In Kaushambi, Shah urged voters to elect two-time BJP MP Vinod Kumar again and ensure Modi returns as PM for the third time. He slammed Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh for indulging in ""politics over Covid vaccination"" and said only PM Modi could have tackled the pandemic so well.","Shah's statement on PoK followed similar declarations at rallies in Telangana and elsewhere in the past few days.

In 1991, Vadodara's district judge conducted an unannounced inspection of the ""muddamal"" at the Chhota Udepur court. Due to paucity of time, the district judge decided to continue the inspection the next day. He handed over the dominion of the strongroom to the civil judge and asked him to keep the key.The district judge's visit was not possible the next day, but he turned up a day later, on Nov 16, 1991, to resume the inspection. Some envelopes were found torn and cash worth Rs 80,833 was found missing along with a few silver ornaments and a wristwatch from the ""muddamal.""The missing cash and valuables from the ""muddamal"" led the civil judge and judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) of the court to file a criminal complaint against Saiyed, then the nazir of the court, for misappropriation of cash and valuables in his custody. During the trial, the court's peon testified that the complainant JMFC himself had opened the strongroom on Nov 15, 1991, after office hours, despite the peon and an in charge nazir telling him that the district judge had barred anyone from entering the area in the middle of inspection.In 2000, a trial court held Saiyed guilty and sentenced him to seven years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. The punishment was upheld by an appellate court. This brought Saiyed to the HC.Advocate Zubin Bharda, who represented Saiyed, underscored that Saiyed was on leave that day. The district judge had given the dominion of the strongroom to the judge, and Saiyed was not even in charge of the strongroom. Still, just because a judge had filed the complaint, the court staff was held guilty. The lower courts wrongly attached more importance to the judge's statement than the statement of the peon. This is against the provisions of the Evidence Act , particularly when both - the judge and the peon - are prosecution witnesses.","Akbarali Saiyed, 85, was a nazir (curator) at a civil court in Chhota Udepur, Gujarat.

"Son, daughter of two JD(U) mantris locked in Samastipur contest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/son-daughter-of-two-jdu-mantris-locked-in-samastipur-contest/articleshow/110061293.cms,"PATNA: At a poll rally for NDA candidates in Darbhanga recently, PM Modi was seen blessing a woman candidate in fray from Samastipur . Seated next to the PM, she kept her palms folded and head bowed as a mark of respect to him.""Give your votes to LJP (Ram Vilas) candidate Shambhavi Chaudhary . She is the youngest nominee in the entire country. Our daughter should win,"" the PM had said.Shambhavi (25) is the daughter of minister Ashok Chaudhary in the Nitish-led Bihar govt. She is pitted against Congress's Sunny Hazari (29), son of another mantri, Maheshwar Hazari .Formed in 2008 after delimitation, the Samastipur seat will go the polls on May 13. The seat is reserved for SCs.Shambhavi, who speaks fluently in English and Hindi, did her graduation in sociology from Lady Sri Ram College and PG from Delhi School of Economics. She also completed her PhD from Amity University. Shambhavi (a Dalit) married Shayan Kunal (an upper caste Bhumihar) last year.Sunny, on the other hand, is an engineer from NIT, Patna. Both Shambhavi and Sunny have gone on record saying they had to be in politics to carry forward their family legacy and do something for the development of the constituency.It wouldn't have been surprising to see both Sunny and Shambhavi vying for a JD(U) ticket from Samastipur, given that their fathers are close to Nitish. But by Nov last year, Ashok Chaudhary had forged ahead by organising Bhim Sansad at Patna - or a state-level meeting of Dalits - mobilised from across the state under the banner of JD(U).After this, Shambhavi joined LJP(RV), a party that works for uplift of Dalits, while Sunny joined Congress and became its Khanpur block chief.As for the family legacy, Shambhavi's grandfather, Mahavir Chaudhary, had a long career in state politics as an MLA from the late 1960s. On the other hand, Sunny's grandfather, Ram Sewak Hazari, was a six-time MLA from Samastipur district.Now, Ashok is camping at Samastipur to campaign for Shambhavi, while Maheshwar is in Patna to reach out to people of Samastipur - a seat he represented in 2009. So Samastipur, in a way, has also become a battleground for the fathers of the two candidates.","Shambhavi (25) is the daughter of minister Ashok Chaudhary in the Nitish-led Bihar govt.

On test in Andhra assembly polls: Jagan's welfare delivery model with pvt partner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-test-in-andhra-assembly-polls-jagans-welfare-delivery-model-with-pvt-partner/articleshow/110061297.cms,"Andhra's Assembly polls on Monday will decide the fate of not only CM Jagan Mohan Reddy but also the governance model he's built in the last five years.Soon after taking office in 2019, Reddy initiated a volunteer system akin to 'customer relationship managers' at banks. In a bid to create a single-point contact for delivery of essential services, a volunteer was deputed for every 40-45 households, and a secretariat or office for every 1,000 households.Pitched as 'government at doorstep', the system was expanded to provide certification (for income, marriage, birth and death), health services like free tests for lifestyle and chronic diseases, and cash transfers through direct benefit transfer.While similar services have been offered by other govts, like Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, YSRCP's Andhra model differs in that a political strategy firm, I-PAC, takes care of strategy, feedback and publicity. Reddy started working with I-PAC for his poll campaign in 2019, when he swept 151 of 175 Assembly seats and 50% vote share.In the last quarter of 2022, I-PAC - now headed by co-founder Rishi Raj Singh - started work to create a narrative around govt welfare schemes implemented through DBT and the volunteer system. Singh is an IIT alum and ex-investment banker who has worked on multiple poll campaigns, including for Narendra Modi in 2014, Amarinder Singh in Punjab (2017), and with Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi in 2020.""This is the first time we've been involved in grassroots governance over a period of two years. We've worked closely with the chief minister on the contours of the strategy,"" Singh says.The schemes are aimed at every section - 'Amma Vodi' for mothers who send their children to school, 'Rythu Bharosa' for farmers, pensions for old and disabled, 'Vidya Deevena' for students, etc.I-PAC claims over 93 lakh certificates related to birth, death and marriage were issued in the first 35 days of the scheme, and over 62 lakh people have received free treatment at some 12,000 camps across the state. 'Amma Vodi' has 44 lakh beneficiaries and 'Vidya Deevena' over 29 lakh.A physically-challenged pensioner, Sunkara Naga Brahmam, says, ""Volunteers deliver pension in cash at our doorstep. When I fell sick with Covid in 2021, volunteers came home, gave us pension and medicines when even our relatives ignored us.""The welfare scheme has had its share of controversy, with the opposition alleging citizen data is being shared with a private firm and political representatives are threatened by 'outsiders'.Lakkoju Siva Parvati, an old-age pensioner, says, ""While volunteers have been very helpful, there is a flip side as they insisted that we support the ruling party. They threatened that we will be declared ineligible for welfare schemes if we fail to attend public meetings of the government or ruling party. We are under threat of cancellation of our welfare schemes if we do not follow their instructions.""I-PAC campaign managers, however, deny any interference or intimidation and claim the volunteers act as last-mile delivery partners.As Reddy's 'Memantha Siddham Yatra' (we are all ready) ends, he is hopeful his promises or 'navratnalus' will hold good. The election campaign was a mirror image of his Prajasankalp Padyatra in 2019 when he covered over 3,000km on foot over a year, from Idupulapaya (Kadapa) to Ichchapuram (Srikakulam).The campaign graduated to the slogan 'Jagan Kasom Siddham' (people's cry for Jagan). With movie dialogues and a catchy campaign song 'Maa Namakkam Nuvve Jagan' (Jagan is our belief), the effort was to stay top-of-mind.In March, Opposition leader and ex-chief minister Chandrababu Naidu of TDP went to the EC complaining that the volunteer system's continuation was a violation of the code of conduct and had the doorstep delivery of pensions stopped. He had also been strident in his criticism of the system but later backtracked to say that not only would welfare reforms and the volunteer scheme be continued but that the honorarium to volunteers would be doubled.Whether Jagan stays on as chief minister, only June will tell; but his model of governance - or at least some parts of it - may well live on.","Andhra's Assembly polls on Monday will decide the fate of CM Jagan Mohan Reddy.

'Power struggle' in Nandurbar: Voters want their homes lit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-struggle-in-nandurbar-voters-want-their-homes-lit/articleshow/110061265.cms,"NANDURBAR : When Binkibai Pawara took her husband to hospital some eight years ago, she stayed awake the entire night thinking it was daytime. Sounds unbelievable? Not really. Binkibai was seeing an electric light for the first time in her life.As the tribal district of Nandurbar spanning across the Satpura range in the northernmost part of Maharashtra gets ready to vote in the fourth phase, there is only one overwhelming demand of the villagers - electricity .Bhadal village, from where Binikibai hails, is a place where promises of progress are made every five years but never kept. ""For 40 years, we had been voting for one candidate who promised us road and electricity. We got neither. Fed up, we decided to vote for another party in 2014 that promised us the same things. We waited for 10 years and finally got a road in 2024 and are happy about it. We now hope that electricity will come to us...maybe in the next 5 or 10 years,"" said a villager.In 2014, Hina Gavit of BJP won against her grandfather and eight-term MP Manikrao Gavit of Congress in the Nandurbar LS constituency.Sarpanch Master Pawara said, ""Since the time of my father and grandfather, hamlets have been voting on the promise of electricity and a road. For 75 years, we had no electricity. At least, this govt gave us a road after 10 years. How much more can we expect?""Pawara was a Congress worker but grew tired of the neglect and switched to BJP. ""We really don't care how big a leader is and who is putting the country on the international map. Our needs are very basic,"" Pawara added.Villagers said they have given forty years to one party and are ready to give the same time to another. ""I'm sure they will give us electricity"".Sangita Dinesh Pawara, another villager, has no hope of getting electricity anytime soon but plans to vote for the candidate who promises to give it. ""We must believe in them and vote. My parents in Taloda have electricity. I never imagined a hamlet without power until I got married and came to Bhadal. We have been living in darkness. All functions, even marriages, take place in the dark or under cellphone's torch,"" she added.The villagers have some solar panels which they use to recharge their phones. However, the power is not enough to illuminate their homes which are barely lit. Adding to their woes, these panels become useless during monsoon, leaving them without any source of power.In nearby Bhabari village, Raijabai Pawara (52) gets light in her kitchen from a burning log from her challah. She also isn't very hopeful about getting power. ""No govt cared for us. The solar lamps are dim and if I use a torch while cooking, insects are drawn to the fire and drop on food. So, I hold a burning stick in one hand while cooking. Every election, candidates promise us electricity, but nothing has been done in 50 years,"" she said in despair.Along with Bhadal and Bhabari, five hamlets of Jhapi, Falai, Sindi, Kudadya are also without electricity.Master Pawara said solar panels were distributed in 2021 in villages around Toranmal hill station, except Bhadal. However, govt records show that 192 panels were distributed in the hamlet. When he followed up the matter, he was told they will only get the remaining 74. ""Mag kai karnar? Amhi 74 solar panel gheun alo,"" (What could we do, we brought back the remaining 74), Master said.As dusk descends on the barren and hilly landscape, dim lights powered by solar panels donated by NGOs and govt twinkle in the cluster of huts spread across the valley. On Monday, voters from these hamlets will cast their votes yet again with the same hope - electricity.","Bhadal village, from where Binikibai hails, is a place where promises of progress are made every five years but never kept.

"INDIA bloc allies back Kejriwal guarantees, Congress keeps mum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-allies-back-kejriwal-guarantees-congress-keeps-mum/articleshow/110061210.cms,"Congress opted for a cautious approach on Sunday, refraining from making any remarks on AAP national convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal ’s 10 guarantees of INDIA bloc , which received endorsements from allies like Shiv Sena , DMK , TMC, and JMM.Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said AAP’s guarantees are akin to the latter’s manifesto , much like Congress’s Nyay Patra.He declined to comment on the process of arriving at a common agenda, saying: “This is a matter the national leadership will take a call going forward. As of now, we are focussing on the campaign as alliance partners.”CPM Kerala secretary MV Govindan emphasised the bloc’s focus on defeating BJP and deferred further discussions on a common minimum programme until after Lok Sabha election results.DMK highlighted the distinct priorities outlined in each party’s manifesto. “Most of the guarantees made by Kejriwal such as electricity and health are state subjects. They can be implemented only by states. Unlike BJP govt, if GST compensation is increased for states by future govts, states can implement their own welfare measures,” DMK spokesman TKS Elangovan said.CPI general secretary D Raja viewed AAP’s guarantees as the latter’s manifesto, indicating that consultations with allies were unnecessary as each party has its own manifestos. “We too have our manifesto, in which we talk of issues ranging from livelihood, education, health…All INDIA bloc members will come together and draw a common minimum programme after we win and form govt,” he said.Shiv Sena (UBT) spokesperson Anand Dubey, while welcoming the 10 guarantees, said: “Kejriwal is fighting in Delhi and Punjab. So, these guarantees apply especially for those regions. But Kejriwal does what he says, these are all real guarantees. That is why BJP is scared of him and put him in jail. We are 100% with AAP…the entire INDIA bloc is with him. We fully support him on issues like full statehood for Delhi.”According to Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien, the consensus among the people of India is clear: Modi’s guarantees have proven ineffective.JMM in Jharkhand supported the Delhi CM’s guarantees. Party general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said: “We are of the same view of Kejriwal’s assurances. However, all these promises have been made by Congress in its election manifesto.”Lalu Prasad’s RJD declared that most of AAP’s “10 commitments” are already a part of their manifestos. “It’s the duty of every govt to free Indian land from Chinese control. For example, Amit Shah too is talking about taking back PoK,” RJD vice president Shivanand Tiwari said.","Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said AAP’s guarantees are akin to the latter's manifesto.

"Raj Thackeray tears into UBT, NCP over leader poaching",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raj-thackeray-tears-into-ubt-ncp-over-leader-poaching/articleshow/110061027.cms,"THANE: MNS chief Raj Thackeray accused UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar of having started poaching leaders much before rebellions split their respective parties in the last two years.Thackeray was in Kalwa, Sunday, campaigning for Mahayuti candidates for Thane and Kalyan Lok Sabha seats- Naresh Mhaske and Dr Shrikant Shinde.Incidentally, he was addressing Sainiks for the first time in the metropolitan region after his exit from the Sena in 2005.Thackeray pointed how the Uddhav-led Sena had previously poached into his corporators after the BMC polls and also accused Pawar of triggering split in the Congress earlier.Commenting on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he expressed concern that the political parties had no proper agenda unlike the previous elections and probably that’s why they were targeting each other’s families.He further accused his cousin of moving away from Balasaheb’s ideologies for the sake of power. He also sought to know how come a woman (Sushama Andhare) who had made some uncharitable statements about Balasaheb was elevated in the UBT and also questioned how come Uddhav shared power with Chaggan Bhujbal who had attempted to jail Balasaheb.""People voted them (Sena-BJP) to power but after the results, Uddhav suddenly changed his stance seeing an opportunity. He later claimed there was a closed door discussion but why did he remain silent for so long and strated bargaining after the results… Suppose, if the BJP had agreed to his demand, would he (Uddhav) have behaved in the same manner. It is as if the votes and the efforts of voters were wasted,"" Raj said.Thackeray raked up the dormant migrant influx issue and expressed concern how Thane district was rapidly witnessing a population explosion. “Thane probably is the only district in the world to witness such a growth and it has so many municipal bodies operating. The native taxpayers are facing burden due to influx of migrants here. No amount of infrastructure will be adequate unless a solution is worked out...,"" he urged Dr Shinde and Mhaske.He also touched the issue of how several accused of anti-social activities - most of who - were found to have been staying prominently in the suburb of Mumbra.The MNS chief who earlier visited the office cum residence of late Shiv Sena leader Anand Dighe at Tembhi naka didn’t forget to remind the assembled Sainiks and Mahayuti activists about his special bonding with Dighe and his Thane tours.","Thackeray was in Kalwa, Sunday, campaigning for Mahayuti candidates for Thane and Kalyan Lok Sabha seats- Naresh Mhaske and Dr Shrikant Shinde.

Will EC issue orders or advisories to BJP & Congress over MCC violations by 'star campaigners'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-ec-issue-orders-or-advisories-to-bjp-congress-over-mcc-violations-by-star-campaigners/articleshow/110060912.cms,"NEW DELHI: Will the Election Commission issue orders or fresh advisories to BJP and Congress over allegations of some of their “star campaigners” violating the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)? While sources said the EC may act anytime this week, it’s waiting for replies from BJP to its notice.Repeated attempts and queries to get a response from EC spokespersons in the past four days on whether BJP had sought more time and whether the poll panel has allowed this went unanswered till Sunday evening.Congress replied to EC’s notice last week.Sources said the BJP has sought time till Tuesday to submit its response.With 96 parliamentary constituencies going for polls on Monday (today), the voting for more than two-third of all seats will be over and each of all next three phases will have a lesser number of seats.Former EC officials TOI talked to admitted that the poll panel should have acted by now considering that the notices to chiefs of the two national parties were sent on April 25. Both the political parties got enough time to respond and the poll panel to act. “Any action or advisory by EC has its importance and sends a strong message to all party leaders and candidates,” said one of them.Setting a new trend, to make party presidents accountable for alleged violation of MCC by their candidates andstar campaigners , the poll panel had sent notices to BJP chief J P Nadda and Congress head Mallikarjun Kharge seeking their responses to alleged violations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. The EC had sought replies by Apr 29, but both the parties had sought more time to respond.The EC had acted after getting complaints from rival political parties mentioning their objectionable speeches during the poll campaign campaign.The poll panel had said that political parties need to take primary and increasing responsibility for the conduct of their candidates in general and star campaigners while “star campaigner would continue to remain responsible for speeches made”.","EC may act anytime this week, it's waiting for replies from BJP to its notice.
