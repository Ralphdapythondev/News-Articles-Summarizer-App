PM Modi takes oath for 3rd time: Politics behind the Cabinet picks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-takes-oath-for-3rd-time-politics-behind-the-cabinet-picks/articleshow/110857733.cms,"1. BJP is boss:

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru ’s record of three straight terms in the top office. With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculation, he had little difficulty in putting together the council of ministers despite leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD (U), in particular, chose not to haggle, as was generally expected after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Key messages from Modi’s first coalition government :Short of a majority, needing allies , Modi chose to signal the new govt is still his govt, not one created by bargain-hunting allies. Not just the top cabinet jobs — home, ﬁnance, defence, foreign affairs — BJP will likely retain most heavyweight ministries.One reason TDP and JDU didn’t push a hard bargain was that Naidu and Nitish decided ﬁghts with BJP over ministries weren’t worth it if in return they can extract more govt cash for their states, even if Bihar, Andhra don’t get special category status.At least to begin with, allies going along with BJP’s dominance of key jobs means the govt can function without too many disruptions and policy reversals typical of other coalition regimes.Of course, PMO will call the shots. But the inclusion of six former chief ministers will bring administrative and policymaking experience to the council of ministers, especially since several of them have helmed big, complicated states.Three states —Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand — face polls this year. Ministers from Haryana signal BJP intends to stay with the same social engineering formula that helped it build a non-Jat coalition. That Praful Patel’s comments on not taking up a ministerial post were made in the presence of BJP netas reﬂects NDA’s keenness to keep the Maharashtra alliance intact. And picks from Jharkhand point to BJP’s strategy of shoring up non-tribal groups.Modi’s third govt will begin with not a single Muslim minister. This may change later. But as of now, a council of ministers without any Muslims may be read by some in the context of the community’s near-total support for the opposition in the elections.That Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani were both among invitees shows Modi isn’t keeping these billionaires away just because the opposition made ‘crony capitalism’ a big campaign theme. And the sizeable presence of Hindu civil society groups means concessions, if any, on BJP’s core Hindutva agenda will be minor.","With 72 members including him, Modi’s latest team is bigger than the previous two.

A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

Modi government 3.0: Allies get 15% of cabinet berths; upper caste numbers at a low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-3-0-allies-get-15-of-cabinet-berths-upper-caste-numbers-at-a-low/articleshow/110854567.cms,"Narendra Modi Takes Oath As India's Prime Minister For Historic Third Consecutive Term

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi was, on Sunday, sworn in as prime minister for the third time, equalling Jawaharlal Nehru’s record of three straight terms in the top office.With 71 members, his latest team is bigger than the previous two, and, contrary to speculations, he had little difficulty in putting the council of ministers , despitre leading a coalition govt. TDP and JD(U), in particular, chose not to be difficult as was speculated after voters denied BJP an absolute majority.Although portfolios have not been announced, the ease of ministry making is being seen as an indication that BJP may not have difficulty in retaining important ministries, not just home, defence, finance and external affairs, but also others crucial for ensuring continuity of policy trajectory.The exercise was marked by the inclusion of experienced players, including four former CMs, but wasn’t marked by high-wattage exclusions. The govt has seven former CMs, including Modi, and four who have been BJP chiefs.In terms of social composition, it carries forward the process of earmarking a progressively bigger share to ""non-reserved"" categories — SCs/STs and OBCs. The drop in strength of the ""general category contingent"" appears starker. It could paetly be thanks to many heavyweights losing in UP and Bihar. But the messaging from lower upper caste representation is significant in view of the losses BJP suffered because of the opposition's allegation that it was out to scrap quotas.There is a deviation also from the trend of progressively higher share for women, the departure setting off the buzz on early action on women's quota in legislatures. There are six women in the council with Nirmala Sitharaman and Annapurna Devi, who got a promotion, designated cabinet ministers.More striking, however, is the non-representation of Muslims; it is the first instance of a central govt taking office without any representative of the largest minority community on board.Including the 30 members with cabinet rank, it is the largest council of ministers since 2014, the increase resulting from the need to accommodate 11 from among BJP allies . J P Nadda, who will soon complete his tenure as BJP president, made a comeback in govt, paving the way for an organisational recast. Nadda’s entry also meant that Anurag Singh Thakur, MP from Hamirpur in Himachal, missed out, but is likely to get a prominent party post. Dharmendra Pradhan’s inclusion in the Union cabinet for the third straight time is a confirmation that the party will look for a legislator from Odisha to be sworn in as chief minister on Monday. Pradhan had looked the obvious frontrunner for the post in Bhubaneswar.Apart from BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal, former CMs of MP and Haryana respectively, the govt also boasts of two other former CMs in H D Kumaraswamy (JDS) and Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM) to add to the bench strength. Among prominent allies, NCP opted out of the cabinet, at least for the time being, with its representative, former cabinet minister Praful Patel, publicly saying the offer of MoS was not acceptable to him because it would have meant a demotion.Overall, there were 33 first-time ministers, with seven of them from alliance partners, including TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandra Shekhar Pemmasani, JD(U)'s Lallan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary, LJP’s Chirag Paswan and Kumaraswamy from JD(S). Naidu is the youngest cabinet minister at 36 years.The PM sought to strike a regional balance, while ensuring that states such as Maharashtra and Haryana, where elections are due, get adequate representation. Despite electoral setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, the state retains its primacy in terms of representation with 11 ministers, followed by Bihar (eight), Maharashtra and Gujarat (six each).The party think tank has also opted to go with those who have won their Lok Sabha seats, ignoring the claims of several candidates who lost the election, with Ravneet Singh ‘Bittu’ and L Murugan being exceptions. Murugan is the only member from Modi’s team from the previous term who has found a berth despite losing the election.Rajnath Singh (Lucknow), Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (Jodhpur), Jitendra Singh (Udhampur) and Kirti Vardhan Singh (Gonda) are the four ministers from Thakur community, which had a far bigger representation from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in first two terms of Modi govt.","With 71 members, his latest team is bigger than the previous two.

Mix of old hands and new faces

Full list of the new council of ministers:

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the oath of office for a historic third consecutive term at 7.15pm on Sunday along with his council of ministers in an over 3-hour-long grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan .As per media reports, the new Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Monday evening at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence.Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony , PM Modi had hosted a high tea for the 71 would-be council of ministers (which include 30 Cabinet ministers, 5 Ministers of State-Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of State). The portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups. It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities. A record 18 senior Ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.The first-timers from the BJP are Kamlesh Paswan (Uttar Pradesh), Sukanta Majumder (West Bengal), Durga Das Uikey (Madhya Pradesh), Raj Bhushan Chaudhary (Bihar), Satish Dubey (Bihar), Sanjay Seth (Jharkhand), C R Paatil (Gujarat), Bhagirath Chaudhary (Rajasthan), Harsh Malhotra (Delhi), V Somanna (Karnataka), Savitri Thakur (UP). Kamaljeet Sehrawat (Delhi), Prataprao Jadhav (Maharashtra), George Kurian (Kerala), Kirti Vardhan Singh (UP), Tokhan Sahu (Chhattisgarh), Bhupathi Raju Srinivasa Varma (Andhra Pradesh), Nimuben Bambhniya (Gujarat), Murlidhar Mohol (Maharashtra), Pabitra Margherita (Assam) and Bandi Sanjay Kumar (Telangana), are also among the BJP first-timers.BJP's NDA partners have got five cabinet ministerial berths in the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as against none in the outgoing government, given the party's dependence on allies for a majority in the Lok Sabha. While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs. The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unanimously passed a resolution to elect Narendra Modi as their leader on June 5.Several leaders and State heads of neighbourhood region and Indian Ocean region were invited for PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony as distinguished guests.After the last reshuffling of portfolios in the previous Modi government, the council of ministers had comprised the PM and 78 ministers, including 29 Cabinet Ministers, 3 Ministers of State (Independent Charge) and 47 Ministers of State.","PM Narendra Modi takes oath of office for historic third consecutive term, equals Jawaharlal Nehru's record.

Jammu pilgrim bus attack suggests new areas on terrorists’ radar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/pilgrims-killed-injured-as-bus-falls-into-gorge-after-terrorist-attack-in-jks-reasi/articleshow/110853516.cms,"JAMMU: At least ten pilgrims were killed and over 30 others injured when their bus plunged into a gorge following a terrorist ambush near Teryath village in Reasi district of J&K around 6pm Sunday, police reported.“The identities of the dead and injured have not yet been confirmed, but it is believed that the pilgrims are from Uttar Pradesh,” Reasi SSP Mohita Sharma said. A survivor named Santosh from UP confirmed that many of the passengers were from his state.The bus was returning from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Katra, a town known for the Vaishno Devi temple. It was travelling on a link road of NH144A, winding through thick forests and mountainous terrain.“Prima facie, it appears terrorists were waiting for the bus,” SSP Sharma said. “The driver was hit by gunfire and lost control of the vehicle,” the officer said, noting that bullet shells were found at the scene. The injured have been taken to hospitals in Teryath, Reasi, and Jammu.Local residents and authorities participated in the rescue operations, while a security sweep involving police, Army, and CRPF personnel was initiated to catch the attackers. The area, located 100km northwest of Jammu, has been cordoned off.Initial reports indicate that two masked terrorists opened fire on the bus, hitting the driver.According to 30-year-old Santosh, currently undergoing treatment in Reasi, a masked terrorist in military-style combat fatigue stood in the middle of the road and fired indiscriminately. “I could hear intermittent gunshots when the bus was rolling down the mountainside,” he said.Union minister Amit Shah condemned the attack and expressed his condolences, tweeting: “Deeply pained by the incident of the attack on pilgrims in Reasi, J&K. Spoke to the Lieutenant Governor and the DGP, J&K, and inquired about the incident. The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law.”Union minister Rajnath Singh called the attack on pilgrims “extremely reprehensible”. “My heart goes out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this heinous act against pilgrims. I also pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,” he tweeted.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi also expressed his condolences to the bereaved families. “This shameful incident is the true picture of the worrying security situation in Jammu and Kashmir,” he tweeted.Sunday’s ambush suggests a spread of terrorist violence to new areas, as Reasi had remained unaffected by the recent spate of attacks in neighbouring Rajouri and Poonch districts. The Pir Panjal route, known for its arduous terrain, is frequently used by terrorists to infiltrate Jammu from the LoC in Poonch and Rajouri before moving towards Kashmir.Sources suspect the involvement of former Pakistani army SSG commando-turned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative Illiyas Fauji and two other terrorists from Pakistan, who have been on the run since the fatal attack on an IAF convoy in Poonch district on May 4.According to Union home ministry data, eight civilians were killed in J&K in the first five months of this year up to May 31.The last terrorist attack in Reasi was on May 13, 2022, when terrorists used “sticky bombs” on a bus carrying pilgrims from Katra to Jammu, resulting in four deaths and injuries to 13 others.Sunday’s attack is reminiscent of the July 10, 2017, assault on a bus carrying Amarnath pilgrims, in which seven were killed and 19 injured. On that occasion, the driver managed to save 52 passengers despite heavy gunfire.","The bus was returning from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Katra, a town known for the Vaishno Devi temple.

New government to decide on Army's integrated battle group plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-government-to-decide-on-armys-integrated-battle-group-plan/articleshow/110854869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Apart from the impending move to create unified tri-Service theatre commands , the new govt will also take a call on the long-pending restructuring of some Army formations into self-contained integrated battle groups (IBGs) that can mobilise fast and hit hard, sources said.The 12-lakh strong Army has already carved out two IBGs under the 9 'Pivot' Corps (headquarters in Yol) on western front with Pakistan under Phase-1 of the 'pilot project'. Five IBGs, in turn, have been created in 17 'Mountain Strike' Corps (Panagarh) in eastern one with China in Phase-2.""These integrated all-arms IBGs have been successfully war-gamed and validated in multiple exercises. Army HQ had earlier submitted the report on Phase-1 of 'IBG-isation' to defence ministry. But MoD has also asked for Phase-2 report before official GSL (government sanction letter) can be issued,"" a source told TOI.Army remains all gung-ho about the role of IBGs, which it believes will ensure a greater and swifter offensive punch. But it remains to be seen how exactly the IBG model dovetails into the three proposed theatre commands to be constituted for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean region.""Theatre commands constitute a strategic-level reform involving Army, IAF and Navy. IBG model is a tactical re-organisation within Army, which has already been delayed quite a bit. But since IBG-isation has some financial implications, a GSL is required,"" another source said.As reported by TOI earlier, a composite IBG will have 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units permanently deployed together. As of now, these units come together only during exercises or actual combat.In effect, much more agile IBGs will be larger than brigades (3,000 soldiers each) but smaller than divisions (12,000 soldiers each) and will be headed by Major-Generals. Each IBG is to be configured as per the threat perception, the type of terrain involved and the operational task to be executed.So, IBGs meant for China will revolve more around infantry, light artillery and light mechanised forces geared for mountain warfare, while those for Pakistan will be focused on main-battle tanks and heavy artillery due to the plains involved.The original plan was to first carve out 8-10 IBGs, then wait for them to settle down, and finally create more over the years. Overall, the Army has 14 corps (40,000 to 70,000 troops in each), with four of them being 'strike' or offensive formations.While the 17 Corps was raised with China in mind, the 1 Corps (Mathura) was also ""reoriented and equipped"" for the northern borders after the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in May 2020. The two Pakistan-specific strike corps are 2 Corps (Ambala) and 21 Corps (Bhopal).","The 12-lakh strong Army has already carved out two IBGs under the 9 'Pivot' Corps on western front with Pakistan under Phase-1 of the 'pilot project' Five IBGs, in turn, have been created in 17 'Mountain Strike' Corps (Panagarh) in eastern one with China in Phase-2.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110855018,imgsize-1770674,width-400,resizemode-4/110855018.jpg"

After the terrorist firing, the bus driver lost control and the bus fell into a gorge,"" said the SSP.In response to the emergency, a rescue operation was promptly initiated, with reinforcements from the police, army, and paramilitary forces rushing to the scene. The combined efforts aim to assist survivors and recover the injured from the difficult terrain.The official said, ""Rescue operations are complete. They (injured) were immediately referred to Naraina and Reasi District hospitals. The passengers were not locals. Their identities were not clear but from initial reports, they belonged to UP.""In response to the tragic incident, a round-the-clock helpline has been established by the District Administration to provide information and assistance to those affected by the accident at Kanda, Ransoo, Reasi.For any information or assistance, the following numbers may be contacted:Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha took to X and said, ""PM Narendra Modi Ji took stock of the situation and has asked me to constantly monitor the situation.

However, it is likely that he may continue as the Home Minister in this government also.Shah said the local administration is working on a war footing to provide immediate medical attention.""May the Almighty give the loved ones of the deceased the strength to bear this pain. I also pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,"" he said.Reacting to the incident, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the attack.

IndiGo plane hits runway even as Air India aircraft was taking off; DGCA orders probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/indigo-plane-hits-runway-even-as-air-india-aircraft-was-taking-off-dgca-orders-probe/articleshow/110854061.cms,"MUMBAI: In a close call at Mumbai airport on Saturday, an IndiGo aircraft descended on the runway, touching down even as an Air India flight was taking off, breaching the safety margin. The Air India plane lifted off a split second before the IndiGo jet touched down about 2,100 feet behind, said sources.At the busy Mumbai airport, which operates with one runway, the norm is that the aircraft taking off should lift off and cross the end of the strip before the aircraft landing can cross the beginning and proceed to touch down.The incident, captured by plane spotters, showed the two aircraft, one behind the other, on the runway. On Sunday, the footage went viral on social media, prompting DGCA to initiate an investigation. From the angle the footage was recorded, the aircraft appeared dangerously close.The investigation will primarily look into the sequence of events that led to the breach of separation, the safety margin, between the two A320Neo aircraft, one operated by AI as AI-657 from Mumbai to Thiruvananthapuram and the other, an IndiGo flight 6E5053 from Indore to Mumbai.The runway meet-up of both these flights occurred around 6.20am. The air traffic controller concerned has been derostered from duty to allow for the investigation.""The AI aircraft was cleared by the air traffic control (ATC) to enter the runway and subsequently cleared for take-off. The AI aircraft continued with the take-off movement in accordance with laid down procedures,"" said AI in a statement.The IndiGo flight from Indore was given landing clearance by ATC, a spokesman for the airline said. ""The pilot in command continued the approach and landing and followed ATC instructions,"" IndiGo said.Though both airlines said their commanders merely followed ATC instructions, pilots and controllers TOI spoke to highlighted the role played by pilots and the system that forces them to operate in a constrained space in heavy traffic.""The domino was triggered by the AI aircraft,"" said air safety expert capt Amit Singh, based on data gathered from Flightradar24. Given the heavy air traffic on the lone runway, aircraft land or take off in a tight, choreographic sequence. The series of events that led to the incident occurred in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the AI aircraft entered the runway for take-off. ""The AI aircraft was slow to take-off after it received the line-up clearance, assuming they received immediate take-off clearance,"" he said. They should have informed ATC, who would have cancelled their take-off clearance.According to the Mumbai airport Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), ""when an aircraft is issued with a take-off clearance after lining up on the runway it shall commence take-off immediately. If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take-off, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.""The AI aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line). AIP also provides rules for landings. ""Aircraft shall not land on an occupied runway even if landing clearance is received,"" says the AIP, listing a commander's responsibility. ""Pilot should not hesitate to ask ATC about traffic on the runway. If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate go around,"" it adds.Captain Singh said: ""The question is the degree of responsibility on each of them, the controller and the two pilots and most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at the Mumbai airport which puts the controllers and pilots in such situations.,"" he added.","Air India plane lifted off a split second before the IndiGo jet touched down about 2,100 feet behind.

"In a first, no Muslim takes oath as minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-no-muslim-takes-oath-as-minister/articleshow/110854291.cms,"NEW DELHI: This is perhaps the first time that no Muslim MP took oath as minister after the election. Interestingly, the outgoing council of ministers did not have a Muslim minister after Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was not re-elected to Rajya Sabha.The composition of the council of ministers sworn in after every general election had at least one Muslim MP in it. In 2014, when PM Narendra Modi took oath for the first time, Najma Heptulla was sworn in and was made minority affairs minister. In 2019, Naqvi was sworn in and he too became minority affairs minister.One of the reasons for no Muslim representation in this council of ministers is that no Muslim candidate from NDA allies got elected to the 18th Lok Sabha. Of the 24 Muslim MPs elected to the lower House, 21 are from the INDIA bloc and the remaining are Asaduddin Owaisi of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and two Independents — Abdul Rashid Sheikh or ‘Engineer Rashid’ and Mohmad Haneefa from J&K.The council of ministers of 2004 and 2009 had four and five Muslim MPs respectively. Even in 1999, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee govt had two Muslims in the council of ministers — Shahnawaz Hussain and Omar Abdullah.

BHUBANESWAR: V K Pandian , who quit the IAS last November to join BJD and quickly graduated from ex-CM Naveen Patnaik's trusted bureaucratic aide to rumoured political heir, ended his innings in politics just as swiftly on Sunday with a statement saying he was ""sorry if the campaign narrative against me has had a part to play for BJD's loss"".""I have consciously decided to withdraw myself from active politics...I apologise to the Biju family and all workers of BJD. My only intent of joining politics was to assist my mentor Naveen Patnaik,"" said Pandian, who had declared at a rally that he would quit politics if BJD didn't return to office with a three-fourths majority.Tamil Nadu-born Pandian's resignation caps a week of setbacks for BJD, with Naveen missing out on a sixth consecutive term in office and the party drawing a blank in the Lok Sabha poll. The former bureaucrat, whom BJP repeatedly targeted during the campaign as a threat to ""Odia asmita"" (identity), is copping much of the blame for his party's electoral debacle, although his mentor has stood by him.In what could be more than a coincidence, Naveen's nephew Arun Patnaik landed in Bhubaneswar on Saturday, sparking a buzz about the BJD baton being passed within the family. Naveen recently clarified that he hadn't anointed Pandian as his political successor, saying the people of Odisha would choose who should wear that hat.Pandian joined politics on November 27 last year, a month after taking voluntary retirement from the IAS. He would go on to play the lead role in BJD's campaign amid allegations that Naveen had left all crucial decisions to him.Pockets of resistance to Pandian getting precedence within BJD over those from the state played a role in the party's strength in the 147-member assembly dwindling to 51. BJP won 78 seats.In a four-minute video, his first since the June 4 poll verdict, Pandian appeared to accept responsibility for BJD's dismal show.","V K Pandian quit the IAS last November to join BJD and quickly graduated from trusted bureaucratic aide to rumoured political heir.

While Ajit Pawar and Patel have accepted NDA's contention, they have decided ""to wait till remedial measures are taken as early as possible.""After a meeting with BJP president J P Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh late on Saturday, NCP was informed there's only one one minister of state (MoS) post on offer for smaller parties, barring N Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United).In view of his seniority, NCP was expecting that Patel would be granted a plum portfolio with cabinet rank. Patel said: ""We were informed that NCP will get MoS with independent charge. I was earlier a cabinet minister in the Union government, so this would be a demotion for me. I had reservations on accepting the MoS post. We informed the BJP leadership and they told us to wait for a few days and they would take remedial measures.""Pawar, who attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi along with state NCP president Sunil Tatkare, said, ""Patel is a senior leader and has already held the post of MoS earlier. We have made it clear that either NCP gets a cabinet berth or we wait (till it becomes available). But we shall continue to support the NDA, there's no question of us leaving the alliance.""Pawar said that during his meeting with Nadda, Singh and Shah in the presence of Patel and state NCP president Sunil Tatkare, he pointed out that currently NCP has two MPs - one each in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha - but in the months to come, its strength will increase to four, with the possibility of two additional RS members. ""Under such circumstances, I argued NCP's case for a cabinet berth. I also explained to the BJP leadership that Patel is a senior cabinet member ... Under such circumstances, if NCP is given MoS post, it would be a great injustice...not appropriate. When the BJP leadership told us that NCP will have to wait for a cabinet rank, we agreed accordingly,"" he added.In the Lok Sabha polls, NCP managed to win just one seat - Tatkare wresting the Raigad seat - of the four it contested from. Following whispers that NCP was unhappy, deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday rushed to Tatkare's residence where Patel and Pawar were already present. ""Certain situations are to be accepted in coalition politics. The BJP leadership has taken certain decisions on the constitution of the cabinet for the partners. At his juncture, it will not be possible for us to change the formula for one ally. I am sure the NCP has understood the situation.

"Modi 3.0 cabinet: BJP train rolls on, with berths for allies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-3-0-cabinet-bjp-train-rolls-on-with-berths-for-allies/articleshow/110854352.cms,"NEW DELHI: The latest exercise of ministry-making, like all its previous editions, had its share of surprise inclusions and exclusions, though on closer examination, some of those did not seem to be as puzzling as they initially seemed.Take the case of Jagat Prakash Nadda. Though he was sure to be suitably accommodated after the end of his extended tenure as BJP chief later this month, few had sensed his return to the cabinet on Sunday.The ""surprise"", however, did help dissipate the ""mystery"" about the exclusion of outgoing I&B minister Anurag Singh Thakur who scored his fifth consecutive victory from Hamirpur, the logic being that the tiny state of Himachal Pradesh, with four Lok Sabha seats, cannot be assigned two important cabinet berths .Ditto for JD(U)'s Sanjay Jha. Easily the most trusted of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's lieutenants at this time, he, along with his friends in BJP, was instrumental in the rapprochement with the saffron party - an endeavour for which he was once publicly heckled. He was seen as a shoo-in. But the surprise factor wears thin in the light of the ""one cabinet, one MoS"" cap BJP insisted on in the case of TDP and JD(U). This helped Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lalan', who is senior in JD(U) and whose ties with Nitish remain strong despite their rollercoaster pattern.Ravishankar Prasad's failure to return to the cabinet also engaged the attention of many. In his case, there were no ready answers available. Although he was dropped midway through the last term, he would be consistently fielded by the party as spokesperson on important issues and during high-intensity skirmishes. He was also given a ticket in defiance of intense lobbying. The compulsion to take along the allies, whose support will be crucial in next year's state polls, can be the only possible explanation for the omission.Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who was also dropped midway through the last tenure, has failed to make a return despite succeeding yet against against the formidable Lalu Prasad clan in Saran - something which became a topic of discussion because, after the defeat of power minister R K Singh, as well as a few others in the neighbouring region of UP, there were not too many strong claimants from the Rajput community.George Kurian, only the second person after Ravneet Singh Bittu to have been brought in despite not being a member of either of the two Houses, looks like a wild card entry. But when seen along with the success of, and reward for, Suresh Gopi, the party's maiden winner in Kerala, the choice may not look that intriguing. Gopi's success was facilitated by significant support from the Christian community and the party could be hoping to expand the opening with Kurian.Bittu's inclusion and the retention of Hardeep Singh Puri also appears to be an extension of the PM's reachout to Sikhs and his decision not to abandon the bridge building effort despite rebuffs.Choice of Harsh Malhotra, the winner from East Delhi, came at the cost of Manoj Tiwari. The winner from North-East Delhi for the third straight time had appeared to be a certainty, considering that he was the only one from among the winners of the last time who had been retained in the Capital.Contrary to the widely held estimate, BJP's media cell head and the winner from Garhwal, Anil Baluni, who enjoys the goodwill of the leadership, also could not make it.","Few had sensed Jagat Prakash Nadda's return to the cabinet on Sunday.

The first was former Amalapuram MP Ganti Mohana Chandra Balayogi, who died in a helicopter crash in 2002.Sources said BJP believes that elevating Purandeswari to LS Speaker will also be received well by Telugu Desam Party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister-designate N Chandrababu Naidu . Notably, Naidu’s wife and Purandeswari are sisters.As a three-time MP and current Andhra BJP chief, Purandeswari played a pivotal role in BJP’s alliance with TDP and Jana Sena in Andhra Pradesh in the 2024 election. This alliance yielded impressive results, with the NDA winning 164 out of 175 assembly seats in the state. Moreover, the alliance boasts 21 MPs in Andhra Pradesh — 16 from TDP, three from BJP, and two from Jana Sena. TDP emerged as the second-largest party in the NDA alliance, after BJP.Prior to being elected MP from Rajahmundry in the just concluded polls, Purandeswari served as MP for Bapatla and Visakhapatnam in 2004 and 2009, respectively. She emerged as the right choice for the position of Andhra Pradesh BJP chief when the party was struggling to establish a foothold in Andhra Pradesh.She led the party to tremendous success, with eight MLAs (out of the 10 contested seats) and three MPs (out of the six contested LS seats) in the recently held election.An eloquent speaker, Purandeswari enjoys a positive image among different sections of society and political parties in Andhra Pradesh.",Daggubati Purandeswari is among the probables for the post of Speaker in the 18th Lok Sabha.

Annamalai-Tamilisai rift widens in Tamil Nadu BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/annamalai-tamilisai-rift-widens-in-tn-bjp/articleshow/110854616.cms,"The rift between K Annamalai and Tamilisai Soundararajan , current and former Tamil Nadu BJP chiefs, respectively, widened Sunday with their supporters indulging in social-media mudslinging in the wake of the party’s poll debacle in the state, reports Yazh Iniyan. Both Annamalai and Tamilisai lost as LS candidates.State general secretary of BJP OBC Morcha Tiruchi Suriyaa Siva hit back at Soundararajan for her comments earlier that “anti-social elements” were inducted into the party. “It was during the presidency of L Murugan, who was appointed on your recommendation, people with criminal backgrounds were inducted... I can produce a list of such names,” Siva said. This led to volleys from both sides. Those criticising Annamalai blamed him for BJP’s loss. Annamalai’s supporters defended him saying there was a rise in BJP’s vote share. They also slammed Tamilisai for discussing party affairs in public.The issue started when former BJP intellectual wing functionary Kalyaan Raman started attacking Annamalai. Kalyanaraman had pointed out that BJP’s vote share in 2024, after contesting 23 seats was lesser than in 2014, when the party contested only nine seats.Tamilisai also agreed to former AIADMK minister S P Velumani’s view that BJP-AIADMK front could have won upto 35 seats if the alliance had continued. This did not go down well with Annamalai’s supporters.Even as supporters of Annamalai started targeting Kalyaan Raman, Tamilisai’s interview for a Tamil media house, in which she indirectly took a dig at the BJP chief, trig gered fresh controversy.Sharing that video of Tamilisai, Suriyaa Siva alleged that her interview showed that she was not able to tolerate the growth of ‘an individual’ in the state.“When you were the president, there were none to join BJP in Tamil Nadu,” he charged.Kalyaan Raman came to the defense of Tamilisai in yet another social media post. “Do you know anything about her contribution to TN BJP,” he asked a right wing functionary who criticised her.While the national high command was occupied with the swearing-in ceremony, other senior leaders in TN BJP chose to maintain silence over the rift.BJP spokesperson A N S Prasad defended supporters of Annamalai saying that controversy was created on purpose to defame the party. “ Kalyaan Raman is no longer part of the party and there is no truth in his words. Annamalai worked hard for the party’s growth in Tamil Nadu. Because of his hard work, today, BJP is a formidable political force in the state,” said Prasad.",The rift between K Annamalai and Tamilisai Soundararajan widened Sunday with their supporters indulging in social-media mudslinging in the wake of the party's poll debacle in the state.

Gen Z teens 'coming out' younger with stronger family support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gen-z-teens-coming-out-younger-with-stronger-family-support/articleshow/110854590.cms,"*Names changed for privacy

Manav* was a typical 14-year-old boy-moody, defiant, with hormones in overdrive and attitude on the rise, when he decided to add the declaration of - ""I'm bisexual "" - to the mix. Initially his parents were taken aback. ""Although my parents are aware of queerness and supportive of the community, it did come as a shock. I used to be moody during those days and they knew something was up but hadn't quite predicted it was going to be this."" Yet, despite their initial confusion and apprehensions, they rallied around him. ""They've been supportive and more careful with their comments now.""For many queer individuals in India, the social pressure of 'coming out' - a metaphor used by LGBTQ+ persons to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity to friends and family - is already daunting. But Manav's decision to open up to his parents at 14 is just one example of a growing phenomenon of teenagers bravely owning their identities as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender while still a middle grader. What is remarkable is how families and schools are stepping up to guide them through this phase and find acceptance in ways that were once unthinkable.Now 16, Manav's realisation of his queer identity began as he entered his teens. ""I was around 13 or 14 when I started getting drawn to queer literature,"" he recalls. ""The more I read, the more I could relate to queer love stories than heteronormative ones.""A family vacation to Turkey further intensified his feelings. It was June, and the street was buzzing with a Pride Parade. ""Seeing the parade and a subsequent police crackdown was a reality check,"" recalls Manav. ""I felt solidarity with the community."" He says it ""sparked deeper introspection"" and a need to share his truth.Back at home, Manav summoned the courage to come out to his parents and a year later, to most of his friends at school. ""My parents had some questions at first,"" he recounts. ""There were misunderstandings, too, mainly because they weren't fully informed. They also worried about how others would react. But it's been a positive transition for both of us since then."" Coming out to friends had its challenges - ""I faced online bullying, with anonymous hateful comments on my Instagram stories which I learned to shrug off"" - but brought unexpected rewards. ""I've made new friends and moved into new social circles because of my gender identity."" While concrete data on whether kids are self-identifying earlier is scarce, speaking to schools, counsellors, and support groups reveals that teens and, in many cases, preteens as young as six are expressing their gender identity without being dismissed by parents or ridiculed at school.Several social factors may be contributing to this early expression, educators believe. Positive queer portrayals in popular culture have made it safer for young students to open up about their feelings, points out Aachal Jain, pastoral care coordinator at Mumbai's Aditya Birla World Academy (ABWA). ""Students often explore their identities online or through creative outlets before coming out. They can also find a wealth of resources on the subject today, which likely leads them to self-identify and come out earlier,"" she explains.""It's no longer a taboo subject at home, nor in school. I know many like me who felt safe and comfortable coming out to their friends and family at 14 or 15,"" adds Manav, who found solace in his school environment, at Delhi's Tagore International School particularly through Breaking Barriers, a club and support group for the LGBTQ community.Priyanka Randhawa, the project director at Tagore International, knows that discussing identity with family isn't always smooth sailing. ""Sometimes, it's during our outreach activities that they feel comfortable opening up,"" she shares. She encourages students to reflect on what feels right for them personally. ""When students want to dive deeper into their identities, we connect them with LGBTQ support groups and counsellors to ensure their journey is genuine, not just about fitting in or being 'trendy'.""As counsellor and founder of ABWA's Rainbow Club, Jain challenges the idea that coming out as queer is about fitting in or being cool. ""It comes with a lot of backlash and bullying,"" she explains. ""Teenagers may not always have the words to define their feelings, but they know when they're different and are very aware of how the world sees them. It takes real courage to attach a label to themselves.""Jain has observed more 15 and 16-year-olds opening up during their sessions, confidently identifying as gay, demigirl, or pansexual. ""We also had a student who, at 13, revealed herself as bi and later identified as asexual when she was passing out of school. That's how fluid these identities can be,"" Jain explains. ""The key is acceptance - recognising that whatever they're feeling is valid.""Stressing the importance of early parental support, Jain shares a recent case of a six-year-old boy whose parents reached out to her. He wanted to wear lipstick and skirts, and his parents sought advice-not to ""fix"" him, but to create a more gender-neutral environment at home. ""They wanted to help him explore his identity without facing bullying and without negating his feelings,"" she explains. ""Parents making these efforts marks a positive shift.""","A growing number of teens in India are coming out as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.

HC rejects terror convict’s plea for 2 sentences to run together,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-rejects-terror-convicts-plea-for-2-sentences-to-run-together/articleshow/110854349.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that terrorism must be dealt with sternly, Delhi HC has rejected the plea of a terror convict seeking merging of two sentences in two different cases.The petitioner pleaded that since he had voluntarily pleaded guilty in both cases, HC should allow his seven-year sentence in a UAPA case for conspiring to establish an IS base in India run “concurrently” with the sentence imposed upon him in another case, wherein he conspired to carry out an attack in Haridwar during the Ardh Kumbh Mela and raised funds for the same. The petitioner said he was a young, poor and illiterate man who had a genuine desire to reform himself, obtain an education and become a productive member of society.Dismissing the petition, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma emphasised that the offence committed by petitioner Mohsin Ibrahim Sayyed was grave and had impacted national security and communal harmony. “Terrorism not only threatens the national security of the country but also the very fabric of society by targeting innocent civilians and institutions indiscriminately, with an aim to instil fear among the common and innocent citizens of a country,” the court noted in a recent order. “They also result in loss of innocent lives, destruction of property and destabilisation of regions. These impacts are often long-lasting. Thus, the gravity of such crimes lies in their potential to cause widespread harm, both physically and psychologically, and their challenge to fundamental values of peace, tolerance and coexistence in a nation,” it stated.“Since a lenient view has already been taken by trial courts at the stage of sentencing , no further leniency can be granted to the petitioner by allowing concurrent running of sentences... ,” it concluded.","Delhi HC rejects plea of terror convict seeking merging of two sentences in two different cases.

He was Union home minister from 2014-2019 and defence minister from 2019 onwards. It is speculated that he will continue with his existing portfolio.Popularly known as 'Mama', Chouhan was MP CM four times before he was replaced by Mohan Yadav after the state polls recently.The first BJP CM in Haryana, Manohar Lal resigned in March in the final months of his second tenure, paving the way for party colleague Nayab Singh Saini to take over. He won the Lok Sabha polls from Karnal and his inclusion was expected.The first BJP CM of Assam, Sonowal made way for Himanta Biswa Sarma in 2021 although the party had won the state polls under his leadership. Kumaraswamy, whose father H D Deve Gowda is an ex-PM, won from Mandya.

Amaravati works restart on Naidu nudge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amaravati-works-restart-on-naidu-nudge/articleshow/110854264.cms,"VIJAYAWADA : Andhra Pradesh authorities have swung into action on new capital Amaravati, restarting and speeding up projects after sensing the priorities of the incoming TDP-led NDA govt , reports Srikanth Aluri .

Chief secretary Neerab Kumar made a surprise visit to Amaravati on Sunday and said CM-designate N Chandrababu Naidu had given instructions to fast-track the projects. Amaravati had been a signature initiative of Naidu in his previous term till he was unseated by YSRCP in 2018.

The plan took a further hit after outgoing CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy announced in 2019 a proposal to develop three capitals, puncturing the euphoria around Amaravati and leaving projects idle.He said works would start after the swearing-in ceremony expected later this week.

"India, Pakistan may hold Indus talks this month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pak-may-hold-indus-talks-this-month/articleshow/110854226.cms,"NEW DELHI: India may host a Pakistan delegation this month for a meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) that looks to resolve bilateral issues through dialogue under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan was a notable omission, along with Myanmar, in the Modi 3.0 inauguration guest list that included most other immediate neighbours but the World Bank-backed Indus talks remain ring-fenced from the turbulent nature of ties which have been bereft of any substantive diplomatic engagement in the past 8 years.The 2 countries are currently in touch to finalise the dates for the proposed visit in the third week of this month. Under the 1960 IWT, the 2 sides are required to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. India refuses to engage Pakistan otherwise because of the latter’s support to cross-border terrorism .If the visit happens, the delegation may also travel to J&K for talks related to IWT, which provides a framework for irrigation and hydropower development, allocating the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India. As the World Bank says, the Treaty also allows each country certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other.There was a renewed interest in IWT talks last year after India gave a notice to Pakistan for a modification of the Treaty because of the latter’s “intransigence and unilateral actions” on the issue of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in J&K. India was upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way, instead of seeking separate processes, to address Pakistan's objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue.The World Bank, which is also a signatory to IWT, in October 2022 appointed not just a neutral expert to examine the issue but also, at Pakistan's insistence, a Court of Arbitration chairman, despite acknowledging India's concern that carrying out the two processes concurrently posed practical and legal challenges. The court, which Pakistan claims has been set up under IWT provisions, has been hearing the case in The Hague but India hasn’t participated in it saying this court was illegally constituted.India has instead focused on the meetings convened by the Neutral Expert appointed on India’s request under the aegis of the Treaty. Pakistan too attended the meeting in September last year.","The 2 countries are currently in touch to finalise the dates for the proposed visit in the third week of this month.
