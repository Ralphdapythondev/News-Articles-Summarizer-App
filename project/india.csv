IT Act

relief for social media intermediaries'

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that mere viewing of child pornographic material on the internet is also an offence under Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and provisions of Information Technology Act, thus considerably expanding the scope of the two laws through purposive interpretation.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala said, ""Any act of viewing, distributing or displaying of any child pornographic material...over the internet without any actual or physical possession or storage of such material in any device or in any form or manner would also amount to 'possession' in terms of Sec 15 of Pocso Act .""The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' to set aside an ""egregiously erroneous"" order of Madras HC, which quashed a Pocso case against a porn-addict, saying he had not circulated it.In a significant step to check proliferation of child porn on the internet, SC Monday said social media intermediaries cannot claim exemption, or 'safe harbour', under IT Act without deleting such offensive videos, images and reporting about this to police as per Pocso Act mandate.Section 79 of IT Act provides 'safe harbour' to intermediaries, that is non-liability for third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by them, if they follow the prescribed due diligence. Pocso Act places an obligation on them to not only report offences thereunder but hand over material, including source from which such material originated, to the special juvenile police unit or the local police or cyber crime portal.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala referred to a MoU between National Crime Records Bureau under home ministry and National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US-based NGO, which requires all social media intermediaries to report cases of child abuse and exploitation to NCMEC for forwarding it to state police concerned for necessary action.The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities as mandated under Pocso Act. ""An intermediary cannot claim exemption from liability under Section 79 of IT Act for any third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by it, unless due diligence is conducted by it and compliance is made of these provisions of Pocso Act,"" the bench said.""Social media intermediaries, in addition to reporting the commission or the likely apprehension of commission of any offence under Pocso Act to NCMEC is also obligated to report the same to authorities specified under Section 19 of Pocso Act, ie special juvenile police unit or local police,"" it said.The bench cautioned courts against showing any leniency or leeway in offences under Section 21 of Pocso Act, ""particularly to schools/educational institutions, special homes, children's homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails etc who failed to discharge their obligation of reporting the commission or apprehension of commission of any offence or instance of child abuse or exploitation under Pocso Act"".",The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

MUMBAI: Tensions rose in Dharavi after a large number of residents gathered on the streets to protest against the BMC 's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque on the 90 ft road, forcing the civic team to discontinue the action on Saturday.Police registered a case after stones were pelted at a BMC vehicle . As a precautionary measure, police have deployed heavy bandobast in the area.A large crowd gathered to protest the BMC action at around 9 am.Subsequently, according to the BMC, after trustees of the mosque sought a period of four to five days to remove the encroached construction on their own, the BMC gave them that deadline. According to the civic body, an eviction notice was earlier served on the mosque and action was initiated as per the notice.The G-North ward had initiated action to carry out demolition of unauthorised parts of the mosque twice this year, the latest on Sept 5, but the action was stopped at the last moment on both occasions. Action was stopped in Jan due to instructions from top authorities.Political activists questioned the BMC action and claimed some repairs have been carried out for the safety of the structure and BMC has no right to now demolish the structure as the DRP ( Dharavi redevelopment project) has come into being and the mosque had a photo pass.""The police were not prepared, and they told us the situation could slip out of hands and result in violence. Meanwhile, the trustees too agreed to demolish the unauthorised construction on their own and sought more time,"" said a BMC official.Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis said those in-charge of the mosque have informed BMC they would remove the construction. ""There are past high court orders in this case. BMC in the past had initiated demolition action but mosque authorities had requested action be delayed till after Eid. This morning, when the BMC team reached the site for demolition, they were given a written assurance that the construction will be removed in 3-4 days.

In Kangan, tribals voted for the contestingMian family member over decades, while their personal and party appeal cut across the ST-general divide.Ahmad said the redrawing of seats in Ganderbal-Kangan was patently flawed. ""There was no need to convert it into an ST seat. We never sought political reservation. I am a five-term MLA and now MP, I never asked,"" he said.As Kangan and Ahmad family revealed, there comes a point in the complicated political game of selfish motivations that larger considerations trump the normal logic of identity politics.When asked why should a tribal not welcome his seat being tagged as ST reserved, the parliamentarian shot back, ""My grandfather became an MLA in 1951 till 1967. Then my father was MLA till 1987. I was there till the assembly was dissolved in 2018. I trust the people. Why should I want it to become an ST reserved seat? The general masses back me and my family."" He conceded that general population in Kangan may be 4% more than STs.Asserting that he has seen many delimitations over the years, Ahmad alleged the one carried out in J&K was done to suit BJP, with an increase in six seats in Jammu and one in Kashmir. He said the delimitation attached parts of Rajouri (Jammu) with Anantnag (Kashmir) in Lok Sabha, but people voted against BJP, and he won by over 2.5 lakh votes. ""But just imagine that people of Rajouri have to come to their MP in Anantnag on a routine basis taking the Mughal road,"" he remarked.Claimed he, ""It was done on BJP's advice, but BJP has got trapped in it now."" He also blamed PDP for the ""mess of delimitation"" because it tied up with BJP in 2014.""The ground is hostile to BJP because of delimitation. The people see NC as the alternative, even though they have no love for us,"" he said.","Tribal family was winning an assembly segment for seven decades before it was abruptly reserved for STs this year. Now, the family vehemently protests the decision as ""injustice"" to general voters, even as it fights to keep its post- Independence grip on the constituency going.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113614315,imgsize-74540,width-400,resizemode-4/113614315.jpg"

relief for

social media intermediaries

'

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that mere viewing of child pornographic material on the internet is also an offence under Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and provisions of Information Technology Act, thus considerably expanding the scope of the two laws through purposive interpretation.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala said, ""Any act of viewing, distributing or displaying of any child pornographic material...over the internet without any actual or physical possession or storage of such material in any device or in any form or manner would also amount to 'possession' in terms of Sec 15 of Pocso Act .""The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' to set aside an ""egregiously erroneous"" order of Madras HC, which quashed a Pocso case against a porn-addict, saying he had not circulated it.In a significant step to check proliferation of child porn on the internet, SC Monday said social media intermediaries cannot claim exemption, or 'safe harbour', under IT Act without deleting such offensive videos, images and reporting about this to police as per Pocso Act mandate.Section 79 of IT Act provides 'safe harbour' to intermediaries, that is non-liability for third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by them, if they follow the prescribed due diligence. Pocso Act places an obligation on them to not only report offences thereunder but hand over material, including source from which such material originated, to the special juvenile police unit or the local police or cyber crime portal.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala referred to a MoU between National Crime Records Bureau under home ministry and National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US-based NGO, which requires all social media intermediaries to report cases of child abuse and exploitation to NCMEC for forwarding it to state police concerned for necessary action.The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities as mandated under Pocso Act. ""An intermediary cannot claim exemption from liability under Section 79 of IT Act for any third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by it, unless due diligence is conducted by it and compliance is made of these provisions of Pocso Act,"" the bench said.""Social media intermediaries, in addition to reporting the commission or the likely apprehension of commission of any offence under Pocso Act to NCMEC is also obligated to report the same to authorities specified under Section 19 of Pocso Act, ie special juvenile police unit or local police,"" it said.The bench cautioned courts against showing any leniency or leeway in offences under Section 21 of Pocso Act, ""particularly to schools/educational institutions, special homes, children's homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails etc who failed to discharge their obligation of reporting the commission or apprehension of commission of any offence or instance of child abuse or exploitation under Pocso Act"".",The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113613574,imgsize-168066,width-400,resizemode-4/113613574.jpg"

loom as govt pushes for ONOP

The Election Commission , in its submissions to the Kovind committee on ' one nation one election ', said conducting simultaneous polls across the country in 2029 would require Rs 7,951 crore, reports Bharti Jain. It sought a ""definite lead time"" before polls are synchronised as logistical requirements would go up enormously - from electoral rolls to EVMs and movement of security personnel.EC's inputs sent to the Law Commission in March 2023 - iterated in its Jan 19, 2024 letter to the Kovind panel - said the number of polling stations across the country would have to go up to 13.6 lakh in 2029.It estimated a shortfall of 26.5 lakh ballot units, 17.8 lakh control units and 17.8 lakh VVPATs.New Delhi: Apart from the challenge of getting the numbers to push through constitutional amendments for 'One Nation One Election', the govt also has to tackle several logistical issues, including regularisation of electoral rolls for panchayat polls.From electoral rolls to electronic voting machines and movement of personnel, the logistical requirements are enormous, sources said. In its submissions to the Kovind committee, Election Commission had sought a ""definite lead time"", while projecting funds requirement for the exercise in 2029 at Rs 7,951 crore.While electoral rolls for assembly and Lok Sabha polls are streamlined and a rigorous process is adopted in preparing them, the process for local body polls need to be streamlined, govt officials said, days after the Union cabinet accepted the recommendations of the committee led by former President Ram Nath Kovind on holdingsimultaneous elections .As per EC's inputs sent to the Law Commission in March 2023 - which it had reiterated in its letter dated Jan 19, 2024, to the Kovind committee - the number of polling stations across the country would have to be increased to around 13.6 lakh in 2029, requiring the deployment of 53.8 lakh ballot units (BUs), 38.7 lakh control units (CUs) and 41.6 lakh voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPATs).EC stated that while 30.8 lakh BUs, 22.1 lakh CUs and 23.8 lakh would be available for synchronised polls in the 2029 general election cycle, 3.6 lakh BUs and 1.25 lakh CUs would have completed their life and would need to be phased out. It had projected a shortfall of 26.5 lakh BUs, 17.8 lakh CUs and 17.8 lakh VVPATs.Given disruptions in the supply chain for semiconductors, the poll panel had highlighted this as a concern, and had called for ramping up the pace and capacity of production.Also stating that EVM models were regularly upgraded by the technical expert committee, with three models being developed in the past 20 years, the commission said it may be a possibility that the next generation EVM may be launched in the interim, posing a challenge as ""the entire magnitude of EVMs/VVPATs for simultaneous elections have to be manufactured afresh"".EC had also projected a major rise in manpower requirement in the event of simultaneous polls, saying that more polling personnel including the presiding officer will be needed at each polling station. It said additional staff would be required for first-level checks, transportation, security, storage and wider law and order requirements.Predicting a 50% rise in deployment of central forces in the event of synchronised polls, EC had said over 4.7 lakh personnel would be required if they are conducted in 2019. Though EC did not predict the requirement for the 2029 simultaneous polls, working with the same 50% rise, it could be almost 7 lakh security personnel. EC also said an additional 800 warehouses would be required for EVM/VVPAT storage.","The Election Commission said conducting simultaneous polls across the country in 2029 would require Rs 7,951 crore.

In several cases, such products cost more.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said Monday that the issue of “health-washing” has come to the department’s notice, and it will start working on formulating norms to ensure consumers do not get misled.She said guidelines for prohibiting “green-washing” and misleading advertisements by coaching centres are in the final stage, and will be released soon. The department is also carrying out consultation on prohibition of surrogate advertisements to protect consumers.“Green washing” refers to companies or entities making misleading claims about how environmentally friendly their products, services, or operations are, while “surrogate ads” are marketing techniques that indirectly promote brands and products, such as tobacco and alcohol, which are banned from advertising.There have been instances of alcohol and gutkha manufacturers promoting their brands through mineral water, playing cards and music CDs, and paan masala.These violations fall under misleading advertisements of the Consumer Protection Act. As per the law, resorting to misleading advertisements can attract a penalty of up to Rs 50 lakh and a maximum of five years in jail.Talking to reporters on the achievements of the first 100 days of the Modi govt, Khare said the department also wantse-commerce companies to stop selling banned and unsafe items through their websites.It has started nudging them to sign a “safety pledge” to stop promotion and selling of such items through their portals.As per the draft pledge, e-commerce companies will be expected to recall any hazardous or unsafe items being sold on their platform within 36 hours of being informed. “They also have to cooperate with government officials to identify the seller who is selling unsafe goods,” Khare said.The department referred to global best practices such as in the European Union, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Canada while preparing the draft norms. Khare said a panel with members from major e-commerce platforms, voluntary consumer associations, industry bodies and national law universities is expected to submit its report in two weeks.","“Green washing” refers to companies or entities making misleading claims about how environmentally friendly their products, services, or operations are. “Surrogate ads” are marketing techniques that indirectly promote brands and products, such as tobacco and alcohol, which are banned from advertising.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

"Congress govt will open Shambhu border for farmers, will give legal guarantee of MSP: Hooda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-govt-will-open-shambhu-border-for-farmers-will-give-legal-guarantee-of-msp-hooda/articleshow/113608080.cms,"AMBALA: Former Haryana CM and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the Congress will open the Shambhu border of Haryana for farmers after it forms the government in the state. This question was raised to the Congress by the Kisan Mahapanchayat held in Pipli on Sunday, asking whether the Congress would open the Shambhu and Khanauri borders of Haryana to allow farmers to proceed to Delhi to protest for their pending demands.Farmers have been sitting on Haryana’s borders since February 13, for over 220 days, in an attempt to reach the national capital, but the incumbent BJP government in Haryana has blocked the border with concrete walls, heavy police, and paramilitary forces.Hooda was in Ambala on Monday to seek votes for his party’s Ambala City candidate, Nirmal Singh. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge was also scheduled to visit Ambala, but his visit was cancelled.Hooda also promised to establish an Industrial Model Township (IMT) in Ambala to boost industrial and employment growth in the region.Addressing the gathering, Hooda said the BJP has no faith in democracy. “This dictatorial government first imposed three anti-farmer laws and then used lathis and fired bullets on farmers when they opposed these laws. Roads were dug up to stop the farmers, and even now, the Haryana government has stopped the farmers at the Shambhu border. Due to this, traders are also suffering huge losses,” Hooda said.“When the Congress government is formed, the Shambhu border will be opened, and farmers will be given a legal guarantee of MSP . At the same time, Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the demand to implement the Swaminathan Commission report for farmers at the Centre,” Hooda added.Hooda further said that Ambala had neither a sewer system, nor a stadium, nor walkable roads before the formation of the Congress government. “The Congress government established all the facilities in Ambala. Now, our goal is to establish IMT here to advance Ambala from an industrial point of view. With the establishment of IMT, new employment opportunities will develop in Ambala,” he said.“Along with this, the seven guarantees given by the Congress so far will be fulfilled. The BJP is questioning where the budget will come from. First of all, the BJP should explain where they will get the budget from, as they have copied the Congress manifesto,” he added.Candidate from Ambala City, Nirmal Singh, said, “We have seen the tenure of the Congress government led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda for 10 years. He waived the electricity bills of farmers worth Rs 1,600 crore with a stroke of the pen. Loans worth Rs 2,300 crore were also waived.”“Haryana became the number one state in the country under Congress rule. It was Congress that implemented schemes like the Green Revolution, MNREGA, RTI, Right to Education, Right to Food, Mid-Day Meal, and the nationalization of banks in the country,” Nirmal Singh added.","Farmers have been sitting on Haryana’s borders since February 13, for over 220 days, in an attempt to reach the national capital.

"SC to hear Himachal’s plea on Shanan power project on Nov 8, asks Punjab and Centre to respond",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-hear-himachals-plea-on-shanan-power-project-on-nov-8-asks-punjab-and-centre-to-respond/articleshow/113607983.cms,"SHIMLA: Agreeing to hear the Himachal Pradesh government’s preliminary objections to the Punjab government ’s suit to restrain the Congress government in the hill state from claiming possession of the Shanan Hydropower Project in Jogindernagar upon the expiry of a 99-year lease, the Supreme Court on Monday directed both Punjab and the central government to respond.The bench, comprising Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Pankaj Mithal, while posting the case hearing for November 8, clarified that the court would first address the Himachal Pradesh government’s preliminary objections to the Punjab government’s original suit regarding the 110-megawatt pre-independence era hydel project. As the 99-year lease expired on March 2, the Punjab government had approached the apex court seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the Himachal Pradesh government from taking possession of the hydel power project.The Himachal Pradesh government submitted before the top court that in 1925, the then king of Mandi leased the land to the central government for 99 years to set up the Shanan Power Project, and the lease ended in March this year. Therefore, Himachal Pradesh now has a rightful claim over the project, and the Punjab government’s suit cannot be entertained by the apex court under Article 131 since it is based on a treaty and agreement beyond the court’s jurisdiction in such cases, said Himachal Pradesh advocate general Anup Kumar Rattan.","The Supreme Court on Monday directed both Punjab and the central government to respond.
