Bill for oversight of Waqf Boards likely in Lok Sabha today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-for-oversight-of-waqf-boards-likely-in-lok-sabha-today/articleshow/112359721.cms,"Oppn wants bill be sent to parl panel,

Muslim bodies

threaten to launch stir

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition ’s demand that it be sent to a joint committee, the govt is set to introduce the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in Lok Sabha on Thursday that proposes far-reaching changes to restrain the powers of Waqf Boards to declare a property as ‘Waqf’ and introduce a detailed process to do so, including preliminary survey by the district magistrate instead of the survey officer of the board as a pre-requisite for any such determination.The bill seeks to broaden the composition of the Central Waqf Council and state Waqf Boards by providing for representation of Muslim women and non-Muslim members.The bill also provides for a full-time chief executive officer of Waqf Boards to be appointed by the state govt and who shall not be below the rank of joint secretary to the state govt and not necessarily a Muslim.The most critical of the proposed amendments relates to the repeal of Section 40 of the existing law that empowers Waqf Boards to decide if a property is a Waqf asset, change in the composition of Waqf tribunals and allowing for appeals in high courts against their decisions within 90 days.Accordingly, the provision in the current Act which says “decision of the tribunal in respect of such matter shall be final” will be dropped. Introduced in 2013 under the Congress-led UPA govt , this provision has been a bone of contention.To address a long-pending demand, the bill also provides for establishment of separate Board of Auqaf for Bohras and Agakhanis; besides providing representation of Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and backward Muslims in Waqf Boards.Issuance of a ‘Waqf deed’ and certification will be mandatory for new properties under assessment.The move comes amid strong opposition by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board which has threatened to launch a mass movement, and organisations like Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind.At the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee , opposition parties demanded that the legislation be sent to a parliamentary committee .Sources said parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju , also the minister of minority affairs, said the govt would take a decision on Thursday.Interestingly, with the department-related standing committees not in place yet, the bill may be forwarded to a special committee in case govt accepts the opposition’s demand.","The govt is set to introduce the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in Lok Sabha on Thursday.

What’s the broader idea behind the amendments?

What’s the Muslim Personal Law Board saying?

NEW DELHI: The government is set to introduce a bill to amend the Waqf Act , 1995, to check the unbridled powers, enhanced futher by a 2013 amendment, of Waqf Boards in what has been termed an attempt to introduce transparency and accountability in the regulation and monitoring of over 8.7 lakh properties under control of state boards across the country and weed out corruption. TOI explains what comprises Waqf and what is ailing management of assets under the boards.Waqf refers to properties dedicated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.Once designated as Waqf, ownership is transferred from the person making the Waqf (waqif) to Allah, making it irrevocable. These properties are managed by a mutawwali, appointed by waqif or a competent authority. Waqf boards control 8.7 lakh properties spanning 9.4 lakh acres across India, with estimated value of Rs 1.2 lakh crore. There are 32 Waqf boards, including two Shia Waqf boards (in Uttar Pradesh & Bihar).Once a property is declared Waqf, it remains so forever. This irrevocability has led to various disputes and claims, some of which, like the claim on two islands in Bet Dwarka, have perplexed courts. Examples of some other disputes include the Bengaluru Eidgah ground, claimed as Waqf property from the 1850s, and the Surat Municipal Corporation building, claimed due to its historical use as a ‘sarai’ during Haj in the Mughal era. Kolkata’s Tollygunge Club and Royal Calcutta Golf Club are on Waqf land, so is ITC Windsor Hotel in Bengaluru. Encroachment on Waqf properties is also a challenge.The concept of Waqf in India dates back to Delhi Sultanate, with early examples including Sultan Muizuddin Sam Ghaor’s (Muhammad Ghori) dedication of villages to Jama Masjid of Multan. Mussalman Waqf Act, 1923, marked the first attempt to regulate it. In independent India, the Waqf Act was first passed by Parliament in 1954. It was replaced by a new Waqf Act in 1995 which gave more power to Waqf boards. The accretion of power has been accompanied by increase in number of complaints of encroachment and illegal lease and sale of Waqf properties. In 2013, the Act was amended and the changes, many argue, conferred unlimited powers on Waqf boards to claim properties in the name of Muslim charity. The amendments made sale of Waqf properties impossible. Neither the mutawwali (custodian) nor the Waqf board has rights to sell a Waqf property.Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995, gives Waqf boards the power to decide if a property is Waqf property. There are complaints this power has been misused by vested interests for property grab with the help of the corrupt Waqf bureaucracy. There have also been allegations of misuse of powers given to boards regarding appointment of mutawwalis and cases challenging appointment of managers. The bill proposes to repeal the controversial section altogether and vest powers in the collector. Interestingly, even countries that follow Muslim law do not have a Waqf body with such powers.The main change in definition was made in 2013, when the expression ‘permanent dedication by a person professing Islam’ was replaced by ‘permanent dedication by any person’. After this amendment, it is believed Waqf has opened the floodgates for dedication of property to Waqf boards by any person.Disputes have mounted over the years, and the Waqf bureaucracy has been criticised for inefficacy, leading to issues like encroachment, mismanagement, ownership disputes, and delays in registration and surveys. There are 40,951 cases pending in tribunals which are part of the Waqf system. The problem is compounded by the absence of judicial oversight on decisions of tribunals which exclusively comprise members of Waqf bureaucracy. The law has been under growing public scrutiny after 2013, with complaints coming from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Bohras, and OBC Muslims.Flaws in the appeal process are also a big concern. For instance, an appeal against a board decision lies with the tribunal but the latter has no timeline for disposal of cases. The tribunal’s decision is final and there is no provision for appeal except under writ jurisdiction in high courts. Moreover, some states don’t have tribunals, making the Waqf bureaucacy the ultimate arbiter.In states with a single Waqf board, the need is felt to have representation from minority sects among Muslims, like Bohras and Shias, as well as OBC Muslims, the Pasmandas. Misuse of ‘Waqf-al-Aulad’ provision to deny inheritance rights to women and orphans in certain cases is another concern sought to be aaddressed by the bill.Sachar Committee’s 2006 report recommended need for regulation, efficient management of records, inclusion of non-Muslim technical expertise in Waqf management and bringing Waqf under the scheme of financial audit, among other things. Similarly, the joint parliamentary committee’s report on Waqf presented to Rajya Sabha in March 2008 recommended revamping the composition of Waqf boards, proposing appointment of a senior officer as CEO for state Waqf boards, stringent action for unauthorised alienation of Waqf properties, stringent punishment to mutawwalis for corruption, creating scope for intervention by HC in some cases, computerisation of Waqf boards and adequate representation to the Shia community in the Central Waqf Council.The idea, govt says, is to modernise management of Waqf properties, protect women’s rights, ensure fair representation in Central Waqf Council and Waqf boards, reduce litigation, have effective coordination with revenue dept and also provide judicial oversight on tribunal decisions.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has called the bill an interference with personal laws, and threatened to start a mass movement. But the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, the apex body representing Sufi shrines, has welcomed govt’s proposal alleging Waqf boards work in a “dictatorial” manner.","Waqf refers to properties dedicated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.

They are frustrated and will do anything to push the country, a bright global spot, backwards due to political vendetta . The statement is an invitation to anarchy and shows the anti-democratic outlook of the a party which talks about the Constitution,” Thakur told reporters.His colleagues, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sambit Patra also joined in the attack.The sharp response coincides with growing apprehension in govt and BJP quarters over what they call a plot to organise disruptions by engineering protests. Home minister Amit Shah had late last month cautioned BJP CMs against plots to organise protests by farmers and others.Patra said Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was present at the book launch event along with Khurshid, kept mum about his colleague’s objectionable statement. “This is a serious issue. When we are witnessing such a situation in neighbouring countries, the main opposition party Congress wants the same situation in India,” he told reporters outside Parliament. He also referred to Rahul Gandhi ’s “objectionable” remarks during his visits abroad.Rudy dubbed Khurshid’s comments as “anarchist”. “He is a member of CWC, this is an anarchist statement, I think it is a kind of sedition. It’s unfortunate Congress is resorting to such anarchist statements to hide its failure.”","Former Union minister Anurag Thakur said the Congress neta’s remark had laid bare Congress's wish and intent to create anarchy.

2 arrested for pouring water at Taj Mahal, Hindu outfit says 'Gangajal' offered to 'Tejo Mahalay'

Agra Police arrested two youths for pouring water at the Taj Mahal, claiming it to be a Hindu temple. The suspects entered as tourists and were reported by the CISF. A local group, ABHM, later claimed that the two were their members who offered holy 'Gangajal' inside the premises. A detailed investigation is underway.

AGRA: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Tuesday banned visitors and guides from carrying water bottles into the Taj Mahal ’s main mausoleum after repeated incidents of ‘ jalabhishek ’ (religious water ritual) by members of various right-wing groups . Carrying water bottles has been prohibited from the Taj’s Chameli Farsh to the main dome area.Two members of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha were arrested on Saturday for offering Ganga water at the mausoleum, claiming the monument was a Shiva temple before being converted to a mausoleum by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.Additionally, on the third Monday of Sawan, Meera Rathore, the district president of the Mahasabha’s women’s wing, performed ‘jalabhishek’ and hoisted a saffron flag at the Unesco World Heritage Site. The move to ban water inside the Taj has come in for criticism from some quarters.Deepak Dan, president of the Tourist Guides Welfare Association, said: “Tourists cannot remain in the Taj Mahal without water during hot and humid weather. Instead of being vigilant, authorities are imposing restrictions on water bottles. The association opposes this move.” He added, “Multiple cases of tourists passing out due to adverse weather conditions have surfaced in the last three months. Without water, visitors, especially children and the elderly, will suffer. The decision will also present a bad image among foreign tourists.”ASI superintending archaeologist Rajkumar Patel assured that visitors would not face inconvenience.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge.

Vinesh Phogat Disqualified; Kangana Reacts To Her Performance At paris Olympics 2024 | Watch

India's Vinesh Phogat , who on Tuesday entered the final of the women's 50kg freestyle wrestling event at the Paris Olympics , was found overweight on the second day of the competition and has been disqualified from the Paris Olympics. As a result, she won't contest in the final today and will miss a historic podium finish.The statement by the Indian Olympic Associationi says: ""It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the Women’s Wrestling 50kg class.Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning. No further comments will be made by the contingent at this time. The Indian team requests you respect Vinesh’s privacy. It would like to focus on the competitions on hand.""Vinesh was scheduled to face USA's Sarah Hildebrandt for the gold medal.""She was found overweight by 100gm this morning (Wednesday). The rules do not allow this and she has been disqualified,"" said an Indian coach.Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinal, will replace the disqualified Indian in the final against the American.""Vinesh failed second day weigh-in. According to the article 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh (IND) will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the Semifinal. Therefore Yusneylis Guzman Lopez (CUB) will compete in the Final,"" the Paris Games organising committee said in a statement.""Repechage Yui Susaki (Japan) vs Oksana Livach (Ukraine) will become bronze medal match,"" it added.As per a report in The Indian Express, Vinesh met the weight criteria for her bouts on Tuesday but the rules state that athletes should weigh within their weight category on both days of the event.The report also says that Vinesh was 2kg overweight on Tuesday night and worked out almost the entire night in hope of meeting the weight criteria on the day of her final. But that didn't materialise and requests by the Indian delegation to allow Vinesh some time to lose that extra 100 gm were not entertained.Vinesh will now end up last in the standings in the 50kg event at the Paris Games.She had famously defeated defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan in the pre-quarterfinals. Susaki had been unbeaten in her international career (82-0) before that match.However, Vinesh's is not the only case of disqualification beause of being overweight in the women's 50kg event at the Paris Games.On Tuesday, Italy's Emanuela Liuzzi was also forced to forfeit her preliminary bout after being found overweight.The intense overnight workout and drastic measures to reduce her weight led to Vinesh getting dehydrated, according to reports, and is receiving medical care in Paris.Reacting to the entire episode that struck India's campaign in Paris, PM Narendra Modi posted on X (formerly Twitter) to show his support for Vinesh. ""Today's setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing,"" the PM wrote.","Vinesh Phogat was found overweight on the second day of the competition.

The decision came as the party decided to hold consultations within and outside on the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes to finalise its stance in the wake of the recent Supreme Court judgement .A brainstorming by the Congress brass, led by Mallikarjun Kharge, with key leaders, decided to hold extensive dialogue with the party’s state units, chief ministers, INDIA bloc allies and civil society members for feedback on the sensitive issue.Sources said the meeting elicited individual views of participants. Many of them criticised the judgment’s extension of “creamy layer” concept to SCs and STs. Meanwhile, in Lok Sabha, DMK’s A Raja slammed “creamy layer” for SCs/STs and urged govt to introduce safeguards to protect the rights of the two communities in the light of the court judgement.The participants discussed the pros and cons of sub-classification while also quoting the views of BSP’s Mayawati and BJP ally LJP’s Chirag Paswan — both have opposed it.The meeting included Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Abhishek Singhvi, Vivek Tankha, Charanjit Channi, Kumari Selja, PL Punia, Mukul Wasnik, Randeep Surjewala, Udit Raj, Rajesh Lilothia, Nasir Hussain and Jairam Ramesh.While the Congress, like other parties, is treading with caution on sub-categorisation, party insiders felt there was need to up the pressure on other fronts where the longstanding reservation pie is shrinking. Udit Raj said the party will renew its demand that the 50% bar on total SC/ST/OBC reservation be relaxed through a constitutional amendment. Also, the Congress will ask govt to fill “backlog vacancies” and institute quotas inoutsourced projects — the logic being that outsourcing of govt work is leading to erosion of reservation available in govt appointments. There is also likely to be increased rhetoric against privatisation of PSUs.Meanwhile, civil society groups will hold a nationwide bandh against sub-categorisation on Aug 21, and will see the involvement of some Congress leaders too.Many feel that sub-categorisation also concerns tribals, besides Dalits, and discussions will have to include the ST representatives. The Congress meeting did not have any ST member. The issue is of special concern to election-bound Maharashtra and Jharkhand because of their large SC/ST population, while Haryana has the highest dalit population in the country after Punjab.",The Congress is set to ratchet up pressure for removal of 50% ceiling on reservation and push for quotas in the big projects outsourced by govt.

"Phogat 'victim of BJP', claims Congress while TMC alleges 'Conspiracy' behind her ouster",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/phogat-victim-of-bjp-claims-congress-while-tmc-alleges-conspiracy-behind-her-ouster/articleshow/112355818.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Parliament session on Wednesday was all about Vinesh Phogat ’s disqualification at the Olympics. It turned into a political storm in the House, with opposition parties talking about sabotage and questioning officials for their alleged failure to save the wrestler from slipping up on the protocol and challenge her subsequent disqualification.Both Houses witnessed heated exchanges between opposition and treasury benches over Vinesh, while Parliament’s corridors resonated with disappointment and conspiracy theories on how the govt did not do enough for the celebrated wrestler, who had embarrassed BJP last year by accusing national wrestling body chief Brijbhushan Saran Singh, then a BJP MP, of sexual harassment and launching a long sit-in protest.Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya faced opposition ire when he made a statement in Lok Sabha, yielding to demands for a clarification from govt. He narrated how the Centre had provided every possible help to the wrestler and gave details of the amount of funds that the govt spent on her to be at the Olympics.Congress members Gaurav Gogoi, Deepender Hooda and Shafi Parambil protested and asked why govt was providing details of funds spent on Vinesh rather than giving reasons for failing to challenge the disqualification.Parambil said, “I don’t think it was right on the part of govt to quote the amount spent on her practice when the whole world was listening. This is not BJP leaders’ personal wealth. It’s the money of the people.” Criticising the mention of the amount spent by govt on Vinesh’s training, Congress, SP, TMC, DMK as well as independent member Pappu Yadav, Hanuman Beniwal (RLP) and Chandrashekhar Azad walked out.In Rajya Sabha, TMC MP Derek O’Brien hinted at a “conspiracy” behind Vinesh’s disqualification. Expressing solidarity with Vinesh, “who went through a lot”, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi urged IOA to strongly contest the wrestler’s case, even as party MP Randeep Surjewala alleged “conspiracy” behind the disqualification of the wrestler who he said was a victim of BJP.Rahul said, “It is unfortunate that Vinesh, India’s pride, was disqualified on technical grounds. We have full hope that IOA will strongly challenge this decision and provide justice to the daughter of the country.”Kharge added, “From protesting on the footpaths for justice to reaching the pinnacle podium of the Olympics.... it is extremely distressing... what she must be going through.”Surjewala alleged Vinesh was disqualified as part of a conspiracy and the answer to the plot lay in the question — “who could not digest the victory of Vinesh?”","Both Houses witnessed heated exchanges between opposition and treasury benches over Vinesh.

SC patiently heard the duo but came to the conclusion that the action of the investigating officer seeking custody of the accused, and of the judicial magistrate granting custody, are clearly in the teeth of its order and held them guilty of contempt of court.Though SC had issued notice to brass of Surat Police , including the commissioner along with the judicial magistrate and additional chief secretary of Gujarat’s home department for contempt, it convicted only the investigating officer who filed an application seeking custody and the magistrate who allowed the plea, and let off the rest saying they were not involved.“The portrayal made by the investigating officer in the remand application to claim the accused-petitioner was not cooperating in the investigation was totally cooked up and a clear attempt to draw wool over the court’s eyes... We are, therefore, inclined to hold that there was not even a shred of bona fide in the actions of the investigating officer while seeking police custody remand of the accused on the purported ground of non-cooperation in investigation,” the bench said.Slamming the ACJM , SC said a magistrate must not allow a plea of police without application of mind. “The courts are not expected to act as messengers of investigating agencies and remand applications should not be allowed in a routine manner.”SC, during the hearing, had said it was high time the people holding posts learn a lesson and had made it clear that they would be sent behind bars if needed.

'Victim of sports politics': Opposition questions govt on Vinesh Phogat's Olympics disqualification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/victim-of-sports-politics-opposition-questions-govt-on-vinesh-phogats-olympics-disqualification/articleshow/112351262.cms,"Will there be a detailed inquiry of the doctors, support team sanctioned and selected by the IOA?

As an athlete herself did the chairperson PT Usha ensure that Vinesh was being monitored constantly to keep her well within the category she was competing in?

Did the support team not ensure her weight and diet besides her training were being constantly supervised? After all it was the Olympics that one is competing in.

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Wednesday questioned the government over wrestler Vinesh Phogat 's disqualification and slammed Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya for defending the support team and making her the ""fall girl"". The Congress claimed that Phogat had become a ""victim of sports politics"" and questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP ministers and leaders did not congratulate her on August 6, when the wrestler won three matches in a row and scripted history.Phogat was disqualified from the Olympics after being found overweight ahead of her women's 50kg final.She was one win away from clinching India's first gold medal at the Paris Olympics and was set to face United States wrestler Sarah Ann Hildebrandt for the gold medal on Wednesday night. Immediately after her disqualification, Prime Minister Modi described wrestler Vinesh Phogat as a ""champion among champions"" and exuded confidence that she would come back stronger following her disqualification from the final Olympic bout.""Vinesh, you are a champion among champions! You are India's pride and an inspiration for each and every Indian. Today's setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing. At the same time, I know that you epitomise resilience. It has always been your nature to take challenges head on,"" PM Modi posted on X. ""Come back stronger! We are all rooting for you,"" he added.However, the Congress linked today's developments to the protests against former Wrestling Federation of India head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is facing trial over charges of sexual harassment and intimidation by women wrestlers. Vinesh Phogat had played an active role in the protests and had endured police detention, nights on the streets.""Vinesh Phogat did not lose on the mat of wrestling, but lost on the mat of conspiracy,"" Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said as he claimed that the wrestler had to suffer due to politics in sports.Sports minister Mandaviya, who today made a statement in Lok Sabha on her disqualification, said Vinesh Phogat's weight was 100gm more than the permissible limit for the category and the IOA has lodged a strong protest against the wrestler's disqualification. The sports minister also gave details of the expenditure incurred on training of Phogat and said she was given everything she needed for her Olympics preparation.Reacting to Mandaviya's statement, NCP(SCP) leader Supriya Sule accused the sports minister of indirectly blaming Vinesh to be overweight and demanded a high-level probe against the support team. ""The statement of the sports minister in Parliament on Vinesh Phogat is highly condemnable. Vinesh has lost a medal and there has to be a detailed inquiry of the nutritionist, the doctors, a physiotherapist, and the entire support team sanctioned and selected by the IOA that accompanied her. It’s the team’s job to ensure her fitness, diet and regimen during the Olympics to ensure her success. Her job was to go and win and bring glory to India, as a proud daughter of India,"" Sule said.""The support team was approved by the government and IOA and has to be held accountable. Mansukh Mandavia, the sports minister, justifying and defending the team is absurd and disgusting, indirectly blaming Vinesh to be overweight. She is a proud daughter of India who made the finals against all odds and much to the chagrin of the powers that be. Is this why she gets the blame and all the rest go scot free? A tweet here or there asking for an investigation by the IOC means nothing. It’s a sad day for sports and the seriousness with which the government and IOA treat women athletes,"" Sule added.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also alleged that the Union sports minister had made Vinesh Phogat the ""fall girl"" and wondered if this was because the wrestler had taken the ""government head on in her quest for justice against BrijBhushan Sharan Singh.""Priyanka Chaturvedi posted questions for the government:The Shiv Sena (UBT) leader said that Vinesh was a brave and strong woman who had withstood all challenges thrown her way, including attempts to end her career. ""The Indian Olympic Association needs to fight this injustice out and make a strong case for Vinesh,"" she added.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann also raised questions about the members of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).""I don't want to connect with this politics. But please tell me, have the members of the Indian Olympic Association gone there on holiday? Indian Olympic Association did not object to this even once. There was no tweet (from PM Modi) when she (Vinesh Phogat) reached the final, but a tweet was posted when she was disqualified. Come on!"" Bhagwant Mann told reporters.""To check her weight was the work of her coaches and physiotherapists. Now, the decision has come. This injustice should have been stopped. Did they (The Centre) fix anyone's accountability at the time when our women wrestlers went to immerse their medals in the river. Such mistakes are happening on such a high level. Coaches and physiotherapists are paid in lakhs. Have they gone there for holidays?"" he added.The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President Sanjay Singh demanded action against the support staff attached with Vinesh Phogat in the wake of her shock exit from the Paris Olympics, saying the blunder of not maintaining her weight before the final was not acceptable.(With inputs from agencies)",Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the women's wrestling at the Rio Olympics. She was found to be over the weight limit for the event. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has launched an investigation into the matter.

The decision was based on evidence from the Phulwarisharif PFI case , which involved a conspiracy to disrupt Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s visit to Patna in July 2022, as well as other ISIS-inspired terror plots under investigation by the NIA and several state police forces.The order of the UAPA tribunal , put out in a gazette notification issued on Tuesday, stated that based on evidence and material provided to it, “it is evident that SIMI continues to engage in unlawful and terrorist activities despite being banned”.It added: “The organization is expanding its ranks by indoctrinating young boys and operating through front organizations. SIMI maintains connections with various terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, ISIS and Indian Mujahideen. It continues to receive both domestic and international funding, which supports its activities in India... it is clear that several accused persons, who have committed various offences across different jurisdictions, have been identified as members or activists of SIMI. By conspiring together, they committed numerous offences aligned with SIMI's ideologies and propaganda”.The tribunal observed that the evidence in cases involving ex-SIMI cadres — who are now either affiliated with Popular Front of India (PFI), also banned under UAPA, or found to be carrying out ISIS propaganda and plotting/executing attacks to further the global terror outfit’s ideology favouring Islamic rule — “effectively establishes the fact that despite the previous bans, SIMI is still active through its members and activists.”One of the key testimonies relied upon by the tribunal while confirming the ban on SIMI is that of NIA officer Vipin Kumar, who had deposed that the key accused in Phulwarisharif PFI case, Athar Parvej and Jalaluddin, were connected with SIMI members and taking their help for planning and commission of terrorist acts.The investigators had recovered incriminating documents titled ‘India 2047: Towards Rule of Islam in India’ that chronicled how PFI intends to replace democratic govt in India with Islamic rule by creating disaffection and getting cadres trained in use of crude weapons, to commit violent acts. Parvej had confessed that he, on PFI’s direction, was preparing a secret group of ex-SIMI members to avenge “atrocities against Muslims and derogatory remarks against Islam” and cited the targeted attacks against Hindu individuals in Amravati and Udaipur. The PFI ‘vision document’ found his Parvej’s home was the basis for declaration of the organization as an “unlawful association” under UAPA in 2022.

Gig work: A growing appetite

Investing in skills is key

Embracing the future

Preparing for transience

The Indian job market is at an inflection point. While the traditional full-time model persists, a silent revolution is brewing — the rise of temporary work. Let’s delve into the data-driven future of temporary staffing in India, exploring its potential impact on job structures, skill sets, and the overall employment landscape.Studies by the World Employment Confederation and International Labour Organisation (ILO) paint a clear picture: temporary work is on the rise globally.India is no exception. Reports from TeamLease, a leading staffing firm, indicate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% in the temporary staffing market for 2022. Experts predict this trend to continue, with the temporary workforce potentially doubling by 2030 to touch a staggering 10 million. This points to a significant shift from the present, paving the way for a more transient job market.Gone are the days of temporary work being synonymous with basic, repetitive tasks. A report by global staffing companies highlights a crucial trend — temporary jobs are climbing up the value chain. Companies are increasingly seeking highly skilled professionals for projectbased work, peak seasons, or specialised expertise. This shift is driven by factors like globalisation, technological advancements, and the need for agility. This presents a unique opportunity for skilled professionals.Temporary work can offer:While reports by ILO acknowledge the rise of temporary work, they also caution against job insecurity. But the reality is that traditional job security — with defined career paths and long tenures — is becoming less prevalent and, as a matter of fact, it impedes the ability to maximise dignified earnings in the dynamic world we live in today. Companies are increasingly adopting a projectbased approach, requiring a more adaptable workforce. This doesn’t negate the need for job security, but rather redefines it. The future lies in portable skills, adaptability, and a robust social security system that supports temporary workers.The rise of the gig economy , fuelled by digital platforms, further underscores the growing acceptance of temporary work arrangements. Organisations are showing a greater appetite for gig workers, particularly for tasks like marketing, content creation, and data analysis. This trend is expected to surge — a Nasscom-Aon report predicts a 78% increase in India’s gig workforce by 2025 to reach an estimated 25 million gig workers.This translates into a significant portion of the workforce embracing the flexibility and project-based nature of gig work. While income variability exists, a report by Aspire Circle (a leading gig work platform) indicates an average income of Rs 25,000 per month for skilled gig workers in India. The figure can vary depending on the specific skill, experience level, and platform used. However, it highlights the potential for gig work to provide a competitive income stream for skilled individuals.To truly harness the potential of temporary work, a focus on skill development is paramount. Reports by TeamLease emphasise the need for investments in creating industryspecific skill sets across all levels. Apprenticeship programmes, as championed by the government, can act as a vital gateway to employment, equipping individuals with the necessary skills to thrive in the temporary job market.The future of work in India extends beyond just temporary jobs. It’s a paradigm shift towards a more agile and adaptable workforce. McKinsey’s remote work study reveals that a significant portion of tasks can be done remotely, potentially impacting talent pools for temporary roles. The World Economic Forum ’s “Reskilling Revolution” emphasises the need to equip workers with in-demand skills like complex problem-solving and creativity. Similarly, reports by PwC and EY highlight the rising demand for specialised skills in temporary positions.This dynamic landscape demands a multi-pronged approach. We need robust investments in skill development programmes tailored to the evolving needs of the temporary job market. Apprenticeship initiatives and industry-specific skilling efforts must be prioritised. Additionally, social security measures need to be adopted to provide a safety net for temporary workers.By embracing this future of work, India can unlock a wave of opportunity. It’s time to move beyond traditional models and empower a skilled, adaptable workforce ready to thrive in the transient job market. Let’s equip India for the future, today.As Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate economist, aptly stated, “The key is to be skilled and adaptable. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” By prioritising skilling and embracing adaptability, India can ensure its workforce is not just prepared for the transient future, but actively shaping it.

Thin & fair?: Brides-to-be say it’s time to not care,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thin-fair-brides-to-be-say-its-time-to-not-care/articleshow/112356146.cms,"(mothermonials.com site, enabled with AI, is also assisting women to express themselves better)

Fair. Beautiful. Thin. These attributes once part of matrimonial ads are making way for the new beauty gauge — confidence, intelligence, emotional maturity and a touch of ‘chocolate/caramel skin’ — as society is fully primed to shift from long-held, longunquestioned societal norms.Boxed in by narrow beauty standards perpetuated by matrimonial advertisements with trite descriptors, young women and brides-to-be are coming under unrealistic expectations and pressure.Now, the kids on the marriage block are embracing their authentic selves . Brides-to-be are among the worse impacted by societal pressure to meet beauty standards, often feeling the need to conform to certain ideals just to find a suitable partner.However, a new generation is pushing back against these narrow definitions of beauty. Jenny John, 24, shared her journey of self-acceptance with TOI. Once told her ‘dark’ skin would make marriage prospects tough, Jenny now celebrates her “chocolate/caramel skin” as an asset. “I feel it’s my strength, my beauty. I don’t wonder or fear anymore about getting married. I know there will be people who will love me for who and what I am intrinsically,” she said.Bride-to-be Meghna K expressed similar sentiments. After years of feeling pressured to conform to societal beauty standards, she’s now embracing her brown skin and curvy body. “Growing up, I felt I had to fit certain descriptions to be considered worthy. But now, I realise how limiting and harmful these ideas are. I’ve decided to reject outdated norms and embrace my true self,” she said.It’s not just young adults and brides-to-be. Teenagers have also felt the pressure of this matrimonial culture. “For years, I felt pressured to be fair and slim because that’s what I saw in matrimonial ads,” said Reshma Shirin, a 19-year-old student.“It took me years to take pictures without filters that whitewash us. Society wants us to be whitewashed; when we try, they call us fake. It’s all about the right people who make you feel loved for being yourself. No filters. No whitewashing. Just pure love from people who appreciate your beauty, both inside and outside,” she added.Matchmakers across Bengaluru have noticed this shift in attitudes. Meenaka Kumar, a seasoned matchmaker, observed that men are no longer solely focused on physical appearances, and women are crafting more honest, empowered profiles.“People are looking for traits like smart, financially independent, and politically aware partners,” Kumar noted, indicating a broader change in marriage priorities. Poornima Bhasker, a relationship adviser, echoed these observations.She highlighted that women are making smarter choices and valuing their confidence, intelligence, and emotional maturity over traditional beauty standards . Beauty brand Dove, in partnership with TOI, is trying to turn traditional matrimonials promoting outdated beauty standards into empowering ‘mothermonials’ that inspire society to see brides beyond stereotypes.","Young women and brides-to-be are coming under unrealistic expectations and pressure.

I wrote multiple letters on this issue to the govt highlighting how the students from the minority community are being deprived of the benefits that other communities are getting through BARTI, Mahajyoti, Saarthi, Amrut, etc. This was a much needed move to ensure benefits of higher education to the students of disadvantaged minority communities. However, the state govt must make adequate budgetary allocations for the same. We want to see this announcement turning it into reality. It shouldn't be election propaganda to woo the Muslim community ahead of the assembly elections,” Shaikh said.“A total of 11 posts will be created for this organization. Similarly, the cabinet has also approved a total expenditure of Rs. 6.25 crore is expected. Muslims, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Parsis are the minority citizens of the state. Problems related to their social, educational, economic development will be studied through this institution,” said an official.","A decision was taken in the state cabinet to establish a Minority Research and Training Institute.

"Allegations of removing preamble from textbooks is baseless: Prof Ranjana Arora, NCERT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/allegations-of-removing-preamble-from-textbooks-is-baseless-prof-ranjana-arora-ncert/articleshow/112315516.cms,"NCERT’s response on the issue

What changes have been made to NCERT textbooks?

For textbooks of class 3:

For textbooks of class 6:

NEW DELHI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT ) has made notable adjustments to its curriculum for the current academic year by removing the Preamble to the Indian Constitution from several Class 3 and Class 6 textbooks . This change affects textbooks in subjects such as languages and environmental studies.For Class 3, the Preamble has been excluded from textbooks for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and ""World Around Us,"" which replaces the former Environmental Studies (EVS) subject.Previously, the Preamble was featured in the introductory pages of these books, serving as an initial exposure to the core values of the Indian Constitution.In Class 6, the Preamble is no longer present in the new English textbook ""Poorvi"" and the Sanskrit textbook ""Deepakam."" The environmental studies content has been reduced from three textbooks to one. However, the Preamble remains in the Hindi textbook ""Malhar"" and the science textbook ""Curiosity.""In response to concerns about these changes, NCERT stated in an official tweet that their educational materials aim to provide a thorough understanding of constitutional values. Professor Ranjana Arora, Head of the Department of Curriculum Studies and Development at NCERT, stated in the official statement, ""The notion that only the Preamble reflects constitutional values is false. We intend to impart these values in a variety of ways, in line with theNEP-2020 's vision for holistic child development.NCERT has responded to the controversy surrounding the removal of the Preamble from textbooks, claiming that the claims lack substance. NCERT tweeted, ""For the first time, NCERT is emphasising various aspects of the Indian Constitution, including the Preamble, Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights, and the National Anthem, across different textbooks and stages."" The assumption that only the Preamble expresses constitutional values is flawed. Children can also learn these values from Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights, and the National Anthem, all of which are equally important for holistic development under NEP-2020.Check the official statement below-The Preamble has been removed from all new textbooks, including those for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and ""World Around Us."" Previously, it was included in the old EVS book ""Looking Around"" and the Hindi book ""Rimjhim 3.""In the updated textbooks aligned with the NEP-2020, the Preamble remains in the Science book ""Curiosity"" and the Hindi book ""Malhar."" It has been omitted from the Social Science book ""Exploring Society: India and Beyond,"" which instead covers fundamental rights and duties. The previous editions included the Preamble in the English book ""Honey Suckle,"" the Science book, the Hindi book ""Durva,"" and all three Social Science books.The new English textbook ""Poorvi"" includes the National Anthem, while the Sanskrit textbook ""Deepakam"" features both the National Anthem and the National Song, but not the Preamble. The earlier Sanskrit book ""Ruchira"" also did not include the Preamble.","National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT) has made notable adjustments to its curriculum.
