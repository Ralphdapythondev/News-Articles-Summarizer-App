"From inane to evocative, the ‘free & colourful’ world of symbols",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-inane-to-evocative-the-free-colourful-world-of-symbols/articleshow/109637543.cms,"Ban on animals as party symbols

Advocate Manish Kumar Dwivedi, 31, had never imagined that one day he’d be contesting a Lok Sabha election. But ahead of the second phase, dressed in a kurtapyjama, he was walking around the lanes of UP’s Gautam Buddh Nagar, greeting people with folded hands. His supporters handed out pamphlets bearing his photograph and a symbol : the humble chai kettle .For the last two years, Dwivedi was part of a social campaign that voiced the concerns of small businessmen and entrepreneurs who were trapped in debt as a result of Covid lockdowns. “While big corporations often get debt waivers, there are small people who are getting no relief as they struggle to pay back bank loans and credit card bills. Who will speak for them?” Dwivedi asked.In order to push for a waiver and extension of time for repayments, Dwivedi and his team wrote to multiple political parties and MPs, but no one responded, he says. That’s when the group decided to enter the arena of politics. In fact, the Akhil Bharatiya Parivar Party had plans to contest all the 543 seats. All of them are first-time contenders, and come from various walks of life. The idea of the symbol, he pointed out, was crowdsourced as they asked people for suggestions. It not only represented a symbol of livelihood, but also was a barb at PM Modi’s ‘chaiwallah’ image, he said. “The symbol was a way of saying: hamein sirf chai nahi chahiye, poori ketli chahiye (we don’t want just the tea, we want the whole kettle).”The chai kettle is one of the many symbols that have been adopted by candidates like Dwivedi in the ongoing elections. From daily household items that the aam aadmi uses in kitchens to aspirational gear and gadgets, they’re all in the fray. And while they were first introduced to reach out to the people at a time when the literacy rate stood at a mere 16%, they’re still as relevant, with party factions even going to court to claim them after a split.Unlike recognised political parties, Independent candidates choose from a list of ‘free’ symbols that the Election Commission updates frequently. These include the likes of grapes, dumbbells, vacuum cleaners, batter, and more. In fact, for decades, they’ve been drawn by one person. Draftsman M S Sethi was hired by the ballot committee back in 1950 and retired in 1992. Armed with an HB pencil and paper, over the years, he doodled the images, which became the mainstay of Indian elections. While he passed away in the 2000s, his drawings continue to find their way to voting machines, posters, and households.The symbols themselves might be minimalistic and resemble hand-drawn sketches, the narratives behind them are much more complex.For lawyer Yusuf Ali Khan, contesting from Rajasthan’s Churu, choosing a ‘baby walker’ as a symbol was about making a point. “In Marwari, we call it ‘rerula’, and it represents something using which a baby learns to walk. Similarly, I want to help my community walk on its own feet,” Khan says.Khan, who contested the 2003 and 2008 assembly elections, says he had no plans to contest the Lok Sabha polls. Then, he heard that Congress had not fielded a single Muslim candidate in Rajasthan.“We are 9% of the state’s population, but have no voice. I want to change that,” Khan points out, adding that increasing access to education and scholarship opportunities are his topmost priority.Meanwhile, social worker Niranjan Singh Rathore is using his ‘belt’ symbol to tell people in Taranagar about his intentions. “Koi bhi kaam karne se pehle, kamar kasni padti hai. We need a belt for that,” he says.Belonging to a Scheduled Tribe, he says that while govts have come and gone, the benefits of social justice reforms and reservations still haven’t reached certain regions and sections. Armed with data that shows the lack of representation, he is going door to door, telling people to buckle up and demand change. These polls will be his ‘first and last’ election, Rathore says.Some are going out of their way to make sure the public doesn’t forget the symbol on the day of voting. In a move that grabbed many eyeballs, Aligarh’s Pandit Keshav Dev walked around in his constituency wearing a garland of slippers, his chosen symbol.Chennai South’s V Sivakumar, contesting on the symbol of dumbbells, hasn’t attempted anything similar yet. And for Lakhimpur’s Deba Nath Pait, it might be nearly impossible to parade with a ‘fountain’. But as they say, elections can spring many surprises.Animals and birds were banned as election symbols by EC in 1991, following protests by multiple activists. This was because parties often paraded the animals in rallies, painted them with slogans, or even slaughtered them to oppose the party in question. The only exceptions to this today are the elephant (BSP), the lion (MGP) and the rooster (Naga People’s Front).","Independent candidates choose from a list of ‘free’ symbols that the Election Commission updates frequently.

Can NOTA be a fictional candidate?

However, it agreed to entertain the petition after senior advocate Gopal Shankaranarayanan said BJP candidate in Surat got elected unopposed as others in the fray withdrew. Had BJP nominee contested with NOTA as a fictional candidate, then people's mandate would have been known, the counsel said.SC issued notice to EC and sought its response to the petition. Khera said in 2018, state election commissions in Maharashtra and Haryana had issued notifications making NOTA a fictional candidate and had said that if NOTA secured more votes than other candidates, then the election would be declared void.The petition, filed through advocate Shweta Mazumdar, said SC had introduced NOTA option for voters in its 2013 judgment in People's Union for Civil Liberties case, and that Khera was trying to take the decision forward from an idealistic notion to the ground level.However, NOTA has not been a popular option in Indian elections. In the 2019 LS elections, NOTA garnered a meagre 1.06% of votes, lower than 1.08% in the 2014 polls. In 2019, Bihar recorded highest NOTA vote share of 2%, followed by Andhra (1.54%) and Chhattisgarh (1.44%). In 2014, Meghalaya polled maximum NOTA votes at 2.8%, followed by Chhattisgarh (1.83%) and Gujarat (1.76%).In this scenario, Khera's prayer seeking to countermand an election in a constituency if NOTA secured the highest votes appeared far-fetched. He said if NOTA won, fresh elections should be conducted and all candidates who lost to NOTA should be debarred from contesting polls for five years.Khera said EC must publicise NOTA as a fictional candidate and make voters aware about casting their votes responsibly after evaluating whether any of the candidates deserved their vote.","Supreme Court agrees to examine a tricky, yet interesting, issue raised by motivational speaker and author Shiv Khera.

Except for some stray incidences, the election passed off peacefully with no incident of violence reported anywhere so far.There was an allegation from the opposition that the ruling BJP and TIPRA Motha didn't allow polling agents at the maximum booths of Khowai, Kamalpur, Kumarghat and Dharmanagar and their supporters were prevented from reaching the polling stations in a few places.The internally displaced Bru people, who are now Tripura residents, marked a significant milestone by casting their inaugural votes for the Lok Sabha election in Tripura on Friday.As many as 12 resettlement camps were instituted in Tripura to facilitate the permanent resettlement of the Bru community, where 17,524 eligible voters reside.Among these camps, Bruhapara, situated in the Ambassa subdivision under Dhalai district, saw 1,145 voters exercising their franchise for the first time in the Lok Sabha election at the Haduklau Para English Medium SB School as residents of Tripura.

With door-to-door campaigning , help desks, and voter awareness initiatives, Bengaluru’s tech corridor in Mahadevapura, part of Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency, witnessed a concerted effort to maximise voter turnout on Friday.As of 5pm, Mahadevapura assembly segment had reported 50.1% voter turnout.The tech hub, spread along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and other parts of Mahadevapura, known for its relatively low voter participation in the past, was the focus of attention as political parties aimed to mobilise the IT crowd before the weekend.As polling day coincided with the eve of a weekend, parties left no stone unturned to encourage voters to exercise their franchise.Rithika Agnishwar, overseeing BJP candidate PC Mohan’s campaign strategy, said, “Throughout our campaign, the first call was for people to get out and vote in large numbers.” Those handling Congress candidate Mansoor Ali Khan’s campaign had also stressed the same earlier.Given that IT employees often opt for long weekend getaways, party workers pulled out all the stops to bring them to the polling stations . Multiple booth-level workers from Congress and BJP said they conducted door-to-door campaigns in the past month, distributing pamphlets and urging voters to cast their ballots first, while also canvassing for their candidates.To reach residents in apartments, party workers sought permission and organised meetings and camps on such premises. Weekends were dedicated to campaigning in apartments and reaching out to techies. Voting messages were sent through apartment WhatsApp groups and social media campaigns.Political parties ensured their deployed workers — at a distance from the polling booth, as permitted by the Election Commission — remained hydrated and energised, serving them breakfast, lunch, and drinks through the day.Partha Roy, a 43-year-old director at Mask and resident of Ramagondanahalli, said, “It’s our responsibility to exercise our vote, regardless of the parties’ campaigns. I’ve been voting since I turned 18 and have never missed it.”Tiu Hazra, 33, a techie from Marathahalli, called getting their finger inked the “basic responsibility of every citizen”.Resident welfare associations (RWAs) also played a role, adopting measures such as screening on how to vote and providing shuttles to nearby polling stations.Ahead of the elections, residential communities across the area took proactive measures. For instance, a dedicated team of 15 volunteers worked for months in several apartments at Brookefield.Another such initiative was the ‘voters’ help desk’ set up at the front gate of Purva Fountain Square, a 1,200-flat apartment complex. A team of four volunteers was stationed at the desk, helping residents figure out their polling booths and providing guidance.“One of the reasons for low voter turnout is the technical issues people face with the EC website, whether it is for registration or checking names. It seems not very voter-friendly. The second reason is people’s reluctance when it comes to voting. That’s why we started this campaign, which our neighbouring apartments Rohan Vasantha and Purva Riviera also adopted,” said Piyush Bansal, a resident of Purva Fountain Square.At Knight Bridge, an apartment association with around 300 flats, manager Ajay Nath said, “To make it easier for voters, we even brought slips from govt schools for residents to cast their votes. We also helped them figure out their polling stations.”Several weeks ago, the association also held a screening on how to apply for voter cards and other IDs, successfully generating more than 40 new voter IDs. Natraj S, manager of Gopalan Enclave comprising 500 flats, said chocolates were distributed to those going to cast vote.","As of 5pm, Mahadevapura assembly segment had reported 50.1% voter turnout.

Two from Gujarat won uncontested in India’s first Lok Sabha polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/two-from-gujarat-won-uncontested-in-indias-first-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/109638717.cms,"This election season in Gujarat BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal ’s uncontested victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha election from the Surat seat has stolen the spotlight. Yet, the pages of electoral history unveil two more tales of unopposed triumphs.Flashback to India’s maiden general election of 1951, when Gujarat was part of the Bombay State: Rupaji Bhavji Parmar of the Congress clinched an uncontested win from the Panchmahals-cum-Baroda East seat, while Major General Himmatsinhji Jadeja secured a similar victory for the Congress from the Halar seat in Saurashtra.During the 1951 general election , the Bombay State had 37 Lok Sabha seats, including 14 from Gujarat, six from Saurashtra and two from Kutch. Among the 14 seats in Gujarat, single-seat constituencies encompassed Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Mehsana East, Mehsana West, Kheda North, Kheda South, Baroda West, and Panchmahal, Surat and Ahmedabad had two seats each. Interestingly, a total of 10 candidates were elected unopposed across the country. In addition to the two Congress candidates from Bombay State, candidates from Visakhapatnam, Coimbatore, Mehbubnagar, Yadgir, Bilaspur, Shahdol Dheere, Muzaffarnagar, and Raigarh Phulba seats were also elected unopposed. Seven Congress candidates, two independent candidates, and one Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP) candidate were elected unopposed to the first Lok Sabha.Political analyst Kirit Pathak said, “Major General Himmatsinhji Jadeja was made India’s first deputy defence minister. He went on to become the first lieutenant governor of Himachal Pradesh. Apart from being an elected Parliamentarian, Himmatsinhji was a first-class cricketer. He was the cousin brother of Duleepsinhji and the nephew of Ranjitsinhji — both renowned figures in Test cricket.”Returning to the present, the recent uncontested win of BJP’s Mukesh Dalal arose from the rejection of Congress candidate Nilesh Kumbhani’s nomination form. Allegations of forged signatures led to the dismissal of Kumbhani’s candidacy, and similar charges led to the rejection of Congress’ substitute candidate Suresh Padsala’s nomination form, too.","BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal ’s uncontested victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha election from the Surat seat has stolen the spotlight.
