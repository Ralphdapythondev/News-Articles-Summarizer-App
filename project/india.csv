AHMEDABAD: Despite the perilous journey and a series of deaths of illegal Indian immigrants trying to cross the border, the lure of a life in the US, especially among Gujaratis, remains strong.During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada. Of these, Indians constituted 90,415, US Customs and Border Protection (US-CBP) data shows.Of this total, roughly 50% were from Gujarat, sources in Indian agencies tracking illegal immigration said. It could also be said that 10 Indians were arrested every hour, the sources said. Also, 43,764 were arrested at the US border with Canada, in the north, making it the highest number of Indians caught at this border till now.The data reveals a slight decline from the previous year's total of 32 lakh people, and in the number of Indians caught on the Mexico route . In FY 2023, the number of illegal Indian immigrants caught was 96,917. In 2024, fewer Indians (25,616) were caught at the US-Mexico border; this number in US FY 2023 was 41,770.""People have stopped using the donkey route via Mexico due to two key reasons. One is that they would be kept in Dubai or Turkey for some time before being taken to Mexico. US agencies, over the past few years, have been keeping sharp vigil on illegal immigrants staying in those countries and have broken links in the human smuggling chain,"" a source in the immigration network said.A source said, ""Gujaratis, too, began choosing Canada over Mexico as they could easily hire a taxi and cross over to the US. Recently, US authorities have tightened vigil on this border. Such immigrants are usually sent to Canada as most of them carry a Canadian visitor visa. However, the immigrants try again after some time on the same route.""Sources also said that people caught at the border may be very few compared to those who actually manage to sneak into the US.","During US FY 2024 - October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 - 29 lakh illegal immigrants were caught trying to enter the country through Mexico and Canada.

Khajuraho Temples: What will you say of Khajuraho temples: Bombay HC to Customs department,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-will-you-say-of-khajuraho-temples-bombay-hc-to-customs-department/articleshow/114561057.cms,"Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Criticising Customs department for confiscating nude artworks of Francis Newton Souza and Akbar Padamsee on the ground that such "" obscene material "" is prohibited for import, Bombay high court asked if Customs officials can apply their own notion of what is obscenity. ""At this rate, what will you say of Khajuraho temples ?"" Justice Mahesh Sonak asked the Customs' advocate.On Monday, a bench of Justices Mahesh Sonak and Jitendra Jain said Souza and Padamsee are world renowned artists. They said ""art ultimately reflects the mores of the society"". It may be good, bad or horrendous to some, ""but the true test of freedom of speech is we are able to appreciate... at least tolerate whatever offends us. Further, a mature society is one that learns to appreciate criticism.""In June and October 2022, three nude drawings of Padamsee and four of Souza, titled 'Lovers', were purchased at auction houses Rosebery's in London and Lyon and Turnbull in Scotland. When they reached Mumbai in April 2023, Customs seized them. The petitioner, B K Polimex India Pvt Ltd, wrote for their release and provided certificates of art galleries Grosvenor in London and Sakshi in India. After a show-cause notice as to why the drawings should not be destroyed and a personal hearing, the July 1 order was passed and Rs 50,000 penalty imposed.The petitioner's advocate Shreyas Shrivastava complained that Customs had ""not even relied on experts' opinion"". Customs' advocate Jitendra Mishra said ""they are prohibited goods falling under the category of obscene material"".When HC enquired if Customs can ban something in terms of obscenity, Mishra said it relied on a 1964 notification issued under the Customs Act that gives power to prohibit import for the purpose of maintenance of public order and standards of decency or morality.Shrivastava then said these drawings are publicly available, and even on National Gallery of Modern Art 's website. The judges recalled the ban on the book, 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', and standards applied by Supreme Court while deciding the matter. ""I don't know if anybody in India could afford it. If they tried to import Michaelangelo's David, you'll say it is obscene? Because it is completely nude. Not even a fig leaf,"" said Justice Sonak.Shrivastava said Souza was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim International Award and Padamsee with Padma Shri.Shrivastava said Souza and Padamsee faced such scrutiny in the past too. In 1979, 62 drawings of Souza's were confiscated by Delhi Customs, adding, ""the matter went up to Parliament...Customs conceded it is not obscene."" Padamsee was tried under IPC 292 (obscenity) and acquitted by a magistrate court.","Customs confiscated nude artworks of Francis Newton Souza and Akbar Padamsee. Justices Mahesh Sonak and Jitendra Jain said ""art ultimately reflects the mores of the society"" The judges recalled the ban on the book 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', and standards applied by Supreme Court.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114561077,imgsize-1028992,width-400,resizemode-4/114561077.jpg"

(PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Indian High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma , recently expressed deep concerns about the harsh realities faced by Indian students pursuing higher education in Canada. Speaking to PTI, Verma highlighted issues such as substandard living conditions, underemployment , and the rising influence of Khalistani elements in the country.Verma pointed out that many students, who come from well-off families, are often forced to live in cramped spaces, with eight students sharing a single room.Despite their expectations of a promising academic journey, they end up enrolled in institutions that offer minimal classes, leading them to work low-wage jobs just to make ends meet.""A whole week they work at a store, as a daily wager,"" Verma said, referring to students’ reliance on part-time jobs rather than focusing on their education. He added that many students, despite their qualifications, are compelled to take on jobs as cab drivers or other odd roles, diverging from their original aspirations.Verma also raised concerns about the social situation in Canada, particularly the influence of Khalistani elements on young students. He noted that non-Khalistani students are being threatened and even pressured into joining gangs. ""Many innocent children who went there became criminals, gangsters, Khalistani criminals,"" he said, emphasizing that these students are being negatively influenced by local Khalistani groups.The High Commissioner's comments come amid rising tensions between India and Canada, with an increasing number of Indian parents expressing anxiety over their children’s safety and future prospects abroad.","Indian High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma, recently expressed deep concerns about the harsh realities faced by Indian students pursuing higher education in Canada.

Good day in Indo-Pacific: US welcomes India-China deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-day-in-indo-pacific-us-welcomes-india-china-deal/articleshow/114556768.cms,"The United States has welcomed India’s LAC agreement with China that ended the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, with American ambassador Eric Garcetti saying the US has always supported India’s efforts to maintain its strategic interests and respect for its borders.The agreement had been endorsed by PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in their first official meeting in 5 years in Russia on Wednesday, with Modi saying stable relations between the 2 countries will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity.Amid speculation over how the US might react to the development, which could potentially at least lead to an India-China détente, Garcetti also told TOI, “India and the US want a calm world, without conflicts and threats and it’s a good day in the Indo-Pacific when any resolution of conflict is reached as in this breakthrough”.Indian officials have said in the past that Washington helped India with quick intelligence sharing, using US equipment, during the standoff. Garcetti mentioned the border agreement, which was announced by India on Monday, while talking about the possible role that India can play in bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to an end, especially after Modi’s back-to-back visits to Moscow and Kyiv in July and August. The ambassador was making the point that territorial integrity as a principle of international law is sacrosanct and applicable to all corners of the world.“We welcome the peacemakers, including PM Modi and minister Jaishankar. We welcome the focus on a war that isn’t only European but is global. You don’t have to be in eastern Europe to feel the impact of this war. Any human being should feel the impact of hundreds of thousands of lives lost in an unnecessary, unwarranted war of aggression that violated the most fundamental principles of international relations with respect to border,’’ said the ambassador.“As we celebrate the breakthrough at the LAC where India held a line on this principle, and we supported them, we believe that’s the principle not just for one part of the world but all parts of the world,’’ added Garcetti.While he welcomed India’s role as possible peacemaker in Ukraine, he also said playing that role isn’t easy as one has to spend political capitaland corner friends and enemies alike. “But if India can open more doors, help us all impress upon Russia the importance of peace and of non-aggression, then I think that’s a welcome engagement. As I always say, India sometimes opens doors we can’t, and we open doors when India can’t. That’s what makes this relationship so magical. At its very best, we are able to do things we can’t do on our own. Not just for each other, but for the world,’’ said Garcetti.Talking about India’s strategic autonomy in July this year, Garcetti had famously said that there’s no such thing in times of conflict. He continues to maintain though that his remarks were not linked to Modi’s visit to Russia, which had sparked a wave of outrage in the US and Europe for its timing.",US ambassador Eric Garcetti said the US has always supported India’s efforts to maintain its strategic interests and respect for its borders.

India-Canada ties: 'The onus is on Trudeau to clean up the mess',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-canada-ties-the-onus-is-on-trudeau-to-clean-up-the-mess/articleshow/114546724.cms,"The India-Canada diplomatic spat has escalated to unprecedented levels as New Delhi recalled six of its diplomats including the high commissioner, and expelled as many Canadian envoys. The diplomatic clash started from Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ’s decision to publicly accuse India of being allegedly involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani separatist leader, last year without providing “hard evidentiary proof” to India.Joe Adam George, a national security analyst on South Asia affairs, has put the onus of deteriorating bilateral ties on Canadian PM Trudeau. Writing on the latest diplomatic row in National Post, a Canadian newspaper, George argues that the Trudeau government's handling of the diplomatic spat with India has been misguided and counterproductive. The author contends that instead of tactfully addressing India's concerns about alleged transnational repression activities, Trudeau chose to publicly accuse India without providing sufficient evidence, further straining the already fragile relationship between the two countries.The article highlights the importance of recognizing India's priorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, particularly the country's zero-tolerance policy on issues such as terrorism and separatism. The author points out that India faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location and history, and that the Modi government has taken decisive actions to address these concerns, such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.The piece also delves into the issue of Khalistani separatism , which New Delhi alleges is being promoted by extremists in Canada with support from Pakistan. The author argues that by appeasing Khalistani extremists, the Trudeau government is not only undermining Indian interests but also risking the lives of innocent Sikhs who have no interest in the militant movement.“By siding with Khalistani extremists, Ottawa is conflating separatist militancy with legitimate religion and risking the lives of innocent Sikhs,” said George, emphasizing the Trudeau government's failure to recognize the complex history of Khalistan militancy. The UK's Bloom Review, commissioned last year, warned that Khalistani activists have exploited government ignorance, brainwashed youth, and raised funds to support their separatist cause. George points out that Trudeau’s actions are not rooted in ignorance but in “wilful blindness” for partisan gain, despite decades of warnings from New Delhi.""Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Pentagon official, accused Trudeau of sparking an international crisis by “mischaracterizing” and “politicizing” American intelligence to justify his allegations that India had a hand in the Nijjar assassination. Rubin added that Trudeau, like his father, Pierre Trudeau, has not only permitted Khalistan militancy to thrive in Canada but also transformed the country into a hub for terrorism and terror financing,"" the article said.Trudeau's decision to engage in a diplomatic spat with India was a grave error in judgment, irrespective of the purported missteps of the Modi administration. This ill-advised move has unintentionally refocused attention on the Canadian government's leniency concerning international meddling and cross-border criminal activities, which are causing harm to both Canada and its partners, the article added.As per George, Trudeau's actions have served to highlight the very issues he likely sought to downplay, casting a shadow on his administration's ability to effectively address these pressing concerns. The unintended consequences of this diplomatic misstep may have far-reaching implications for Canada's relationships with its allies and its reputation on the global stage.The author concludes by emphasizing India's growing importance in geopolitics and the need for Trudeau to forge a fresh path forward with New Delhi if he expects cooperation in the ongoing investigation.""India is no longer a nominal player in geopolitics. It will let its relationship with Canada disintegrate if it must. The onus is on Trudeau to clean up the mess he created by forging a fresh path forward with New Delhi if he expects it to co-operate in the investigation,"" George said.","The India-Canada diplomatic spat has escalated to unprecedented levels as New Delhi recalled six of its diplomats including the high commissioner, and expelled as many Canadian envoys.

NEW DELHI: Mahayuti allies in Maharashtra , after a marathon meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, have narrowed down their differences on seat sharing to barely 12 seats, mainly in Mumbai and adjoining areas, and also took a joint pledge to stem rebellions and ensure compliance of the agreements reached among them to avoid ""friendly contests"".BJP, Shiv Sena (Shinde) and NCP (Ajit Pawar) decided to keep the decision on the 12 seats, essentially a bone of discord between BJP and Sena, hanging until close to the last day of filing papers so that those who might feel cheated don't bolt out.Sources said BJP might get to contest over 155 seats.Sena share may be in the 80-85 region, what is somewhat lower than the tally it had in mind. The rest of the seats would go to NCP (Ajit). The allies have so far released a list for 182 seats - BJP (99), Shiv Sena (45), and NCP (38) - but they are yet to announce nominees in the remaining 106 seats.After BJP released its first list of 99 candidates last Sunday, Sena workers opposed its candidates in at least four seats - Kalyan East, Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Murbad. It was learnt that state functionaries assured Shah of adherence to "" coalition dharma "" and stick to the formula on the basis of which seat-sharing arrangements have been made. They also assured no support to rebels.There was also an understanding, sources said, that controversial NCP leader Nawab Malik would not be fielded as BJP and Sena expressed discomfort in view of charges against him. His daughter Sana Malik , however, is likely to contest as an NCP nominee.

Baramulla ambush resembles past attacks on J&K military convoys

Srinagar: Two soldiers of 18 Rashtriya Rifles and two porters were killed in a terrorist ambush on a military truck carrying supplies near the Nagin area of Botapathri along the LoC, 11km from Gulmarg in north Kashmir's Baramulla district on Thursday evening.Three more RR men and two porters were wounded in the fourth terrorist attack since the new coalition government led by CM Omar Abdullah assumed office in J&K on October 16, though the three-phase assembly elections held from September 18 to October 1 concluded peacefully without major violence.The Union territory registered an uptick in terrorist attacks and counterterrorism operations this year. The latest deaths brought the total number of security force fatalities to 24 since May 4 - 18 in Jammu region and six in Kashmir. At least 20 terrorists have also been killed. ""This surge in violence is alarming and deserves unconditional condemnation,"" CM Omar said, offering condolences to the families of those killed. ""I also pray for the complete and swift recovery of the injured.""Earlier in the day, a barber from UP was wounded in an attack in Pulwama district. On Sunday, seven employees of a tunnel-construction company were killed in Ganderbal district, while a 30-year-old migrant worker from Bihar was abducted and killed in Shopian district Friday.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the attacks and expressed hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded. The ambush occurred between two security checkpoints on the route to Botapathri, 5km from the LoC. The pattern resembled previous attacks on military convoys in J&K, including an ambush on two IAF vehicles on May 4 in Poonch district that resulted in the death of Corporal Vikky Pahade. Four soldiers, including a JCO, and a J&K police constable were killed in an ambush on a military patrol truck in the remote village of Badnota in Kathua district on July 8.Last year, similar attacks in Poonch and Rajouri districts on Dec 21 and November 22 claimed the lives of nine soldiers, including two captains.",Two soldiers of 18 Rashtriya Rifles and two porters were killed in a terrorist ambush on a military truck carrying supplies.

"India, China begin troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-begin-troop-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/114559524.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops have kicked off the process to disengage in phases at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh , even as defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said `a broad consensus’ has been achieved to restore the `ground situation’ in certain areas based on the principles of equal and mutual security.“The dismantling of temporary posts and structures erected at the two face-off sites after May 2020 is now taking place in a controlled manner as part of the modalities worked out by the tactical commanders on the ground,” a source told TOI.“The dismantling and pullback by the rival troops will take around a week or so. The local commanders will then verify it physically on the ground before the coordinated patrolling begins,” he added.As per the new India-China pact on “patrolling arrangements” announced on Monday, Chinese troops will no longer block Indian soldiers at the “Bottleneck” area in the strategically-located Depsang Plains , which is around 18-km inside what India considers its own territory.“Indian troops will also not block Chinese patrols in the region. The two armies will inform each other of the date and time of their patrols in advance to avoid face-to-face confrontations. The aim is to ensure no clashes and violence takes place,” the source said.The Indian side is hopeful that its troops will now be able to go right up to their patrolling points (PPs) 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in Depsang, the crucial table-top plateau located at an altitude of 16,000-feet towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) and Karakoram Pass in the north.Similarly, the disengagement is also underway at the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south, where the People’s Liberation Army has erected some tents on Indian territory.The new patrolling pact, however, is limited to Depsang and Demchok and does not include the “buffer zones” created earlier in eastern Ladakh. The no patrol buffer zones, varying from 3-km to 10-km largely on the Indian side of the LAC , were created after troop disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last being established in Sept 2022. “The question of patrolling in the buffer zones will be taken up later,” the source said.In his first comments on the “significant development” in the border imbroglio, Singh said, “India and China have been involved in talks both at diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Pursuant to the talks, broad consensus has been achieved to restore the ground situation based on the principles of equal and mutual security.”“The consensus achieved includes patrolling and grazing (cattle) in traditional areas. This is the power of engaging in continuous dialogue because sooner or later, solutions will emerge,” he added, speaking at the Army’s Chanakya Defence Dialogue here.While the new pact will lead to disengagement at Depsang Plains and near Demchok, the subsequent process of de-escalation and de-induction of forward deployed troops, which is imperative for the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020, is still nowhere on the horizon yet.At the event, Singh said ‘development’ and ‘security’ are often viewed from separate perspectives, but are actually deeply interconnected and mutually reinforcing. “Defence spending, military infrastructure and national security can significantly affect economic growth and resource allocation, even in non-war periods or in peacetime,” he said.The govt’s consistent efforts to attain ‘Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance)’ has directly linked the defence sector with the nation’s development. “If defence had been recognised as an integral component of development and studied more comprehensively in the past, India might have achieved self-reliance in the sector much earlier. The prolonged dependency on imports can be attributed, in part, to the lack of a coordinated approach between defence and development,” he said.",Indian and Chinese troops have kicked off the process to disengage in phases at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh.

NDA MPs call on Birla, lodge protest against Venugopal

NEW DELHI: Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Thursday cited ""personal exigencies"" to skip Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting, which soon led to a fight between the panel's head K C Venugopal and NDA members who accused him of taking unilateral decisions and proceeded to lodge a protest with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.The committee's proceedings remained deadlocked even during its second sitting, where the Trai chairperson appeared briefly, amid NDA members' demand that Venugopal allow a vote on agenda items like summoning the heads of regulatory bodies, something that was opposed by MPs from Congress and its allies.Venugopal deferred the meet after Buch's no-show.The confrontation escalated when leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge joined in. ""Why is Madhabi Buch reluctant to answer questions... Who is behind the plan to protect her from being answerable to PAC?"" Rahul said on X.The PAC has constitutional right to summon any officer in connection with any govt investigation, Kharge posted.The feud over Buch started as soon as Congress-led opposition made public its intent to question the Sebi chief over allegations by Hindenburg that she did not conduct a thorough probe into “market manipulation” by Adani group, prime target of the short-seller, as well as her personal dealings involving “role conflict”. BJP opposed the plan by saying PAC’s mandate was limited to examining utilisation of funds by the market regulator and that Congress, through its MP K C Venugopal, was seeking to misuse the forum for partisan ends.Sources said Buch, in one of her communications to the PAC chairperson, referred to the Hindenburg issue and made some points. Some opposition members of the committee were left surprised as the panel has so far made no official mention of the contentious issue.On Thursday, Venugopal turned down the demand for taking a vote on summoning Buch by saying that there could not be any voting on subjects already approved by the committee, keeping open the possibility of calling Buch again, sources said.During the afternoon sitting, BJP member Nishikant Dubey cited parliamentary rules to move a motion to drop five of the 161 subjects selected by the committee for its annual agenda, and called for a vote. He said these subjects fell outside the PAC’s remit. With NDA members in majority in the panel, the chairperson did not allow the motion. He then called off the meeting amid protests by ruling alliance members. NDA members called on Birla and lodged a formal protest against Venugopal.As the panel met first at 11am, heated words were exchanged between the two sides. Venugopal read out from Buch’s letter amid the din and immediately postponed the proceedings.Venugopal indicated his disapproval of the Sebi chief skipping the meeting, noting that Buch had confirmed her presence after her earlier request for an exemption was denied. “Considering a woman’s request, we thought it better to postpone today’s meeting for another day,” he said.PAC member and BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said there were many standing committees which reviewed performance of bodies such as Sebi, RBI & Trai: “Your (Venugopal) own words are ‘suo motu’. How did you decide? PAC’s job is to consider CAG reports. We have this information from reliable sources that CAG made no mention of Sebi. This conduct is unparliamentary. Conduct of the chairperson in the way he adjourned, did not allow us to speak... (he) walked out (which) shows he has extraneous political considerations.”Venugopal strongly rebutted the claim by showing committee reports on Sebi from the past. He showed two reports on Sebi from the 15th Lok Sabha when BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi was PAC chairman, arguing that the reports were not on any CAG audit para. To BJP’s claims about unilateral agenda setting, Venugopal is said to have read out Parliament bulletins and also circulars, arguing the agenda was set by the members.","Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch cited ""personal exigencies"" to skip Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting.

According to the MoPR this is the first time that localised weather forecasts will be available at the gram panchayat level, supported by IMD’s expanded sensor coverage.Panchayati Raj minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh said connecting gram panchayats to realtime weather forecasting is a “key step towards empowering the Indian economy and enhancing the ease of living for rural populations”. He also highlighted that this will help reduce agricultural losses due to weather uncertainties.Earth sciences minister Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that this initiative is part of the government’s broader commitment to strengthen the rural economy . “This initiative will also ensure that farmers and common citizens receive timely updates, helping them make informed decisions to improve both productivity and safety,” he added.The forecasts will be disseminated through the Panchayati Raj ministry ’s digital platforms: e-GramSwaraj, which enables efficient governance, project tracking, and resource management; the Meri Panchayat App, which fosters community engagement by allowing citizens to interact with local representatives and report issues; and Gram Manchitra, a spatial planning tool that provides geospatial insights for development projects.“Gram Panchayats will receive daily updates on temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and cloud cover, empowering them to make critical decisions in agriculture, such as planning sowing, irrigation, and harvesting activities,” MoPR highlighted in a statement.“These tools will also strengthen disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning. Furthermore, SMS alerts will be sent to Panchayat representatives regarding extreme weather events like cyclones and heavy rainfall, ensuring immediate action to protect lives, crops, and property,” the ministry explained in the statement.Vivek Bharadwaj, secretary, MoPR, also shared that the ministry is working on a pilot to train locals at the panchayat level to be the first line of response in a disaster situation. MoPR will be collaborating with the National Disaster Management Authority to start a pilot in 27 districts across the country where locals will be trained and provided with some specialised equipment to help create a localised disaster response system at the grassroots.",The initiative is projected by government as a measure for boosting local-level governance and making villages climate-resilient.

Crude Palm Oil: No relief for consumers as global prices of edible oils spike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-relief-for-consumers-as-global-prices-of-edible-oils-spike/articleshow/114559274.cms,"NEW DELHI: Consumers will have to live with the increase in edible oil prices for the next few months as there has been a spike in global prices after the government increased import duties on inbound shipments.Government sources said there is hardly any chance of reducing the import duty and this would continue to help the country move towards self-sufficiency in edible oil.Industry sources also said farmers need to get a good price for oilseeds, and for that, the current regime of import duty needs to continue.The government has increased import duties on crude palm, soybean , and sunflower to 27.5% from 5.5%. The duty on refined edible oil has also been raised to 35.75% from 13.75%.The global prices of crude palm, soybean, and sunflower have risen by approximately 10.6%, 16.8%, and 12.3%, respectively, in the last one month. These three oils constitute the major share of the country's edible oil import basket. At present, India meets around 60% of its edible oil demand through imports.As per Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA), land prices of crude palm, soybean and sunflower on Thursday were $1,145, $1,160 and $1,165 per tonne, respectively. This is an increase of 32%, 18% and 26%, respectively, compared to last year.The data collated by the price monitoring cell of the consumer affairs department show that the modal or most common prices across centres of mustard, sunflower and soybean increased to Rs 181, Rs 148 and Rs 143 per litre, respectively, on Thursday. Before the hike in import duty on Sept 16, the per litre modal prices of mustard, sunflower, and soybean were Rs 135, Rs 126, and Rs 143.Prices of mustard oil have gone up despite India not importing any of it due to increase in prices of other edible oils. “When there is price pressure on the other major edible oils, it’s bound to have an impact on the entire basket,” said a government official. India is the world’s second-largest consumer of edible oil and the biggest importer of vegetable oil.BV Mehta, executive director of SEA, said that while the immediate price rise seems significant, there has been very little change if seen across the past few years. “If we want to make ourselves self-sufficient in edible oil, we have to encourage farmers to bring more areas under oilseeds. That will happen only when farmers get good prices for years and we don’t go for excess import of oil.”","Global prices of crude palm, soybean, and sunflower have risen by approximately 10.6%, 16.8%, and 12.3%, respectively, in the last one month.

Kashmir: 19-year-old barber from UP shot at in south Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/19-year-old-barber-from-up-shot-at-in-south-kashmir/articleshow/114558268.cms,"SRINAGAR: A 19-year-old barber named Shubam Kumar from UP’s Bijnor suffered a gunshot wound in his right arm in a terrorist attack at Batagund village in south Kashmir ’s Pulwama district Thursday morning. Kumar was rushed to a hospital in nearby Tral, where officials confirmed he is out of danger.This marked the third targeted attack on migrant workers in Kashmir valley within a week and the sixth this year.The attack followed a pattern of recent violence , reminiscent of the mass shooting Sunday evening when Pakistani terrorists stormed a tunnel-construction company’s campsite on Srinagar-Leh highway in Ganderbal district, leaving seven people dead.The shooting claimed the lives of a doctor from Budgam district in Kashmir, an architectural engineer from Jammu, three workers from Bihar, and one each from Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. It was one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in the Union territory in 2024, following the June 9 ambush on a pilgrim bus in Reasi district of Jammu division, which killed nine people.Targeted violence against migrant workers has seen a troubling rise in Kashmir lately, evoking memories of 2022 when 29 fatalities were reported, including five Kashmiri Pandits.Earlier on Friday, the bullet-riddled body of a 30-year-old migrant worker from Bihar’s Banka district was found in a maize field in south Kashmir’s Shopian district.

'Why is Madhabi Buch reluctant?': Rahul Gandhi after Sebi chief skips PAC meeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-is-madhabi-buch-reluctant-rahul-gandhi-after-sebi-chief-skips-pac-meeting/articleshow/114557642.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday attacked Madhabi Puri Buch, the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ), for her absence from a meeting with the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Thursday. Gandhi alleged that someone was shielding Buch from being accountable to the PAC .""Why is Madhabi Buch reluctant to answer questions before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament? Who is behind the plan to protect her from being answerable to the PAC?"" Rahul Gandhi posted on X.The PAC meeting was postponed due to a ruckus that arose after Buch failed to appear before the committee. According to sources, she was expected to attend the meeting in New Delhi on Thursday. KC Venugopal , the Congress leader who chairs the PAC, informed reporters that Buch had notified him on Thursday morning about her inability to travel to Delhi.""In the first meeting of the committee itself, we decided to have a suo moto subject for review of our regulatory bodies. That is why we called SEBI, today morning for a review of SEBI. The committee branch sends the notice to the concerned people. First of all, they sought an exemption, SEBI chairperson sought an exemption from appearing before the committee which we denied. After that, she confirmed she and her team would be present on this committee... Today morning, she (SEBI chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch) informed me that she is not in a position to travel to Delhi. Considering a woman's request we thought that it is better to postpone today's meeting for another day,"" Venugopal said.BJP Leader Ravi Shankar Prasad criticized Venugopal for discussing the PAC meeting's proceedings with the media, accusing the opposition members of unparliamentary behavior. ""Generally, we don't discuss the proceedings of standing committees or PAC's meetings outside. It pains us that the chairman of the PAC, KC Venugopal, gave a byte outside. We were in the majority in the PAC meeting today. We objected to his suo moto decision to choose the subject, did he ask anyone? We had serious reservations about the procedure adopted in the PAC meeting... It was strange, he (KC Venugopal) rose suddenly and walked away,"" he said.In September, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch issued a joint statement, describing the recent allegations against them as ""false, incorrect, malicious and motivated"".","Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Madhabi Puri Buch, the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

NEW DELHI: Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the India-China pact that eases border tension between New Delhi and Beijing was the outcome of the ""power of engaging in dialogue "".He said that the consensus between both nations includes ""patrolling, grazing in traditional areas"".""India and China have been involved in talks both at the diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the LAC.A broad consensus has been achieved to restore the ground situation based on the principles of equal and mutual security. The consensus achieved includes patrolling and grazing to the traditional areas. This is the power of engaging in continuous dialogue because sooner or later solutions will emerge...,"" the defence minister while speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024.The landmark agreement India and China reached this week to end one of the longest military standoffs in recent times received the final seal of approval on Wednesday from PM Modi and President Xi Jinping , as the two held a bilateral meeting in Kazan after a gap of five years and endorsed the deal.This, according to the Indian side, will lead to a further easing of the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).As the next step forward, the two leaders agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019, and underlined the need to take relations forward from a ""strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges"".Before the PM Modi and Xi's meeting, External affairs minister S Jaishankar called it a ""positive development"" which he said would create a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border areas.The relationship between India and China, two nuclear-armed neighbours, has remained fraught with tension since the deadly clash in Galwan Valley in 2020.This incident marked a turning point, prompting India to increase scrutiny of Chinese investments and suspend several significant projects aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation.In an effort to resolve the ongoing standoff, both nations engaged in multiple rounds of corps commanders-level talks. Progress was slow, but a notable development occurred in September 2022 when both sides undertook disengagement along the LAC.Troops were withdrawn from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh, which was seen as a crucial step towards de-escalation. The establishment of buffer zones along the LAC provided a framework for potential resolutions.","India and China have been involved in talks both at the diplomatic and military levels to resolve their differences in certain areas along the LAC.
