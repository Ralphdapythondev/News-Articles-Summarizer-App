NEW DELHI: The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has released new guidelines for all medical institutions and accredited hospitals concerning the stipend structure for NBEMS trainee doctors, as well as postgraduate and undergraduate students.Earlier in April this year, the National Medical Commission (NMC) directed all medical colleges and health institutions to provide details of the stipends paid to undergraduate medical interns, postgraduate (PG) resident doctors, senior resident doctors, and PG students in super-specialty courses for the 2023-24 academic year.The institutions were required to submit these details by the end of April.While the revised stipend guidelines do not reflect significant changes for most categories of students, there is a 5% increase in the minimum payout for Post Diploma (Broad Specialty) candidates, amounting to an additional two thousand rupees for each year of study.The updated stipend for DNB trainees in 2024 remains consistent with the amounts specified in the previous notice from 2019 for both the DNB Broad Specialty (Post MBBS) and DNB Super Specialty (Post MD/MS/DNB) courses. However, there is an increase in the stipend for the DNB Broad Specialty (Post Diploma) trainees, with a revised stipend for the first and second years in 2024 compared to the 2019 notice.While the stipends for the Post MBBS (Broad Specialty) and Super Specialty (Post MD/MS/DNB) courses remain unchanged in the revised 2024 guidelines, there has been an increase in the stipends for the Post Diploma (Broad Specialty) courses. Additionally, accredited hospitals and medical institutions are required to provide a stipend to all NBEMS trainees.The National Board of Examinations (NBE) has clarified how the phrase ""basic stipend according to state government policy"" should be interpreted for trainees in different categories of states. These guidelines are applicable to both DNB (Diplomate of National Board) and FNB (Fellowship of National Board) trainees and are intended to align their stipends with those of MD/MS and DM/MCh trainees at State Government Medical Colleges.For states where the stipend paid to MD/MS and DM/MCh trainees of State Government Medical Colleges is offered as a consolidated sum, without any breakdown into basic pay and other allowances, the NBE has set specific guidelines:In such states, the stipend for DNB Broad Specialty trainees should be equal to the consolidated sum that is paid to MD/MS trainees of State Government Medical Colleges.Similarly, the stipend for DNB Super Specialty and FNB trainees should match the consolidated amount paid to DM/MCh trainees in the respective State Government Medical Colleges.In contrast, some states structure the stipend for MD/MS and DM/MCh trainees as a combination of ""Basic Pay plus various allowances,"" which may include Dearness Allowance (DA), Non-Practicing Allowance (NPA), House Rent Allowance (HRA), among others. These stipends are aligned with the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) recommendations. For such states, the NBE guidelines are as follows:The stipend for these trainees should be based on Pay Level 10 of the 7th CPC. Specifically, this means that Cell 1, 2, and 3 of Pay Level 10 in the 7th CPC pay matrix correspond to the first, second, and third year of training, respectively.For these trainees, the stipend should align with Pay Level 11 of the 7th CPC. Here, Cell 1, 2, and 3 of Pay Level 11 in the 7th CPC pay matrix are designated for the first, second, and third year of training, respectively.The notice also clarified that NBEMS-accredited hospitals have the discretion to pay their trainees a monthly stipend higher than the prescribed amount.Furthermore, trainees in the 4th, 5th, and 6th years of a Direct 6-year NBEMS course will receive a stipend equivalent to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-year trainees of a Super Specialty course, respectively, provided they have passed the DNB Part-I Examination.",The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has released new guidelines for all medical institutions and accredited hospitals concerning the stipend structure for NBEMS trainee doctors. There is a 5% increase in the minimum payout for Post Diploma (Broad Specialty) candidates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113209995,imgsize-1025484,width-400,resizemode-4/113209995.jpg"

""Research funding may eventually lead to development of patents or climate-resistant seed varieties, and therefore, it should not bear the GST burden,"" Sitharaman said.Multiple institutions including IIT-Delhi and state universities such as Anna University, Chennai received GST notices. As reported by TOI, last month, IIT-Delhi received a show-cause notice from the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Intelligence, demanding Rs 120 crore in GST on research grants it received between 2017 and 2022.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra said that the tax claim will be ""regularised"".The decision came along with a clarification for foreign airlines where GST will be exempt on import of services from a related person or any of its establishments outside India, which comes without any consideration.Asked about notices to companies such as those sent to Infosys for transactions with branches, Malhotra said that a clarification issued in June dealt with the issue. The Indian IT major had received a Rs 32,000 crore notice from DG GST Intelligence a part of which has been closed with demands for remaining years also expected to be dropped based on the clarification.",GST Council announced tax exemption for research funding for higher educational institutions and research centres established under central or state laws.

She alleged he then forced her into oral sex and molested her. ""I repeatedly asked him to stop and tried to resist it. Finally, I pushed him and ran away,"" she said, in the FIR lodged at the Budgam police station on Sept 8.IAF, on being contacted by TOI, said: ""We are aware the woman officer has lodged an FIR.

IAF is fully cooperating in the investigation.""""I was afraid and didn't know what to do as there were instances before also wherein, I was discouraged to report. He (the accused) visited my office after this incident... He behaved as if nothing happened ,"" she said. ""I can't describe the mental agony of being an unmarried girl who had joined the forces and was treated in such a heinous manner,"" she said, adding she initially lacked the courage to report the incident.When she told two women officers about the incident, they told her to complain to the higher authorities in the station, following which an inquiry was ordered. But when she objected to the accused's presence during the recording of her statement on Jan 29-30, the investigation was ""closed to hide the mistakes of the administration"".The woman officer then filed a fresh application to the internal committee (IC) of the unit. The IC was assembled only after two months. ""The bias of the station authorities to aid the sexual offender was very heart breaking,"" she said, alleging that a medical examination was not done till she insisted multiple times.The IC said the evidence was ""inconclusive"" because there was no eyewitness and closed the probe on May 15.

Don't allow BJP's plans to succeed: Omar on bail to Engineer Rashid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-allow-bjps-plans-to-succeed-omar-on-bail-to-engineer-rashid/articleshow/113239229.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A special NIA court in New Delhi on Tuesday granted interim bail to Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid, better known as Engineer Rashid (pic), till Oct 2, allowing him to campaign for the J&K polls.Additional sessions judge Chander Jit Singh had reserved his order after an in-camera hearing. ""It is a huge relief (for Rashid) after having spent over five years in jail,"" said his counsel Vikhyat Oberoi .Lodged in Tihar jail since 2019 after being held in a terror funding case, Rashid moved a plea for 3 months' interim bail to participate in campaign.Rashid, who heads Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), contested as an independent candidate from the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency and defeated National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah , earlier this year.The upcoming assembly elections- three-phase polls from Sept 18 to Oct 1 for 90 assembly seats - the first after the abrogation of Article 370, are being seen as a milestone, as Rashid's massive win over the former CM as well as Sajjad Lone of People's Conference in the Lok Sabha elections had created ripples in the Valley and changed the dynamics of electoral politics there. The victory came despite Rashid's incarceration - his sons campaigned for their father - making it even more significant, and had rattled the mainstream political parties in Kashmir. It was an indicator of the voter sentiments in the separatist landscape of the region.Both Omar and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti have alleged that Rashid is being pushed by BJP to weaken mainstream parties. Omar said: ""I feel sorry for the people of Baramulla. This bail is not to serve the people of north Kashmir but to get votes. After polls, Er Rashid will be back in Tihar...My only appeal is not to allow BJP's designs to succeed. If people want a BJP govt in J&K, then they should support AIP, PCP and Apni Party.""",Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid granted interim bail till Oct 2.

Looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, your party was not able to agree on seat-sharing policies with your alliance partner Mamata Banerjee-led TMC. You also have partners like Hindutva-based Shiv Sena. If elected, how would you effectively run a government with such a divided coalition which does not seem to agree on anything except for the removal of the Prime minister Modi"", the student asked.Rahul, addressing the larger issue of the alliance ’s vision, was quick to correct, “INDI is BJP’s framing, it’s INDIA alliance,” he said.However, the persistent student then questioned what the “A” in INDIA stood for.The brief silence then followed from Rahul. After a pause, he replied that “A” stood for “Alliance,” a moment that seemed to throw the crowd off balance.The student further asked whether it wouldn’t make it redundant to call it the INDIA alliance.Rahul did manage to clarify the ideological foundation of the INDIA bloc. “No, it’s not redundant because the whole idea of the alliance was to put across to the people of India that India is being attacked,” he said, bringing the conversation back to what the alliance stands for, describing it as a united front to challenge BJP’s monopolization of power.Critics from the ruling party were quick to pounce, painting the moment as a representation of the opposition’s broader internal confusion.This comes amid a row over Rahul's remarks where he said that today the ""fight in India is whether a Sikh person will be able to wear his turban, kada, and visit Gurdwara"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi at the center of an unexpected candid exchange with a student about the opposition’s much-touted ‘ INDIA Alliance ’ The episode, which began as a straightforward question on coalition dynamics, quickly transformed into a moment that went viral on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113231415,imgsize-502422,width-400,resizemode-4/113231415.jpg"

He then said, ""Fight (in India) is not about politics. That is superficial. The fight is about whether... he (Bhalender) as a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, wear a Kada in India, or be able to go to a gurdwara, that's what the fight is about, and not just for him, for all religions... the fight is about what type of India we are going to have.""Responding to a question on reservations and how long it would continue, Rahul said, ""We will think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place. And India is not a fair place. When you look at the financial numbers, tribals get 10 paise out of Rs 100, Dalits get Rs 5 out of Rs 100, and OBCs get a similar number. The fact of the matter is that they're not getting participation.""Rahul jibed that post-2024 polls, people stop him on the roads and tell him that their fear has vanished. He laughed while it took BJP years to spread the scare through agencies, it disappeared in a matter of seconds.In New Delhi, Congress said it is hypocritical of BJP to criticise Rahul Gandhi for his justified comments in the US when PM Modi has been going abroad and ""insulting generations of Indians"" by saying that nothing happened in India in 60 years before 2014.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said, "" BJP ecosystem is nervous and flailing because Rahul has spoken the plain truth. The 'Modi bubble' has burst. His politics of fear has failed, and nobody takes him or his band of cheerleaders seriously.

What did Rahul Gandhi say?

NEW DELHI: BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad Tuesday came out strongly on Rahul Gandhi 's tirade against the BJP during his US trip and accused the Congress leader of habitually defaming India on foreign soil. The BJP leader in particular pounced on Rahul Gandhi's statement that he intended to ""scrap reservation at the right moment"" and said it was a reflection of the Congress leader's prejudice against the idea.“Rahul Gandhi, who claimed to save the Constitution, said in America that ‘when the conditions so warrant, of fairness, we will scrap reservation’. The prejudice against reservation which Rahul Gandhi has in abundance got reflected in America.”""Rahul creates ruckus when he goes abroad"".The ex-law minister went on to say it was Rahul Gandhi's legacy to oppose reservations. "" Nehru , Rajeev, Indira were all opposed to reservations"", he said. The BJP leader also argued that it was the grand old party that was against the deprived communities while the saffron party embraced the communities by appointing an OBC prime minister, Dalit President and many more chief ministers from the backward community.The BJP leader cited leaders like Prime Minister Modi, President Murmu , Kalyan Singh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan , Uma Bharati, Gopinath Munde, Mohan Yadav , who have risen in the party and touted it as an example of the party's commitment towards the backward communities. "" We don't say, we do,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted.Ravi Shankar Prasad also targeted the INDIA bloc and asked DMK chief M K Stalin, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and leaders of the Left parties to break their silence on Gandhi's remark.""I want to warn that if Congress tries to do any tampering with the provision of reservation or scrap it, the BJP will vehemently oppose it,"" he said.Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP-Ram Vilas)’s Chirag Paswan, a BJP ally that is a key constituent in the Centre’s ruling coalition, said the LoP's statements had exposed the Congress’ mindset, and stressed that even thinking of ending the quota system was an anti-constitutional move.“Rahul Gandhi ji, let alone ending reservation, even thinking about it is a crime! Today, Rahul Gandhi’s statement has exposed the mindset of the Congress party. Congress wants, and it has been one of their priorities, to end the reservation given by Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar. Reservation is necessary to continue the constitutional system smoothly. In such a situation, let alone ending the reservation, no one can even think of tampering with that provision.”Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi who is on a trip to the US said the Congress Party would think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place, which is not the case right now. “We will think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place. And India is not a fair place,” the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha , Rahul Gandhi told students in response to a question on reservation and how long it would continue.""The problem is that 90% of India is not able to play. Go through the list of every single business leader in India. I've done it. Show me the tribal name. Show me the Dalit name. Show me the OBC name. Out of the top 200, I think there's one OBC. They're 50% of India. But we're not treating the symptom,” he said.“There are many people who come from the upper caste who say, look, what have we done wrong? Why are we being punished? So, then you think about increasing dramatically the supply of some of these things. You think about decentralising power. You think about involving many more people in the governance of our country. You think of opening up. With all due respect, I don't think any of you are ever going to become Adani or Ambani. There's a reason for that. You can't. Because those doors are closed.

No progress possible now without cybersecurity: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-progress-possible-now-without-cybersecurity-amit-shah/articleshow/113243315.cms,"NEW DELHI: As fast-paced advancements in technology cause a surge in digital transactions and online activity in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday stressed on the need for all the stakeholders including Central and state law enforcement agencies, banks and internet service providers, to come together to fight the growing risk of cybercrimes with a data-driven approach and evolving counter-strategies.Addressing an event here to mark the first Foundation Day of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), Shah said I4C has an important role in bringing all the stakeholders on one platform to deal with emerging cyber threats as initiatives like ‘Digital India’ see the number of internet subscribers grow from 25 crore in March 2014 to 95 crore in March 2024 and 46% of the world’s digital transactions volume taking place in India.“In the days to come, as the country makes significant technological advancements, I4C has an important role in ensuring the security of its technology, data and vital installations....I believe that cyber security has become an important aspect of national security...the country’s progress is not possible without it,” the home minister said as he launched four new cyber security initiatives of I4C aimed at realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a ‘Cyber Safe Bharat’.Firstly, Shah dedicated the Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre (CFMC) — a national platform that will onboard major banks, financial institutions, payment aggregators, telecom service providers, IT intermediaries and law enforcement agencies for real-time action against online financial crimes — to the nation. He suggested that CFMC use Artificial Intelligence to identify the modus operandi of cyber frauds and find ways to deal with them.Shah also inaugurated the Samanvaya Platform, a one-stop portal for data repository of cybercrime, data sharing, crime mapping, data analytics, and coordination among law enforcement agencies for investigation of cybercrimes. Cyber Commandos Program that seeks to create special wing of trained commandos in the states/UTs and Central police organisations to secure digital space, with 5,000 commandos to be readied in 5 years, was also launched.The last initiative is the creation of a national-level ‘suspect registry’ of various mule account identifiers based on the national cybercrime reporting portal, and connecting state registries with it to in strengthen the fraud risk management capabilities of the financial ecosystem. Shah said the national suspect registry will help ensure that states/UTs do not work in silos.Shah said a nationwide cyber security awareness programme is on since September 1, with over 72 TV channels, 190 FM channels, cinema halls and other platforms on board.

It's fighting back, but it was broken.""""I have seen the government of Maharashtra just being taken away from us.I've seen it with my own eyes. I've watched it, as our legislators have been bought in and hooked off and suddenly became BJP legislators. So Indian democracy has been under attack, has been very badly weakened, and now it's fighting back. And I'm confident that it'll fight back,"" Gandhi said.When asked if the election results give him more hope for democracy in India, Gandhi acknowledged that it does, but he also highlighted the importance of a level playing field for voters to make informed decisions.""Yeah, I mean, it does. But it's not good enough to say that the Indian voter is resilient and knowledgeable. Because the Indian voter is informed by a whole set of structures. So if we don't have a level playing field, the voter might be very knowledgeable and resilient. It doesn't really matter,"" he said.The opposition leader shared his own experiences, mentioning that his party fought an election with frozen bank accounts. ""We fought an election with our bank accounts frozen. I don't know any democracy where that's happened. Maybe that type of thing happened in Syria or used to happen in Iraq. But we literally sat during our election and spoke to our treasurer and he says, well, we have no money. Now, you can have a resilient voter. You still need to run campaigns. You still need to have conversations. You still need to have meetings,"" he said.""I've got 20-plus cases in me. I'm the only person in Indian history to get a prison sentence for defamation. We have a chief minister who's in jail right now. So, mean, one way of saying it is, yes, the Indian voter is very resilient, and he stands like a rock. Absolutely, he does. But the Indian voter requires an architecture to work on, which is not there,"" Gandhi said.Gandhi continued his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of portraying himself as a non-biological person with a direct link to God. ""Here's a prime minister of a modern country in the 21st century telling people that I speak to God. I'm different than everybody else. You are biological people. I'm a non-biological person. I have a direct link to God. And that for us was a game over (for the prime minister during the elections). We knew that we had defeated the prime minister,"" he said.""And then the beautiful thing was the first thing he did when he walked into the Lok Sabha , he was sworn in. He took the Constitution of India, and he placed it in his head,"" he added.""So, it was an interesting paradox. On one hand, he's destroying the Constitution. He's attacking the democratic structure. And then the Indian people have forced him to put it in his head,"" Gandhi said.","Rahul Gandhi, the leader of opposition, addressed a press conference on Wednesday in Washington.
