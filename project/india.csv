"On wife’s suggestion, CJI Chandrachud arranges screening of 'Laapataa Ladies' to promote gender sensitisation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-wifes-suggestion-cji-chandrachud-arranges-screening-of-laapataa-ladies-to-promote-gender-sensitisation/articleshow/112417045.cms,"NEW DELHI: On wife Kalpana Das ’s suggestion, CJI D Y Chandrachud on Friday arranged for an exclusive screening of acclaimed Hindi film ‘Laapata Ladies’ for the Supreme Court judges and staff but prior to that producer Aamir Khan and director Kiran Rao had a privileged preview of CJI’s Courtroom proceedings.It was Kalpana, who after watching the film, suggested to CJI Chandrachud for the screening of the film for the entire staff of the apex court as she felt that the movie conveyed a moving message on gender sensitisation.Coincidentally, in the 75th year of its establishment, the SC is observing a year-long gender sensitisation programme.It was a spectacle in the CJI’s courtroom, the largest and most ornate among all SC courtrooms. With a dozen seats separated with a barricade tape from areas crowded by lawyers, Khan dressed in a printed kurta and Rao in a blue saree over a white top, along with half a dozen their associates were seen keenly watching proceedings before the CJI and his colleague judges - J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.Security too was deployed to avoid any lawyer fan mobbing the celebrated actor. None did, as for them the court proceedings were more important. But, courtroom cameras, which usually focus on lawyers representing petitioners and respondents, were glued to Khan and Rao. So much so that, when the petitioner’s counsel was arguing, many a time he/she was not visible, though audible.After an hour or so, Khan either lost interest in the proceeding or to prepare for smooth screening or for some pressing engagement, left the courtroom, leaving Rao and two three others to continue sitting in the courtroom till 4 pm. The screening was scheduled from 4.15 pm till 6.20 pm.The SC registry informed that the judges interacted with Khan and Rao after the screening for about 15-20 minutes. Some judges did not attend. Few among them felt that close interaction with the actor and producer would not be ethical as there may be a case in future where a film involving Khan and Rao may get challenged in the SC.",CJI D Y Chandrachud arranged for an exclusive screening of acclaimed Hindi film ‘Laapata Ladies’ for the Supreme Court judges and staff.

"SC grants Sisodia bail, says trial yet to even commence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-grants-sisodia-bail-says-trial-yet-to-even-commence/articleshow/112414716.cms,"Travesty of justice if Sisodia sent back to trial court: SC

In a big relief to Aam Aadmi Party leader and former deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia , Supreme Court on Friday granted him bail in the corruption and money laundering cases related to changes in Delhi’s excise policy, and paved the way for him to come out of jail 17 months after he was arrested.“If the govt tries to forcibly put a common individual in jail who speaks against dictatorship, then the Constitution will protect them,” Sisodia told AAP supporters who waited for him outside Tihar jail gate.Noting that far from being concluded in 6-8 months, trial is yet to even commence, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said it was a fit case to grant bail as prolonged incarceration would amount to violation of his fundamental right to life and liberty which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Sisodia was arrested by CBI on Feb 6, 2023, and was subsequently taken into custody by ED on March 9.“In the present case, in the ED matter as well as the CBI matter, 493 witnesses have been named. The case involves thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitised documents. It is thus clear that there is not even the remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive [him of] his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. As observed time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial,” the court said.Though CBI/ED insisted that Sisodia be subjected to the same conditions which were imposed while granting bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who was asked not to visit his office and Delhi secretariat, the bench turned down the plea. Sisodia, in any case, resigned as minister and does not have an office.The court directed Sisodia to surrender his passport and report to the IO Mondays and Thursdays. He has to furnish bail bonds for Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount and the court also allowed the probe agency to seek cancellation of bail in case of violation of any condition, including not making any attempts to influence witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.We find that, on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not even having commenced, the appellant has been deprived of his right to speedy trial. As observed by this court, the right to speedy trial and the right to liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the high court ought to have given due weightage to this factor,” the court said, setting aside the orders of the trial court and the HC.This was the third round of litigation on Sisodia’s bail in SC which had in Oct last year rejected his plea. He made a fresh plea before the apex court after being rejected by the trial court and Delhi HC and the court disposed of his plea in June and granted him liberty to revive the petition after filing of chargesheet. Seeking rejection of the third petition for revival of his plea, CBI/ED told the bench that he must first approach the trial court and then HC and finally SC.The bench, however, rejected the plea and said it would be “travesty of justice” if he was sent back to the trial court for bail. “Relegating the appellant to again approach the trial court and thereafter the high court and only thereafter this court, in our view, would be making him play a game of snake and ladder. The trial court and the HC have already taken a view and in our view, relegating him again to the trial court and the HC would be an empty formality. In a matter pertaining to the life and liberty of a citizen which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution, a citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post,” it said.The court also found that there was no substance in CBI/ED allegations, upheld by the trial court, that the trial was getting delayed because of Sisodia who filed multiple applications.It noted that none of the applications filed by him was frivolous and the judicial record of the case belied the trial court’s finding that delay was caused by him.“It could further be seen that, though it has been submitted on behalf of the ED that hundreds of applications have been filed for supply of un-relied upon documents, the record would not substantiate the said position. Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, insofar as the present appellant is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in the ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his wife or permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on the documents, seeking permission to sign a cheque etc,” the court said.","Sisodia was arrested by CBI on Feb 6, 2023, and was subsequently taken into custody by ED on March 9. He has to furnish bail bonds for Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount.

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, India's star wrestler Vinesh Phogat , who was a strong favourite for a gold medal, was disqualified from the Paris 2024 Olympics finals on Wednesday morning.The disqualification was due to a sudden increase in her weight, which prevented her from competing against the United States' Ann Hildebrandt in the women's 50 kg wrestling final.Phogat had successfully weighed in at 49.90 kg on Tuesday morning, allowing her to compete in her first match of the day. She went on to win three bouts, including the semi-final. However, her weight unexpectedly increased to approximately 52.7 kg, resulting in her disqualification.In response, the Indian wrestling team , determined to resolve the issue, enlisted the help of Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala , a renowned sports orthopedic surgeon . Chef de Mission Gagan Narang, along with Dr. Pardiwala, Phogat's husband, physiotherapist, medical staff, and officials from the Indian Olympic Association, worked tirelessly through the night to help Phogat meet the weight requirements.Despite their best efforts, they were unable to reduce her weight in time. Reports indicate that Dr. Pardiwala emphasized that Phogat's health was paramount and that compromising her well-being was not an option.Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala is a highly esteemed expert in sports medicine. He recently performed surgery on wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and has treated many notable cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravindra Jadeja.With over two decades of experience, he currently serves as the Director of Arthroscopy and Shoulder Service at Kokilaben Hospital in Mumbai. In recognition of his contributions to arthroscopic surgery, he received the prestigious ICOS John Joyce Award in 2009.Despite this setback, Phogat's accomplishment of becoming the first Indian female wrestler to reach the Olympic finals remains a significant milestone for Indian wrestling.","Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the Paris 2024 Olympics finals on Wednesday morning.

"Explained: What is 'bail is rule, jail an exception' Supreme Court cited in Manish Sisodia case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/explained-what-is-bail-is-rule-jail-an-exception-supreme-court-cited-in-manish-sisodia-case/articleshow/112410167.cms,"But what is this principle?

Why 'twin test' of PMLA make it difficult?



Why SC quoted 'bail is rule' in Sisodia's case

When the court called for 'bail is rule' principle

NEW DELHI: After 17 months in jail, former Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia finally walked free on a regular bail . In tears, as he got a rousing welcome outside Tihar jail by party leaders Atishi, Sanjay Singh and supporters, in a cracking voice he thanked Ambedkar and the Constitution because of which, he said, he was free.Sisodia, who got multiple setbacks by lower courts during the last 17 months, finally got bail as the Supreme Court reiterated the principle of 'bail is the rule , and jail is an exception'.Sharply criticising the lower courts, the top court said, ""As observed time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial."" The bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said, ""It is high time trial courts, high courts recognise principle of bail is the rule and jail is an exception.""The 'bail is the rule, and jail is the exception' principle was first used in the 1977 landmark judgment of the 'State of Rajasthan vs Balchand alias Baliya' case.The ruling underscored that bail should be denied only in circumstances where there is a risk of the accused fleeing from justice, obstructing justice, repeating offenses, or intimidating witnesses. This concept has been cited in numerous cases since, reinforcing its importance in upholding personal liberty.""The basic rule is bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offenses or intimidating witnesses and the like by the petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court. When considering the question of bail, the gravity of the offense involved and the heinousness of the crime which are likely to induce the petitioner to avoid the course of justice must weigh with the court,"" the 1977 bench said.The discussion around bail becomes more complex in cases involving the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), especially after the March 2018 amendment. This amendment revived the 'twin conditions' under Section 45(1) of the PMLA, making it significantly harder to secure bail in money laundering cases. These conditions stipulate that when an accused in a money laundering case applies for bail, the court must first provide an opportunity for the public prosecutor to be heard.According to Section 45, no person accused of an offense under the PMLA can be released on bail unless the public prosecutor is given a chance to oppose the bail application, and the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused is not guilty of the offense and is unlikely to commit any offense while on bail. This effectively places the burden of proving innocence on the accused, complicating the bail process.Before the 2019 amendments of PMLA, if someone was accused of a crime related to money laundering, the law automatically assumed they were guilty of the original crime (called the ""scheduled offence""). The accused had to prove they were not involved in that crime to get bail.The Supreme Court emphasised that delay in trial and prolonged imprisonment are valid grounds for granting bail, even in cases under stringent laws like the PMLA. ""Manish Sisodia is in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced; this deprives his right to a speedy trial,"" the top court said. ""Right to speedy trial is a sacrosanct right... Bail cannot be opposed saying that the crime is serious. In matters of liberty, every day counts,"" it added.The CBI and ED had requested the Supreme Court to impose bail conditions similar to those applied to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. However, the court rejected this plea, stating that each case needs to be treated on its own merits rather than applying uniform conditions across the board.The Supreme Court has consistently reiterated this principle in various judgments. In 2011, the court granted bail to five accused in the 2G spectrum case, including Sanjay Chandra, while underscoring that bail is the rule. Similarly, in 2019, the court granted bail to P Chidambaram in the INX Media case, despite the seriousness of economic offenses, affirming that the fundamental jurisprudence of bail remained unchanged.In November 2020, the Supreme Court extended interim bail to journalist Arnab Goswami, highlighting the critical nature of personal liberty and the principle of bail as the norm.CJI DY Chandrachud, in his address at the All India District Judges Conference in March, voiced concerns about the declining adherence to this principle in lower courts. He emphasized the need for judges to prioritize personal liberty and adhere to the established legal standard.","The 'bail is the rule, and jail is the exception' principle was first used in the 1977 landmark judgment of the 'State of Rajasthan vs Balchand alias Baliya' Case underscored that bail should be denied only in circumstances where there is a risk of the accused fleeing from justice, obstructing justice, repeating offenses, or intimidating witnesses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112410190,imgsize-1682715,width-400,resizemode-4/112410190.jpg"

PARIS: When Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final Thursday night, the pressure was on Neeraj Chopra to better it.The Indian believed he could do it, but in his desperation to go past his Pakistani rival’s mark, he ended up with four foul throws. Trying to come to terms with his first loss to Nadeem since 2016, Neeraj, who threw 89.45m and bagged silver, said a nagging groin injury has been bothering him.“When I get ready for my throws, 70-80% of my focus is on my injury as I don’t want to aggravate it. My speed drops and so I start pushing myself. Before the last World Championships , the doctor had advised me to go for surgery . But I didn’t have the time. I couldn’t do it before Olympics either. But (now) I will have to make a big decision,” the current world champion said here after the event, adding that the same throw could have been four metres further had he been in perfect shape.Despite the disappointment of not winning back-to-back Olympic gold, many consider Neeraj the greatest-ever Indian athlete. He, though, remains humble. “It’s been a great journey after starting from a small village,” he said.Starting off, Neeraj never believed he would be on the Olympic podium one day. “I didn’t have the physique or the background. I don’t know how I reached this far,” Neeraj said.Talking about his injury, “It was in 2017 that I felt the groin pain for the first time and after that I had a lot of treatment. At the beginning of this year, everything was perfect. Maybe (I have to undergo) surgery… I will speak to my team and make a decision,” Neeraj said. The champion athlete had tried to play down the injury in the build-up to the Olympics, but now that it’s all down, he was ready to explain how difficult it was. “I was not able to throw using my full runway for the last couple of years.Normally, we make 40-50 throws in each session. But in my case the session itself was happening once every two or three weeks because of the injury scare. Till you throw, you are not working with the javelin and then it is very difficult to lift it. But now I’m throwing because I have the belief in my hand,” Neeraj said. The champion said he won’t rest till he manages the big throws.“I still have many good throws left in me. Until I achieve that, I won’t get peace. I now realise that mindset is very important going into an Olympics. I will surely do it if my body is willing to come along as my mind will be ready. If you can stay away from injury, then your throw gets bigger and bigger,” the 26-year-old said. Neeraj’s first throw on Thursday was a foul, but that didn’t affect his confidence.“After the foul in the first throw, I had confidence ahead of the second throw that I could do it. I was pushing myself a lot but the throw was good and I can tell you that I still have a lot of big throws left in me. For that I have to keep myself fit.” Asked what changed between the qualification when he appeared in great form and the final, the 26-year-old said: “In the qualification round it’s all easy and relaxed. But finals are different. I tried to keep my mind the same but it was hard. I tried to go really fast on the runway but it didn’t work.Even in qualification I was really close to the line but I stopped within one step.” The pulls and pressures of commercial commitments become part and parcel of a top athlete’s life, but Neeraj has learnt to take that in his stride.“After Tokyo, I gave priority to sports. With great difficulty we get a chance to endorse a brand. So if you get a chance then who will leave it? But I don’t want to overdo it, because if my body breaks, nothing will be left.” Neeraj was tired but his sense of humour was intact. “Motivating myself to talk in English is almost like being in competition with the best in the business,” he said as everyone burst into laughter.","Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final.

"Cabinet counters SC, rejects creamy layer in Dalit quota",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-counters-sc-rejects-creamy-layer-in-dalit-quota/articleshow/112412751.cms,"Don’t implement SC/ST creamy layer ruling of top court, 100 MPs urge PM

NEW DELHI: Modi govt has rejected the recent Supreme Court ruling asking for exclusion of ‘ creamy layer ’ among Dalits from the purview of quotas, saying that doing so would be unconstitutional.“Recently, the Supreme Court gave a judgment on the issue of reservation. The SC has made some suggestions about SC/ST reservation in it. Today, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, wide discussions were held on this issue.And the well-thought-through opinion of the cabinet is that NDA govt is committed and dedicated towards the provisions of the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar And as per provisions of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is no provision of creamy layer in SC/ST reservation. Cabinet’s decision is that SC/ST reservation should be according to Babasaheb’s Constitution,” I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in what marked a swift rebuttal of the SC's landmark verdict.Significantly, Modi had signalled his govt's intent hours before the cabinet got down to discuss the issue by telling SC/ST MPs belonging to BJP that the apex court's verdict was only recommendatory and that govt was alive to their “genuine” concerns about it.The top court had held that exclusion of creamy layer, a reference to those whose previous generation had benefited from the SC quota, would help reservation benefits reach the truly disadvantaged instead of being monopolised by better-off sections among Dalits.The Cabinet on Friday asserted that there was no provision for a creamy layer in reservation for SCs and STs in the Constitution given by B R Ambedkar. The decision came in the wake of the recent SC ruling.The Aug 1 SC ruling on creamy layer came from the sole Dalit judge on the bench, Justice B R Gavai, with others — CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma, concurring.However, the idea that the concept of ‘creamy layer’, so far limited to OBCs, needed to be extended to Dalits as well ran afoul of the dominant opinion. Dalit politicians, intellectuals & activists argued that likening OBCs to Dalits was a folly because of differences between the two categories and, also, that advancement in economic status of SCs did not erase the stigma or reduce the discrimination — the principal reason for bringing them under the cover of protective discrimination.“Met a delegation of SC/ST MPs today. Reiterated our commitment and resolve for welfare and empowerment of SC/ST communities,” Modi wrote on X. His remarks also reflected that the govt was looking into concerns expressed by community leaders regarding the apex court ruling.The delegation of more than 100 MPs, including ministers Kiren Rijiju, Sarbananda Sonowal, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Kamlesh Paswan, Birendra Kumar and senior functionaries like Faggan Singh Kulaste called on PM Modi and handed him a memorandum, expressing concern over the SC ruling. They urged that this decision should not be enforced.BJP MP Sikander Kumar said the PM had promised the govt would take MPs’ concerns into account. Kulaste said the PM supported their stance.","PM Narendra Modi had signalled his govt's intent hours before the cabinet got down to discuss the issue.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday stayed till Nov 18 a Mumbai college ’s circular banning students from wearing hijab, cap or badge but allowed the educational institution to continue enforcing its circular banning wearing of burqa , niqab or stole in its premises.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar issued notice to the college on a petition jointly filed by three students — Zainab Abdul Qayyum Choudhary, Nasreen Bano Mohd Tanzim Shaikh and Nazneen Mazhar Ansari — appealing against a Bombay HC order upholding the college circular.It said, “In the meanwhile, we stay clause 2 of the circular to the extent that it directs that no hijab, cap or badge will be permitted.”Clause 2 of the Mumbai college circular reads, “You (students) shall follow the dress code of college of formal and decent dress which shall not reveal anyone’s religion such as ‘no burkha, no niqab, no hijab, no cap, no badge, no stole, etc. Only full or half-shirt and normal trousers for boys and any Indian/western non-revealing dress for girls on the college campus. Changing rooms available for girls.”The Justice Sanjiv Khanna-led bench, however, orally clarified that no burqa can be worn by anyone inside the college or classrooms. The interim stay was confined to the ban on wearing hijab, cap or badge.Appearing for ‘ Chembur Trombay Educational Society ’, under which the college in question functioned, senior advocate Madhavi Divan said there were 441 Muslim women students pursuing various courses in the college and none of them, except the three petitioners, had any objection to the circular.She apprehended that allowing hijab, which is a barrier to female students getting educated and interacting with others, inside an education institution would be exploited by vested groups. “How will we stop anyone from wearing saffron shawls to the college?” she asked.Justice Khanna asked, “Will you stop a student wearing tilak from entering the college?” Going a step further, Justice Kumar asked, “Will you stop a student’s entry if she wears a bindi? Should it not be left to the girl to decide what she wants to wear? Where is your initiative to empower women by providing for no dress code? The less said the better.”The bench, while keeping its interim order in force till Nov 18, took note of Divan’s apprehensions about the interim order being exploited by vested elements and said, “If the interim order is misused, the college will be at liberty to move SC for appropriate orders.”The bench agreed with the circular that students must be dressed decently inside the college. Divan said the circular was religion neutral and intended not to reveal the religion of students. She said when the matter was being adjudicated by the Bombay HC, the college had resisted a Hindu outfit’s plea to intervene in the proceedings.Justice Kumar said, “You do not want the students’ religion to be revealed? Won’t their names reveal their religion? Will you give them numbers at the gate so that they are not addressed by their names but by numbers? What is all this?”Justice Khanna said a statutory appeal against the hijab ban was pending adjudication of a larger bench of the SC. A two-judge bench of the SC had on Oct 13, 2022, given a split verdict on the hijab ban in Karnataka govt educational institutions. That issue was referred to a larger bench and it has not been listed for hearing yet.Divan further added, “These (burqa, hijab and niqab) are barriers for students from getting education. We have created lockers. We told them if you like you can come wearing hijabs and keep these in lockers provided by the college. Change rooms are also provided.”Justice Khanna saw merit in Divan’s argument and said, “You may be somewhat right because the background they belong to, the family may be insisting that they must wear hijab and go to college and insist in not taking off the hijab.”Divan said, “Tomorrow how do we prevent students from coming to college wearing saffron shawls when some are permitted to wear niqabs? We cannot be a playground for religion or politics.”Justice Kumar continued in the same vein and asked, “When was the college established? How come suddenly you realised that there are different religions in the country? It is unfortunate that you come up with these kinds of instructions. After so many years of independence, you realise that there are different religions in this country? The college was established in 2008 and till now you had no difficulty and suddenly you have woken up?” When the bench said it was going to stay the circular, Divan pleaded for a detailed hearing. But the bench said it would hear her in Nov.When Divan complained that the college’s autonomy was being taken away, the bench said, “Your autonomy is not taken away but don’t insist that A or B should be coming dressed in a particular manner. The solution to a lot of things, as you said, is proper and good education. I certainly know that burqas can’t be permitted in a college. You can’t sit in a class wearing a burqa.”","Supreme Court stays Mumbai college’s circular banning students from wearing hijab, cap or badge. Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar issued notice to the college on a petition jointly filed by three students.

The resolution must be passed by 50% of the members present, plus one member, of those present in the House on that day. If the resolution gets passed, it has to go to Lok Sabha to be passed by a simple majority for it to get accepted, explained a senior RS MP. This procedure follows from Articles 67 (b), 92 and 100 of the Constitution.Going by this process, the resolution is certain to be defeated in the House, yet opposition members are contemplating moving on it “to prove the point that the chair has deviated from his role as a neutral umpire and hence disrespected the chair”.","The parties have started collating documentary material of instances in the House where Dhankhar has been “partisan in his actions’ The opposition parties are concerned that the microphone of the leader of opposition was allegedly being turned off repeatedly. “The opposition wants the House to be run by rules and conventions, and personal remarks against members are unacceptable,” a source said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112411933,imgsize-1577950,width-400,resizemode-4/112411933.jpg"

Dhankhar vs Kharge over Vinesh Phogat

War of words between Dhankhar and Kharge

NEW DELHI: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar , who has had several run-ins with the opposition leaders during the ongoing Budget session, was at the centre of another fiery faceoff in Rajya Sabha on Friday. An enraged Dhankhar took Jaya Bachchan head on after the Samajwadi Party MP objected to the ""tone"" of Rajya Sabha Chairman against opposition members.The opposition members were seeking an apology from BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari over his 'parivarvaad' taunt against Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge made on August 1.""I Jaya Amitabh Bachchan want to say, I am an artist. I understand body language and expressions. Forgive me but your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, Sir. You may be sitting in the Chair, and I remember when I went to school ... ,"" the SP MP said triggering a storm.A visibly angry Dhankhar interrupted Jaya's speech and said: ""Enough of it ... You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, but you have to understand the decorum ... .""""Jayaji, you have earned a great reputation. (But) you know the actor is subject to the director... you have not seen what I have seen from here (the Chair). Every day... I don't want to repeat, I don't want a schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way ... and you say 'my tone'?"" ""No... no... enough of this. No. You can't have it. No..."" Dhankhar shouted firmly.When an Opposition party member raised objection to how Dhankhar could call Bachchan a celebrity when she was a senior Member of Parliament, the Chairman retorted: ""(Does) a senior member of Parliament has a licence to run down the reputation of the Chair ... to question the tone and tenor?"" Dhankhar then went on to say that he cannot be a party to the House being converted into an ""epicentre of disturbance"".While the opposition accused Dhankhar of being partisan and walked out of the House led by former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, ruling NDA sought a resolution condemning the “charges” of Jaya Bachchan against Jagdeep Dhankhar.""Today’s incident is highly condemnable. I urge the House to pass a resolution condemning this. The opposition's behaviour has been extremely unparliamentary, undisciplined, and disrespectful. The opposition has become issue-less in terms of discussion, and undignified behaviour has become their habit,"" JP Nadda said.However, the deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari, made light of the NDA move and said the censure motion against the opposition is a badge of honour. “The NDA has brought a censure motion against the opposition. It is a badge of honour for us. We will keep fighting for the poor and common people of this country. This censure motion is an award for the entire opposition. We (opposition) will fight this dictatorship and will struggle against the NDA,” Pramod Tiwari said.Tiwari alleged that Jagdeep Dhankhar has not taken any action against Ganshyam Tiwari even after the opposition had given a complaint in writing and added the opposition's voice is being muzzled inside the House.“There are parliamentarians who have an experience of 50 years. However, they are not able to talk and raise the people’s issues as the mic is switched off consistently by the Chairman. Everyone has seen what is being done to Jaya Bachchan. The Chairman does not allow her to speak. She is a veteran and is in Rajya Sabha for the 4 or 5th time,” Tiwari said.Congress MP Ajay Maken said, ""Opposition parties feel the Chairman's approach is partisan. Rajya Sabha is a House that sets parameters for other legislatures. In that House, the Chairman should not be seen as partisan. The Congress alone does not feel that way, all opposition parties feel his behaviour is partial towards one side.""Jaya Bachchan, meanwhile, questioned why Kharge was not allowed to speak by the Chairman.""We are not school children, some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone and especially when leader of opposition stood up to speak, he had switched off the mic. How can you do this? This is against the tradition. You have to allow the leader,"" Jaya told reporters.She also alleged that members sitting in the Treasury benches use unparliamentary words. ""'You are a nuisance', 'Buddhiheen' (stupid), all these words are also spoken by Treasury benches,"" she alleged.The opposition is considering submitting a notice for moving a resolution to remove the Vice-President from his office, news agency PTI said quoting sources. The timing of the notice is to be discussed and decided and though the resolution may not go through it would be a statement to highlight the Chair's ""blatantly and consistently partisan"" approach.According to Article 67(b) of the Constitution, ""Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days' notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.""Opposition sources said 87 members have signed on the proposal to initiate action against Dhankhar.A source said around two days ago, leader of house JP Nadda was informally informed that the opposition is considering submitting a motion to remove Dhankhar.On Wednesday, Dhankhar had accused opposition of ""challenging"" the authority of the Chair. This was after Kharge was denied permission to speak on the issue of wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who was disqualified from the Paris Olympics after being found overweight ahead of her 50kg final match.During the discussion on Appropriation (No 2) Bill 2024 and Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation (No 3) Bill, 2024, the opposition members kept sloganeering demanding justice for Phogat but Dhankhar said nothing would go on record.Kharge said he wanted to speak with the Chair's permission on an issue to which Dhankhar responded that he had declined the permission and the debate would continue.Dhankhar said that LoP wanted the Chair to interrupt the debate without taking recourse to any rule and shared his message seeking permission to take the floor without spelling out the issue.After the members walked out, Dhankhar said their act was ""indecorous, undignified, challenging the authority of Chair"".""An LoP, an important fulcrum in Parliamentary democracy ... so painful. I have no words to take exception to such kind of conduct,"" Dhankhar said.In July, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, a war of words erupted between Dhankhar and Kharge after the former sarcastically told Congress member Jairam Ramesh to take the latter’s post of LoP. Kharge, who is a Dalit, said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull”. An agitated Dhankhar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.(With inputs from agencies)","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar at centre of another fiery faceoff in Rajya Sabha.

'Will you ban girls wearing bindi or tilak?' SC on hijab ban imposed by Mumbai college,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-you-ban-girls-wearing-bindi-or-tilak-sc-stays-hijab-ban-imposed-by-mumbai-college/articleshow/112399456.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday partly stayed the enforcement of a hijab ban at a Mumbai college until November 18.""Will you ban girls wearing bindi or tilak,"" the bench asked, while staying the circular banning wearing of hijab, no cap, or badge on campus. ""Girl students must have freedom of choice in what they are wearing and college cannot force them...It's unfortunate that you suddenly wake up to know that there are many religions in the country,"" the bench told the college administration.The college contended that allowing Muslim female students to wear hijabs could lead to Hindu students wearing saffron shawls, as political elements might exploit the situation.The top court said its interim order on 'burqa, hijab' should not be misused and granted liberty to Mumbai college to approach the court in case of misuse.Furthermore, the apex court ruled that girls cannot wear burqas inside classrooms and that religious activities are not allowed on campus.The Supreme Court was hearing a plea challenging a Bombay high court verdict upholding a Mumbai college's decision to ban hijabs, burqas and naqabs inside the campus.The petitioners sought an urgent hearing due to upcoming unit tests. On June 26, the high court refused to interfere with the college's decision, stating that such rules do not infringe upon students' fundamental rights and that a dress code is intended to maintain discipline, which is part of the college's fundamental right to establish and administer an educational institution.On October 13, 2022, a two-judge bench of the apex court delivered opposing verdicts in the hijab controversy emanating from Karnataka. The then BJP-led state government had imposed a ban on wearing the Islamic head covering in schools there.The Bombay high court dismissed the plea against the ban, stating that the dress code applied to all students regardless of religion or caste.The students, who were in their second and third years of a science degree program, had approached the high court, arguing that the college's directive imposing a dress code violated their fundamental right to practice religion, right to privacy, and right to choice. They claimed that the college's action was ""arbitrary, unreasonable, bad-in-law and perverse.""","The top court said its interim order on 'burqa, hijab' should not be misused.

Out of them, eight have passed away, 14 were discharged or in some manner have come back with govt’s assistance and “there are 69 citizens awaiting release from Russian army,” he said, in response to a question in LS.Out of the eight who died, the mortal remains of four have been sent back to India and in two cases — one from Haryana and Punjab — DNA samples have been sent to the Russian side.In one case from Gujarat, the family wants the body to be cremated in Russia and in another case from UP, the mortal remains are being brought back, Jaishankar said while responding to a Parliament question in the Lok Sabha.According to the EAM, the issue is that Russian authorities maintain these Indian entered contracts for services with Russian army. “We are not necessarily subscribing to that... In many cases there are reasons to indicate that our nationals were misled, that they were told that they were going for some other job and then they were deployed with the Russian army,” he added.The issue of Indians recruited into Russian army was taken up by PM Modi during his meeting with Russian president Putin last month. “We take this issue very very seriously.

Bangladesh foreign policy adviser holds mixed views on India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-foreign-policy-adviser-holds-mixed-views-on-india/articleshow/112412341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh foreign policy adviser Touhid Hossain said after assuming office Dhaka will maintain a balance in ties with big powers and seek good ties with all. Hossain, who served as foreign secretary from late 2006 to July, 2009, also said the immediate priority for the interim govt that was sworn in on Thursday is to restore law and order and the country.Hossain is known to have mixed views on India, acknowledging India’s importance for Dhaka on the one hand, but also accusing it of not doing enough to uphold Bangladesh’s interests on the other.Hossain said last year in a lecture that Bangladesh’s interests were not protected as much as India’s in the past 15 years, a period that saw excellent ties between the govts but not necessarily the people. This was the reason, according to him, the relationship could not be considered a “role model’’. India has maintained for years that the relationship with Bangladesh is a model for bilateral relations not just in the region but also beyond.Bangladesh’s Prothom Alo newspaper quoted him as saying last year that, according to history, the best combination for relations between the two countries is Awami League in govt in Dhaka and Congress in Delhi. Significantly, Hossain is seen as pro-West and has long maintained that Dhaka needs to mend its ties with the western countries. Just before the elections this year in Bangladesh, he wrote that while ties with India will always remain important, and Dhaka needs to maintain good ties with Russia and China too, “none of these countries can substitute our relations with western countries’’.In another column earlier this year, Hossain said that by any consideration, the relationship with India is most important for Bangladesh’s foreign policy but added that while Bangladesh had delivered almost everything India asked for, India had displayed indifference and reluctance in meeting Bangladesh’s “few demands’’. To back his argument, he has often cited India’s failure to deliver on the Teesta river water sharing.“People are still being shot along the border by BSF guards . The excuses made by the Indian govt to exonerate themselves of these killings, simply infuriates the people of Bangladesh further. India is also depriving Bangladesh of its share of the river Teesta’s water on the excuse of their domestic politics,’’ he said in a column in January, adding there were other irritants like non-tariff barriers and India not allowing Bangladesh access to Nepal through the Siliguri Corridor.","Hossain is known to have mixed views on India, acknowledging India’s importance for Dhaka on the one hand, but also accusing it of not doing enough to uphold Bangladesh's interests on the other.

"Dhankhar’s spat with Jaya sets off clash in Rajya Sabha, opposition walks out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhankhars-spat-with-jaya-sets-off-clash-in-rajya-sabha-opposition-walks-out/articleshow/112412281.cms,"NDA backs Dhankhar amid

opposition walkout

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha witnessed an uproar on Friday with NDA and the opposition facing off over Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar . The trigger was BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari ’s remarks on leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge , leading to an acrimonious exchange between Dhankhar and SP MP Jaya Bachchan .She protested against what she called was the “unacceptable tone” of the Chairman’s remarks and said he was a “colleague” sitting on the chair, after which an infuriated Dhankhar accused the opposition of working to disrupt the House and destabilise the country.Soon, matters had escalated to a wider confrontation between the treasury and opposition benches with the former seeing the disruptions as part of a destabilisation plan and the latter accusing the Chairman of being partisan. Dhankhar argued that Tiwari had only praised Kharge in his remarks but the opposition claimed he was trying to shield the BJP MP.As she stood to make a point in the middle of a heated exchange, Jaya Bachchan said she was an artist and understood body language and expressions. “Forgive me but your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, sir. You may be sitting in the chair, and I remember when I went to school...” she said. A visibly angry Jagdeep Dhankhar interrupted her and said he “did not want to be schooled”, repeatedly saying “enough of it”, as he also hit out at opposition.“Jaya ji, you’ve earned a great reputation. You know, an actor is subject to the director. You’ve not seen what I see from here... I don’t want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone...” Dhankhar said, adding, “You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, you have to understand decorum. Never carry an impression that only you build reputations. We live up to reputations, nothing doing.”When an opposition member objected to Dhankhar calling Bachchan a celebrity when she was a senior MP, the chairman retorted, “Does a senior MP have licence to run down the reputation of the chair... to question the tone and tenor?”Bachchan had, for the last few days, felt annoyed over being called Jaya Amitabh Bachchan. However, Dhankhar, as well as his deputy Harivansh, have pointed out that they are bound by the rule that a member will be identified by the name as it was in official records.As opposition walked out of the House, NDA MPs expressed solidarity with Dhankhar and demanded an apology from Bachchan. Leader of the House J P Nadda condemned the behaviour of opposition MPs and moved a censure motion against Bachchan.Earlier, Dhankhar said, “I know you (opposition) want to destabilise the entire nation. You are out to create chaos in the House. I shall not be party to this House being epicentre of disturbance. You are determined to have your way at the cost of the Constitution. It is a lack of decorum... disrespect to democracy. You are walking away from your obligations.”","Rajya Sabha witnessed an uproar on Friday with NDA and the opposition facing off over Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.
