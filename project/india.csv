The locals of Nirmal Jote, where the incident occurred, insisted the rescue team arrived late and pointed out that many of the injured were taken to hospitals in e-rickshaws, as ambulances had arrived much later.Md Hasim, one of the locals who had rushed to the spot along with his friends, said they used chisels and hammers to pry open doors and evacuate passengers stuck inside. Also, because it had been raining, most coach windows were shut.

NEET-UG row fallout: Government mulls NTA reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-row-fallout-government-mulls-nta-reforms/articleshow/111067540.cms,"NEW DELHI: Post-resolution of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) controversies, significant reforms are anticipated within the National Testing Agency (NTA). According to govt sources, extensive changes in the agency's operations and exam administration are under consideration, with a high-level committee likely to be established for recommendations..The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on June 4, faced widespread criticism from students and parents. Legal challenges were filed against the results, highlighting three main issues: the provision of grace marks to some students, claims of a leaked question paper, and suspected irregularities at specific exam centres. Many have called for an investigation and a retake of the exam.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan emphasised on Sunday that the ""harshest punishment"" would be administered to those found guilty in the NEET UG 2024 ""scam"", while assuring students and parents that govt is taking the matter seriously.A senior govt official said: ""The matter is currently in the courts. The education ministry and NTA are also examining the details. However, once the issue is resolved based on the investigations and court orders, significant reforms will be initiated in all aspects of conducting these crucial examinations."" The official added that the ministry of education is likely to form a committee to recommend the reforms.As of Nov 2023, the NTA registered over 1.23 crore candidates, making it one of the largest exam-conducting bodies globally, second only to China's Gaokao, which registered 1.29 crore candidates in 2023.For NEET-UG 2024, over 24 lakh candidates registered, while 14.7 lakh registered for the Joint Entrance Examination (Main), and more than 13.4 lakh for the CUET-UG 2024.

"China boosting nuclear arsenal, has 3x India's warheads: SIPRI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-boosting-nuclear-arsenal-has-3x-indias-warheads-sipri/articleshow/111067300.cms,"NEW DELHI: China is boosting its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country around the globe, and now has triple the number of warheads that India has, while it also deploys some of them on ""high operational alert"" on ballistic missiles.Pakistan, in turn, maintains its rough parity with India in the number of nuclear warheads, while Russia and the US are leagues ahead of others, together accounting for 90% of all nuclear weapons .China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172 (from 164 in 2023) and Pakistan 170 (unchanged from 2023), as per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) released on Monday.The Indian defence establishment, however, remains confident of its strategic deterrence capability, which is poised to get some additional teeth after the already-inducted over 5,000-km range Agni-5 ballistic missile was tested for the first time with multiple-warhead capability on March 11 this year.Moreover, India is increasingly going in for more canister-launch missiles - with the warhead already mated with the missile - for the requisite operational readiness and flexibility to store it for long periods, swiftly transport it through rail or road, and fire it whenever required.India is also set to strengthen its weakest leg of the nuclear triad by finally commissioning its second SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles), INS Arighat, within the next few months. The first, INS Arihant, became operational in 2018.SIPRI said the deterrence role of nuclear weapons has grown amid the ongoing geopolitical turmoil over conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas ones. All the nine nuclear-armed states continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals, with several deploying new nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable weapon systems in 2023, it said.The nuclear stockpiles stand at: Russia (4,380 warheads), US (3,708), France (290), UK (225), Israel (90) and North Korea (50). An estimated 3,904 of these warheads are deployed with missiles and aircraft, with the rest being kept in storage.""Around 2,100 of the deployed warheads were kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles. Nearly all of these warheads belonged to Russia or the US, but for the first time China is believed to have some warheads on high operational alert,"" SIPRI said.The Pentagon, in a report last Oct, had said China was fully on course to reach over 1,000 warheads by 2030, while it also builds a formidable arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Swedish think-tank, on its part, said China could potentially have at least as many ICBMs as Russia or the US by the turn of the decade, although its stockpile of nuclear warheads is still expected to remain much smaller than their stockpiles.SIPRI also said India, Pakistan and North Korea are all pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, a capability that the US, UK, Russia, France and China already have. ""This would enable a rapid potential increase in deployed warheads, as well as the possibility for nuclear-armed countries to threaten the destruction of significantly more targets,"" it said.","China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172. Pakistan, in turn, maintains its rough parity with India in the number of nuclear warheads. Russia and the US are leagues ahead of others, together accounting for 90% of all nuclear weapons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111067310,imgsize-23134,width-400,resizemode-4/111067310.jpg"
9 die as goods train rear-ends Kanchanjungha Express in Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9-die-as-goods-train-rear-ends-kanchanjungha-express-in-bengal/articleshow/111067266.cms,"SILIGURI/ KOLKATA: A goods train allegedly disregarded a signal and rear-ended the Sealdah-bound Kanchanjungha Express near north Bengal's New Jalpaiguri station at 8.55am Monday, causing four bogies and five freight containers to derail. At least nine people died and 41 were injured in the accident that was eerily similar to the three-train pile-up near Odisha's Balasore last June that killed 296.Five of the nine who died were in a general compartment ahead of two parcel vans of the express train that seemingly absorbed most of the impact of the crash between Rangapani and Chattar Hat stations, around 11km from New Jalpaiguri. Four passenger trains had passed that stretch minutes before the accident.Among the casualties were loco pilot Anil Kumar of the goods train, Kanchanjungha Express guard Ashish Dey, state excise inspector Kaleb Subba, railway employee Shankar Mohan Das, and passengers Subhajit Mali and Beauty Begum. Three of the dead hadn't been identified till late evening.The four derailed bogies of the express and five cargo containers fell on the adjoining track, stalling rail traffic along a stretch of the lone route that connects Guwahati and the Northeast with the rest of the country. Kavach, the railways' automatic anti-collision system, has not been installed on this busy route yet.Railway Board chairperson and CEO Jaya Varma Sinha said a ""human error"" by the deceased loco pilot of the goods train may have triggered the collision, while railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the accident site that a thorough inquiry by the Commission of Railway Safety would reveal the cause. ""The railway accident is saddening. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest. Spoke to officials and took stock of the situation,"" PM Modi posted on X.The PMO first announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of each of the deceased. Vaishnaw later said families of each of the deceased would receive Rs 10 lakh and those who suffered serious injuries would get Rs 2.5 lakh each. For minor injuries, the amount is Rs 50,000.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee accused the railways of not caring for passenger safety. ""They are only keen on hiking fares,"" she said.A passenger in one of the compartments in the middle said he felt a huge jolt, followed by pandemonium. ""Passengers were running helter-skelter. There were screams all around. We got off the train and ran towards the rear. What we saw was shocking. One bogie had turned over, another appeared to be hanging in the air. A third was mangled.""The first responders were local residents. Police, railway and administrative officials reached the spot later along with NDRF personnel.

BJP has also planned to hold a protest against the petrol price increase on Monday.The Karnataka government announced a hike in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3 per litre and Rs 3.02 per litre respectively, effective immediately, garnering strong reactions and concerns from opposition leaders and residents.BJP Spokesperson S Prakash called out the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government for substantially raising petrol prices in the state immediately after the parliamentary elections concluded. ""People were expecting Rs 8,000 into their accounts by Rahul Gandhi, on the contrary, they have been hugely burdened by petroleum products,"" he said.BJP leader BY Vijayendra said, ""Faced by defeat in Lok Sabha polls, the chief minister is not ready to accept that the financial situation of the state has deteriorated, but the hike in fuel prices proves it. The government is unable to run the administration because of guarantees, they are unable to get proper resources. The government should withdraw this decision (of fuel price hike). ""On Monday, we are going to organise protests across Karnataka,"" he added.The price surge has been linked to the state government's decision to adjust the sales tax on petroleum products, according to the Petroleum Dealers Association. The Karnataka finance department's choice to increase sales tax is intended to boost the state's revenue.

Unravelling mystery

Justice for man’s kin priority, not ban: Sudeep

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.Amid the demand to ban Sandalwood star Darshan over his arrest in the Renukaswamy murder case, his colleague Kichcha Sudeep said, “Ban is secondary. The focus should be on providing justice to the person in pain.”Speaking to reporters Sunday, Sudeep lauded the police and media for bringing out the facts. “The film chamber is there to provide justice to those in the in dustry. The right word is not ban, but justice. The focus should first be on providing justice to the aggrieved family,” he said.Refusing to take a stand for or against Darshan, he said,“ As an artist, it is wrong to speak for or against someone. What is needed is justice for the family — the woman, the unborn child, Renukaswamy. People should have their faith restored in justice.”“Everyone’s heart goes out to the family. The whole atmosphere doesn’t seem right; the cinema industry needs justice. Everything wrong gets attributed to the industry. It needs a clean chit. After justice is delivered in court and the guilty are pinned, the industry will get a clean chit,” he said, adding: “Celebrities are not gods. Don’t treat them like that. Don’t put that sort of pressure.”",Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played key role in Darshan's arrest. Girish questioned four men who claimed to be involved in the murder of Renukaswamy. The four men said they were just fall guys and were offered money to go to jail. Darsha's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda was also arrested.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"
Note to CM M K Stalin: Prepping for 2026? Here’s what’s left on your to-do list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/note-to-cm-prepping-for-2026-heres-whats-left-on-your-to-do-list/articleshow/111042998.cms,"With a full score of 40 Lok Sabha seats for the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the just-concluded polls, the focus has shifted to meeting public expectations before the 2026 Assembly polls , which will be even more strongly rooted in state and constituency-level issues.Chief minister M K Stalin , who has set himself a 200-plus seat goal, has resumed implementation of social welfare benefits after the poll code ended, most recently the Tamil Pudhalvan monthly higher education stipend scheme for male students in govt schools. This follows up on the Pudumai Penn scheme for girl students and `1,000 a month allowance under the Magalir Urimai Thittam besides the universal free bus passes for womenThere are other promises on the table that the DMK made in its 2021 manifesto that are yet to gain traction and need a sustained administrative push to fill governance deficits that are affecting service delivery.These issues are not new, and the manifesto for the previous Assembly poll took note of the gaps while making key promises: enacting a Right to Services Act , reviving the State Lok Ayukta and its operations, revamping the DVAC against corruption , re-establishing uzhavar sandhais across Tamil Nadu, changing over to monthly electricity billing, and opening 500 Kalaignar canteens.The toughest among the pending reforms is the right to services law, since it requires administrative processes to be streamlined and computerised over a period of time, and successfully guarantee a time-bound service — while incorporating penalties for officers who cause delays without a valid reason.Over a decade, the BJP-led Union govt failed to come up with a right to service law on the lines of the Right to Information Act of the UPA, which states could have adopted. The DMK made an election promise in 2021, but there has been no momentum to achieve this. Incremental reforms have been made, such as self-certification for newly built small houses to address bottlenecks and rent-seeking in property registration, but bigger problems remain. Approvals for building plans and water and electricity connections remain problematic, with no pressure on officials to provide a time-bound service or face a penalty.In the case of the registration department, where smooth access to services even now usually depends on document writers acting as intermediaries, the DMK-era high-level committee on administrative reforms and prevention of corruption, led by Justice G Ramanujam in 1997, said in its report, “a whole institution of document writers, copy writers and stamp vendors has grown with the department over several years, and many among these professionals are perceived as agents or touts for arranging the regular flow of mamool bribe money from registrants to departmental officers.”While stamp paper as a resource has been replaced with online fee payment, discretion in the calculation of property value is removed, and online scheduling of registration appointments introduced, a key aspect observed by the committee, of property documents narrated in dense and complicated language, continues to push registrants to document writer-agents.A right to services law should support registrants with access to online and designated physical centres, at a nominal fee. Compulsory service timelines would be set and penalties levied on officers for default, making the system more accountable. This writer recently encountered document writers stipulating an unrecorded payment of `25,000 for settlement deed registration, in addition to the legal fee payable to the govt.The rise of large real estate projects has led to built-in payments for service agencies, with realtors marking up fees for civic services such as electricity and water connections in gated communities and residential buildings. Despite house buyers being aware, there is no scrutiny of these inflated service fees.The Ramanujam Committee noted that the govt had said it would produce a Tamil booklet on the procedures to be followed in real estate to clear the air for citizens. The govt could highlight in such a book and more widely, the procedure to file complaints of corruption with the state lok ayukta in plain language, doing away with the requirement for technical, notarised complaints.In May, there were a mere four complaints filed with Tamil Nadu lok ayukta, and 29 were pending. No complaints were disposed of during the month. Moreover, even the case details at this body are not published, with no names or details of lok ayukta orders passed. Interestingly, it was during the 2020-22 COVID-19 phase that maximum complaints were filed before the lok ayukta. Taking the DMK manifesto promise forward, the functioning of this body needs review and more light has to be thrown on its cases and orders.Two decades ago, the World Bank recommended Tamil Nadu conduct periodic independent surveys on public perception of corruption in administration and service delivery, with the results published. Such a step would raise transparency.The review recommended strengthening the DVAC by moving from “raid and trap” methods to active monitoring of administrative processes to detect corruption. The committee noted that the department is ill-equipped for complex cases involving procurement, execution of works, and service delivery corruption. Little has changed since.Despite several online initiatives, only a law enforcing time-bound service delivery with penalties for officials can hold the administrative machinery accountable. A template for this is available in the UPA-era right of citizens for time-bound delivery of goods and services and redressal of their grievances bill and electronic delivery of services bill, both from 2011. The former provided for a penalty of up to `50,000 to be levied on govt officials failing to deliver the service and the latter, penalty of between `5,000 and `20,000. The bills inevitably lapsed.Expanding the map of uzhavar sandhais, including in big cities, making all services disabled-friendly and opening many times more than the promised 500 Kalaignar canteens would strengthen the next political manifesto.Computerisation and electronic applications eliminate friction and bottlenecks in govt services. As a state with strong welfare policies, it is crucial to eliminate administrative corruption with a strong service delivery law. Strengthening the RTI Act by appointing information commissioners and mandating full disclosure by govt departments will make administrative reform meaningful.(The writer is a Chennai-based journalist)(Email your feedback to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com)",The DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry won 40 Lok Sabha seats in the just-concluded polls.

Delhi water crisis: Atishi alleges BJP sabotage; wants police protection for pipelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-water-crisis-atishi-alleges-bjp-sabotage-wants-police-protection-for-pipelines/articleshow/111047822.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi water minister Atishi wrote to police commissioner Sanjay Arora on Sunday, requesting deployment of personnel for protection of major pipelines for the next 15 days as a Delhi Jal Board patrol team had found signs of sabotage at several spots of the water network.Later in the day at a press conference, the minister alleged the possibility of BJP's hand in the damage to the pipelines.Atishi's letter to the police commissioner said that production of treated water had reduced by about ""70 MGD"".She wrote that Delhi Jal Board had deployed patrol teams to check the main distribution network that carries raw water to the treatment plants, and from there to the main underground reservoirs in different parts of the city. ""In addition, we have deployed teams under the supervision of ADMs to support this work,"" she wrote.The minister said that on Saturday, DJB's patrol team found a major leakage in the main pipeline that carries water from the Sonia Vihar treatment plant to south Delhi. ""This (the leak) was near the DTL substation in Garhi Medhu. Our patrolling team found that several large 375 mm bolts and one 12-inch bolt had been cut from the pipeline, causing leakage. The fact that several large bolts had been cut seems to indicate foul play and sabotage,"" the letter said.Atishi requested Arora to deploy police personnel to prevent ""miscreants or people with ulterior motives"" from ""tampering with the water pipelines "".About the damaged pipeline, she mentioned that a team worked for six hours and repaired the leak. ""But this meant that we had to stop pumping water for 6 hours, and 20 MGD was not pumped during this time. As a consequence, a further 25% of water shortage will be experienced in south Delhi,"" she added.Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj mentioned that several areas in south Delhi such as Greater Kailash, Kalkaji and Chirag Delhi, had got less water because the Sonia Vihar pipeline had been tampered with. ""There are plates to join the pipelines and bolts to clamp the plate. Some miscreants had cut them, leading to the leakage. For repairs, the line had to be shut down,"" he said in a video message.Bharadwaj denied claims that the leaks were not being addressed. He said miscreants were deliberately damaging the pipelines and then making videos to defame Delhi govt.At her news conference, Atishi wondered aloud how BJP functionaries had reached the broken pipelines. ""They click photos. Yesterday, the pipeline that supplies water to south Delhi from Sonia Vihar was found broken. Was this pipeline broken intentionally This would not have happened on its own. This is also a part of the conspiracy,"" she said.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said that it was regrettable that instead of working to fix leaks in pipelines and check water theft, Atishi was trying put blame BJP. ""Tomorrow BJP workers will hold protests across the city in 52 places against Kejriwal govt's failure to check leaks and water theft,"" he said.Later on Sunday, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey, along with his supporters, reached the residence of Union water minister CR Patil, demanding his intervention. ""We have written to Union water minister CR Patil, asking him to intervene and solve the problem. Today, we came to meet him regarding the matter. Although we did not meet him, we have given him the letter through his office,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP MLAs were refusing to follow Atishi's order that MLAs should go to Patil's home. ""Hardly 8 MLAs turned up outside his house, forcing AAP to abandon its agitation,"" he said.","Delhi Jal Board patrol team found signs of sabotage at several spots of the water network.

Assembly elections: BJP hits the ground running to counter INDIA bloc's Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assembly-elections-bjp-hits-the-ground-running-to-counter-india-blocs-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/111063441.cms,"First electoral test after LS polls

But why are these elections so important for the saffron party?

Can INDIA bloc continue with its dream run?

NEW DELHI: The BJP, which failed to get majority on its own in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections, has taken a head-start for the assembly elections in three key states due later this year. Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will vote to elect a new government between October and December this year. BJP chief JP Nadda on Monday appointed party leaders Bhupinder Yadav and Ashwini Vaishnaw as state election incharge and co-incharge for Maharashtra, while Dharmendra Pradhan and Biplab Kumar Dev have been made election incharges for Haryana. In Jharkhand, the BJP has picked senior leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma as the party's election incharges.The assembly elections will be first litmus test for both the BJP and the INDIA bloc . The saffron party is still smarting from its below-expectation performance in Lok Sabha elections. The BJP did win 240 Lok Sabha seats to emerge as the single largest party, which was more than the combined total of all the opposition parties. But the tally was way behind its much-hyped claim of 370 seats for the party and ""400-paar"" for the ruling coalition NDA. Also, the reduced number of 240 meant that the party is now dependent on its allies for the survival of the government. Contrast this to the overwhelming mandate BJP received in 2014 and 2019 - when it won a majority on its own with 282 and 303 seats respectively. This perhaps explains why the BJP's 2024 performance was not good enough.Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand have been BJP bastions for long. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 23 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra, 10 out of 10 seats in Haryana and 11 out of 14 seats in Jharkhand. In 2014 also, the party had performed very well in these states: 23 in Maharashtra, 7 in Haryana and 12 in Jharkhand. Little wonder, these states were among the ones that were supposed to power the BJP's ambitious target of ""400-paar."" However, the voters in these states had a surprise in store for the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The saffron party won only 9 seats in Maharashtra, 5 in Haryana and 8 in Jharkhand.What makes this Lok Sabha result more worrying for the BJP is the fact that traditionally people of these states have voted in huge numbers for the saffron party in national elections even if they have chosen some other party in the state elections.An example of this was in 2018 when the Congress defeated the BJP in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and formed its government ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, when it came to the national elections, the people of the three states voted overwhelmingly for the BJP once again giving the party 24 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh, 9 out of 11 seats in Chhattisgarh and 24 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan.With assembly elections just months away, the BJP has to act fast and get its house in order in the three key states. While it has to defend its government in Maharashtra and Haryana, in Jharkhand it will have to wrest it back from the INDIA bloc.In Maharashtra particularly, with a RSS-linked magazine questioning the wisdom of BJP's alliance with Ajit Pawar, the saffron party will have to take some quick decisions. The BJP contested Lok Sabha elections in alliance with Eknath Shinde led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP. Both these leaders had split their parties to joined hands with the BJP. There are reports that the BJP has commissioned a survey to assess if it should fight the assembly elections in the state alone or in alliance with these two parties.Haryana has already seen a leadership change and the BJP would hope that it marks the beginning of party's course correction in the state. In Jharkhand, the BJP would try to capitalise on the arrest of former chief minister Hemant Soren and senior Congress leader Alamgir Alam to put the ruling coalition under pressure.The opposition's INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc surprised everyone, including pollsters, with their better-than-expectation performance in 2024 Lok Sabha elections. But will they be able to carry the momentum forward?Well, in Maharashtra at least they have shown the urgency and the need to act fast to consolidate their gains. The first meeting of the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance partners - Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP - has already been held. The top leaders have made the right noises for the electoral battle ahead. However, to keep the momentum going, they will first have to smoothly negotiate the first hurdle of seat-sharing. After the meeting, senior leader Sharad Pawar had a backhanded compliment for PM Modi as he claimed that the opposition alliance won in most of the seats where the Prime Minister campaigned.In Jharkhand and Haryana, the opposition alliance will have to make quick moves to counter a determined BJP. While opposition parties in these three states have had a better rate of success against the BJP in state elections, they would do well not to become complacent and fritter away the Lok Sabha advantage.","Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will vote to elect a new government between October and December this year.

I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad . All I'll say is that I won't let them feel his (Rahul's) absence. I will work hard and try my best to make everybody happy and be a good representative,"" Priyanka said after her candidature was announced on Monday.""I have a good relation with Rae Bareli as I have worked there for 20 years and that relation will never break,"" she said and added that both of them will work together in both the constituencies.Priyanka played an important role in Uttar Pradesh in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections. The Congress leader not just campaigned extensively to help the party win in prestige seats of Raebareli and Amethi, but she was instrumental in stitching the alliance with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party- that eventually proved to be a winning combination for both parties.When negotiations between the two parties had a hit a roadblock over seat sharing, it was Priyanka who dialled Akhilesh and put the alliance back on track.Priyanka's role in Congress's performance in Uttar Pradesh is all the more significant as she had a difficult debut in the state in January 2019 when she was made the general secretary in-charge for crucial eastern Uttar Pradesh and then as the general secretary in-charge of the entire state.The party then registered its worst-ever performance in the state. But the Congress leader continued her efforts to strengthen the organisation at the grassroots level and finally the party seems to be on the path of revival in the politically crucial state.She also led the party's campaign in Himachal Pradesh assembly elections and helped the Congress come to power in the hill state.Congress leaders have often projected her as the new crisis manager of the party. When Sachin Pilot had rebelled against the then chief minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, it was Priyanka had played a key role in ensuring that Pilot stayed with the Congress.In the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka was one of the star campaigners. She targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in her speeches and countered his charges against the grand old party. Priyanka's supporters would have hoped to see her contest from her karmabhoomi of Uttar Pradesh. But for now it is Wayanad calling.If Priyanka wins the Lok Sabha bypolls, it would be for the first time that three members of the Gandhi family will be in Parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi is a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has agreed to take the plunge into electoral politics.

""Annie Raja kept saying that Rahul Gandhi would move out of the state after the elections, which he did,"" he said, adding, ""Another thing has become very clear: the political legacy of the family will be with the son and not the daughter.""Earlier today, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge announced that Rahul Gandhi would continue to represent Rae Bareli in the 18th Lok Sabha, while Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Wayanad. Kharge said that, ""Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats. As per rules, he will have to vacate one seat and continue on one seat. Since June 18 is the last date, we have decided that Rahul should keep his Rae Bareli seat, since it has been very close to the family for a long time. He has received love from the people of Wayanad, and people there want him to retain the seat, but the rules do not allow it.

The initiative is expected to propel the relationship to the next level by removing regulatory barriers and developing a new defence industrial roadmap for joint development and production.Sullivan also held talks with foreign minister S Jaishankar and called on PM Narendra Modi who said in a post on X India remains committed to strengthening the India-US partnership for global good. Sullivan briefed him about the progress in iCET cooperation in areas like AI, semiconductors, defence and space. In the meeting, Modi expressed satisfaction at the speed and scale of the growing partnership and the convergence on regional and global issues.The NSAs exchanged views also on issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Gaza. According to a joint factsheet issued after the NSA meeting, Doval and Sullivan in what was their second iCET talks underscored the vital importance of adapting their ``technology protection toolkits’’ and resolved to prevent the leakage of sensitive and dual-use technologies to countries of concern. While neither side identified the countries of concerns, the US has been working to block the flow of technology to Russia, a country India continues to maintain strong defence ties with despite the promise of unprecedented transfer of technology from the US like in the GE-HAL deal for co-production of jet engines.According to the factsheet titled India and the US will Continue to Chart an Ambitious Course for iCET, Doval and Sullivan stressed the need for continued efforts, particularly under the Strategic Trade Dialogue, to address outstanding barriers to technology collaboration. They acknowledged progress in the GE-HAL jet deal negotiations, India’s planned acquisition of the MQ-9B armed drones and possible co-production of land warfare systems.In defence, they also focused on deepening cooperation to accelerate the joint adoption of cutting-edge commercial technologies for military solutions and capability enhancement of both defense ecosystems, including through an MoU, and expanding defence industrial partnerships, like through the launch of a jointly developed AI Multi-Domain Situational Awareness product.``Our work also continues to be anchored in a shared commitment to ensuring that technology is designed, developed and deployed in a manner consistent with our democratic values and respect for universal human rights, as well as a recognition that the future security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific will hinge on the strength of the India-US,’’ said the joint factsheet.Doval and Sullivan, who twice postponed his visit earlier this year, also underscored their commitment to striving for breakthrough achievements in priority critical and emerging technology areas, by focusing on co-production, co-development and R&D opportunities. They focused on enhancing coordination with like-minded nations to deliver secure, reliable, and cost-competitive technology solutions for the ``Indian and American people and our partners around the world’’.","US NSA Jake Sullivan and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval committed ""concrete action"" in coming months against long-standing barriers to strategic trade, technology and industrial cooperation. The NSAs exchanged views also on issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Gaza.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111066833,imgsize-836635,width-400,resizemode-4/111066833.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday chaired a high-level meeting in Delhi to review the security situation in Manipur . The meeting was held as fresh violence was reported in the north-eastern state.As per a statement by the ministry of home affairs, Shah conducted a holistic review of the security situation in Manipur and directed agencies to ensure that no further incident of violence takes place in the state.The minister directed that more Central forces should be deployed, if required, and Central forces should be deployed strategically to restore peace and tranquility in the state.""He further directed that strict action must be taken as per law against the perpetrators of violence,"" the MHA said.The home minister also reviewed the situation in relief camps, especially in respect of proper availability of food, water, medicines and other basic amenities. He also directed the chief secretary of Manipur to ensure proper health and education facilities for the displaced people and their rehabilitation.Shah also underscored the importance of coordinated approach to resolve the ongoing ethnic conflict.As per the MHA release, Shah said his ministry will talk to both the groups, Meiteis and Kukis, so as to bridge the ethnic divide, at the earliest. He said that the Central government has been actively supporting the Manipur government in strengthening the security situation in the state.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Intelligence Bureau chief Tapan Deka, Army Chief General Manoj Pande, Army Chief (Designate) Lt General Upendra Dwivedi, GoC Three Core HS Sahi, security advisor to Manipur Kuldiep Singh, Manipur chief aecretary Vineet Joshi, Manipur DGP Rajiv Singh and Assam Rifles DG Pradeep Chandran Nair joined the meeting at the Ministry of Home Affairs in North Block.The meeting comes a day after Manipur Governor Anusuiya Uike called on Shah at his office and briefed him about the situation in the north-eastern state.Manipur has been witnessing sporadic ethnic violence since May 3 last year following clashes during a rally organised by the All Tribals Students Union to protest against the demand for the inclusion of the Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe category.In fresh violence, several houses belonging to both Meitei and Kuki communities were burned by unknown miscreants in Kotlen following the murder of a person earlier this month, the Manipur police said.Around 600 people from Manipur's Jiribam area are now taking shelter in Assam's Cachar district following fresh violence reported in Manipur's Jiribam area.Notable, the meeting also comes a week after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat expressed concern over peace eluding Manipur even after one year and said the situation in the state must be considered with priorityAddressing a gathering of RSS trainees in Nagpur on June 10, Bhagwat had said: ""Manipur is waiting for peace for the last one year. There was peace in Manipur 10 years ago. It felt like gun culture had finished there. But the state has suddenly seen violence"".""The unrest either got triggered or was triggered, but Manipur is burning and people are facing its extreme heat,"" the RSS chief had said, adding there is a need to get over election rhetoric and focus on problems facing the nation.",Amit Shah chaired a high-level meeting in Delhi to review the security situation in Manipur.

"MP: Trackers refuse to be butchers for Kuno Cheetahs; move on strike, approach CM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trackers-refuse-to-be-butchers-for-kuno-cheetahs-move-on-strike-approach-cm/articleshow/111057018.cms,"BHOPAL: A tense situation has arisen at Kuno National Park (KNP) in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh as around 30 villagers, hired to monitor and track cheetahs round-the-clock, have stopped work. The reason for the strike? Their refusal to butcher animals for feeding the big cats within the special enclosures known as soft release bomas (SRBs).Primarily from the Yadav and Gurjar communities, these villagers were recruited for their knowledge of the park's terrain. However, their religious beliefs clash with the assigned duty of slaughtering goats and buffaloes for the cheetahs. They have vehemently rejected this task and reportedly even refused training offered by the park authorities for the same.This unexpected strike has thrown a wrench into the cheetah tracking program. Park officials are scrambling for alternate solutions, considering outsourcing procurement of pre-cut meat from licensed vendors through tenders. They downplay the immediate impact, assuring that most cheetahs are currently within the secure bomas and can be monitored by existing staff. To facilitate closer monitoring and potentially foster a level of trust, each tracker is assigned a specific cheetah to observe its behaviour within the enclosure. This includes monitoring feeding times, ensuring the cheetah's well-being, and providing enrichment activities where appropriate. While forming close bonds with wild animals is challenging, familiarity can aid in cheetah acclimation and data collection, say sources.“The trackers stopped working and came to Kuno four days ago. They went straight to the Chief Minister's office instead of raising the issue with park or wildlife headquarters first. Currently, most cheetahs are within the secure enclosures and our existing staff can manage them. The villagers' absence won't significantly impact cheetah tracking and monitoring,” an officer told TOI. Trackers are paid around Rs 9000 a month and they work in shifts.Undeterred, the villagers remain resolute in their demands. Their representatives, who approached the Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav's office for intervention, have highlighted two key points: Insurance Coverage and Exemption from Slaughtering Duties. They couldn’t meet the CM but were able to submit their pleas before his OSD – S K Tiwari, who further inquired about the matter from concerned officers.""We're on strike and haven't heard back from park officials. Our demands are clear: we can't participate in the animal preparation for cheetah feeding,"" a tracker said.They seek comprehensive insurance to be protected against any hazards associated with their work in the park, including encounters with wild animals or injuries sustained during tracking activities and their primary objection is the requirement to kill and butcher animals for cheetah feeding. Citing religious beliefs against animal slaughter, they have refused to compromise on this issue, say sources.The villagers have made it clear they will not return to work until their demands are met. This incident lays bare a potential conflict between cultural beliefs and wildlife conservation efforts. Kuno National Park, known for its recent introduction of cheetahs, now faces the challenge of balancing animal welfare with the religious sentiments of its hired workforce. Finding a solution that addresses both concerns is crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of the cheetah monitoring program.The already strained situation at Kuno National Park is often compounded by the continued adventures of cheetahs venturing outside the protected area. The female cheetah Veera had strayed from the park boundaries, venturing further than ever before. It reached Baghwala village, located near the Gwalior-Morena border, a significant distance from the park's core area. That was the first instance of a cheetah venturing so close to a major city. The trackers and officers had spent sleepless nights trying to get it back. Veera isn't the only cheetah exhibiting a penchant for exploration. Another cheetah, Pawan, had also been known to wander outside the park's confines. Just recently, Pawan was retrieved from Karoli in Rajasthan.The trackers have faced conflict situations in the region. In one of the recent incidents, the trackers tasked with locating a cheetah that moved out of the park was attacked by villagers in Burakheda village of Morena. The villagers, mistaking the team for cattle thieves due to their nighttime presence and clothing, opened fire and launched a physical attack. No serious injuries were reported.Kuno is experiencing a mix of triumphs and challenges in its ambitious cheetah reintroduction project since the first lot was translocated from Namibia in Sep 2022 and released into enclosures by PM Narendra Modi . However, a significant milestone had recently been achieved with cheetah Gamini giving birth to five cubs, bringing the total number of Indian-born cheetahs to 13. It was the fourth litter born in India and the first by a South African cheetah. Kuno is now home to 26 cheetahs, with half being cubs.This is a positive sign for the project's progress. Prior to Gamini's cubs, Namibia's Jwala had successfully delivered three cubs in her second litter, following the loss of one from her first litter of four.Additionally, cheetah Aasha had previously contributed three cubs to the growing Kuno population. Since the initial translocation of cheetahs from Namibia in September 2022, ten cheetahs have died. Harsh summer temperatures reaching 46-47 degrees Celsius resulted in the loss of three cubs born to Jwala in May 2023.The growing cheetah population may necessitate the exploration of alternative habitats like the Gandhisagar sanctuary. German researchers have expressed concerns regarding Kuno's cheetah carrying capacity. Determining this will require further study as the cheetahs establish their home ranges.","Around 30 villagers, hired to monitor and track cheetahs round-the-clock, have stopped work.

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were killed and over 50 were injured as a goods train rammed into Kanchanjunga Express on early Monday morning near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal.A passenger of the Sealdah-Kanchanjunga Express, standing beside a damaged coach, recounted that their train was moving at a slow pace as it approached Rangapani, located a short distance from New Jalpaiguri. ""Our train was moving very slowly when it reached Rangapani, a few kilometers from New Jalpaiguri,"" he said.Another traveler described experiencing a sudden, intense jolt accompanied by a loud noise, causing the train to come to an abrupt stop. After exiting the train, the passenger observed that a goods train had collided with their rake from the rear.""We were having tea when the train stopped suddenly with a jerk,"" a passenger recalled. A pregnant woman, who was traveling with her family, mentioned that the impact caused her to fall from her seat.""It felt like an earthquake. It took us some time to collect ourselves and understand what happened,"" she said.An individual from Agartala, who was situated in coach S6 of the Kanchanjunga Express, reported feeling a sudden jolt, followed by the compartment coming to a screeching halt.""My wife, child and I somehow managed to come out of the mangled coach. We are currently stranded... The rescue operations also started quite late,"" the passenger said.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Commissioner of Railway Safety has started a probe into the cause of the accident . He added that measures will be taken to prevent a recurrence of the circumstances that led to the accident.The minister also verified that the rescue efforts at the scene have been concluded.Earlier in the day, Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of the Railway Board, suggested that the collision might have been caused by a potential ""human error"" on the part of the goods train's loco pilot, who died from injuries sustained in the accident. Sinha indicated that the goods train may have ignored a signal and collided with the Kanchanjungha Express, which was traveling from Agartala to Sealdah.(With PTI inputs)",A goods train rammed into Kanchanjunga Express on early Monday morning near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal.

Sources said that BJP is likely to retain the Speaker's post and not offer it to allies as it has far greater numbers than the NDA partners.Since the President has notified June 26 as the date for the Speaker's election, it is expected that the PM will propose the name for a consensus a day in advance, as all Speakers have so far been elected with a consensus.

Consensual relationship is not a licence to assault woman: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-relationship-is-not-a-licence-to-assault-woman-hc/articleshow/111067020.cms,"FIR challenged

BENGALURU: A consensual relationship between the accused and the complainant-woman is not a licence for the former to assault the latter, the high court has observed.Justice M Nagaprasanna, however, quashed the offences of rape and cheating invoked against the petitioner. Both the petitioner and the woman are residents of Bengaluru and worked together in a software company . They were in a relationship for over five years.In July 2022, the woman lodged a police complaint alleging that the man had a physical relationship with her on the promise of marriage but breached it later. Following this, Annapoorneshwari Nagar police registered a case for offences punishable under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 323 (causing hurt), 417 (punishment for cheating), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.The man challenged the FIR and argued that in February 2020, the woman had filed a similar complaint against another person alleging that he also had indulged in sexual acts on the promise of marriage and the same was pending. He claimed that the woman has the habit of filing criminal complaints against different men. On the other hand, the woman remained absent.After perusing the material on record, Justice Nagaprasanna noted the rape and cheating charges cannot be sustained in the wake of consensual relationship.""The facts obtained in the case are considered on the bedrock of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Shambhu Karwar vs State of Uttar Pradesh case. The offence of rape is loosely laid against the petitioner and if further investigation is permitted to continue against the petitioner as is continuing against the other man, it would be permitting the complainant to sail in two different complaints at the same time. Therefore, the offence of rape could not have been laid against the petitioner. It needs to be obliterated,"" the judge said.As regards to assault and criminal intimidation charges, Justice Nagaprasanna noted that a perusal of the wound certificate would indicate that there has been multiple bruises on the body of the complainant.""The bruises are on account of assault allegedly by the accused-petitioner. Therefore, while the offence under section 376 of the IPC or 417 of the IPC cannot be made out, the offence under Sections 323 (causing hurt) and 504 of the IPC are prima facie met,"" the judge observed, while permitting police to investigate those charges.The petitioner can avail of such remedy as is available in law if the investigation leads to filing of the chargesheet against him, the judge added, while partly allowing the petition.",Both the petitioner and the woman are residents of Bengaluru and worked together in a software company.

NEW DELHI: Heat wave to severe heat wave conditions are likely to continue over many parts of north India for the next two days and gradually abate thereafter under the influence of approaching western disturbance towards northwest India , India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.

Northwest India, including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR , which continued to be under heat wave conditions on Monday, may not see significant change in maximum (day) temperatures during the next 24 hours.

Day temperatures may, however, fall by about 2 degree Celsius thereafter as IMD predicted isolated to scattered light rainfall with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during June 18-20.

As far as monsoon is concerned, the Met department said the conditions are favourable for its further advance into some more parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, some parts of Gangetic West Bengal, remaining parts of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and some parts of Bihar during the next four days.

Himachal faces worst fire season in years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himachal-faces-worst-fire-season-in-years/articleshow/111067004.cms,"KULLU: There is no let-up in forest fires in Himachal Pradesh , as 2,004 blazes have already been recorded in what has become one of the worst summers for forests and wildlife across the state.The fires so far have destroyed 22,466 hectares of land and caused an estimated loss of Rs 7.62 crore to the department besides harming and unsettling the wildlife. Compared to last year when only 104 forest fires were recorded in the state during summer , the rise this year is a whopping 1826%.Maximum fires recorded are in regions where average maximum temperature hav been higher this month.According to the forest department data, Dharamshala has recorded the highest 478 fires, followed by Mandi with 328 fires, Hamirpur 243, Nahan 234, Solan 192, Chamba 144 and Shimla 143.Forest circles which have suffered the worst losses include Mandi with Rs 1.89 crore, Dharamshala Rs 1.38 crore, Hamirpur Rs 1.23 crore and Bilaspur Rs 1.10 crore.Ajit Thakur, chief conservator of forests, Mandi Circle, told TOI that there were many reasons for the forest fires but the hot weather tops the list. ""This summer, we have been witnessing 40°C and above temperatures in many of our forest circles in the state.Heat provides ideal conditions for the initial spark off and more than often it's the villagers who deliberately ignite forest fires. It also becomes difficult to put out a forest fire in such high temperatures, which can reach well above 50°C in an area of fire incident. ""The other reason is the pine tree leaf-shedding. In the last two years, there have not been any major fires in Himachal forests and this has resulted in an accumulation of dried leaves and grass, which become highly combustible material in rising mercury. Also, the soil's moisture-holding capacity also decreases in forests due to constant heat and this again is another reason for the fires,"" said Thakur.According to Thakur, better fire-fighting technology was required for the forests of Himachal. ""Technology has made fire detection much easier, but we are still not close to using it to douse fire. Unlike the developed countries where fire fighting is an exclusive department with high reliability on technology, we depend manually on our workforce to put out forest fires. We have used army helicopters only in emergency situations,"" said Thakur. ""Our main target remains to douse a forest fire immediately within the first one to two hours as when it spreads then it becomes uncontrollable,"" added Thakur.Out of the total forest area of 37,033 sq km in Himachal Pradesh, around 17.8% has chir pine forests, which is highly sensitive to forest fires due to their highly inflammable resin content. The state forest department has marked as many as 26 forest divisions, having chir pine trees, in the state, as highly sensitive to forest fires.","The fires have destroyed 22,466 hectares of land and caused an estimated loss of Rs 7.62 crore.

A group of Democrat Senators led by Jeff Merkley, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for a strong diplomatic response, following the ``credible allegations’’ about the involvement of an Indian official in the plot.They asked the US government to match words with action to hold the Indian officials involved accountable, and to send a ``clear message’’ that there will be consequences for such behaviour. ``It is imperative that we take an unequivocal stand against such a threat to the rights of a US citizen and violation of US sovereignty, which are examples of India’s increasingly irresponsible efforts to silence critics of its government among its diaspora around the word,’’ said the senators in their official communication.Gupta, who allegedly hired a hitman to eliminate the Khalistan separatist and US-Canadian national at the instance of an Indian government official, was scheduled to be produced in a Manhattan federal court on Monday. The announcement of his extradition to the US, which has an extradition treaty with the Czech Republic, was made by the Czech justice minister Pavel Blazek. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, 2023.The minister said he approved the extradition on June 3.

This was the first time he met his counterpart Ajit Doval since the US Justice Department announced charges against Gupta.Gupta is charged with murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. Each count carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison.

The issue was raised by President Biden himself in his meeting with PM Modi on the margins of the G20 summit last year in Delhi.Gupta allegedly contacted an individual whom he believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source working with US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder Pannun.",US NSA Jake Sullivan is in India for a review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) The arrival of Sullivan coincided with an announced by the Czech government that Indian national Nikhil Gupta was handed over to the US.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111066970,imgsize-64840,width-400,resizemode-4/111066970.jpg"

The state criminal investigation department (CID) officials on Monday visited the DRI office for a preliminary inquiry.Desai and Sunil Ghodke were detained from the Mumbai-bound Duronto Express following a tip-off when it reached Nagpur station on Saturday, said police. The duo, who allegedly possessed gold valued at more than Rs 2.25 crore, were taken to the DRI office from the railway station. While 483gm of the gold hidden in eight bedsheets was recovered from Desai, the DRI sleuths seized 3kg gold from Ghodke, said a police source.The two were heading to Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai from Kolkata, which is a routine modus operandi of gold smugglers. With spiralling rates, gold smugglers have become active more nowadays to bring cheaper gold from Bengal and sell it to bullion traders of Mumbai, and Itwari in Nagpur.Sources said the DRI sleuths were busy in the investigation when Desai rushed towards the window and jumped off it.

""There were two parcel vans ahead, because of which there was no more damage than what has already happened.""A copy of the PLCT (T/A 912) issued to the loco pilot by the stationmaster of Rangapani surfaced later in the day, authorising him to cross all red signals. ""Automatic signalling has failed and you are hereby authorised to pass all automatic signals between RNI (Rangapani Railway Station) and CAT (Chater Hat Junction),"" the note states.A railway official said a loco pilot was required to approach a red signal at 10 kmph, halt close to the signal, wait a minute during daytime and two minutes at night, and then resume at 10-15 kmph. ""Also, after passing the signal, the loco pilot must ensure that a minimum distance of 150 metres is maintained between his train and the preceding one or any obstruction along the line.""Various reports suggested that the automatic signalling system on the Rangapani stretch of the route, around 30km from New Jalpaiguri station, had been malfunctioning for some time, necessitating the use of PLCT as an alternative.""Employees manning the control rooms were aware of the snag as stationmasters on that stretch would issue paper signals for all passing trains. Two trains couldn't have entered the same track without receiving a PLCT for that specific line,"" a source said.A PLCT is a document that allows trains to proceed on a single line section when a block instrument fails but communication between stations is still available.The stationmaster, after coordinating with the up and down stations, gives the all-clear to an oncoming train. The signal man holds up a racket-like contraption containing the chit of paper for the loco pilot's assistant to collect even as the train is in motion.""Only a detailed inquiry can reveal what actually happened. The question doing the rounds is whether a PLCT each was at all issued to the trains that collided. Why would a loco pilot disregard a PLCT?"" a retired railway engineer wondered.PTI reported that the automatic signalling system between Rantipatra station and Chattar Hat junction, where the goods train hit the Kanchanjunga Express , had been defective since 5.40am Monday.But sources said the snag occurred much before that because of inclement weather.According to norms, the driver who is issued a PLCT is supposed to stop the train for a minute at each defective signal and then proceed at a speed not higher than 10kmph.V Balachandran, central organising secretary of the All-India Loco Running Staff Association, said that until the Commissioner of Railway Safety's report or the departmental fact-finding inquiry came to a conclusion, it was not advisable to put the blame on anyone. ""It will influence the inquiry to divert it as an error by the loco pilot in the eyes of the public and other railwaymen,"" he said.The assistant loco pilot of the goods train survived the collision but is not in a condition to have his statement recorded, officials said.","A copy of the PLCT (T/A 912) issued to the loco pilot by the stationmaster of Rangapani surfaced later in the day, authorising him to cross all red signals.
