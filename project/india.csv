India steps up training of foreign military personnel to boost ties

India expands defence partnerships by training foreign military personnel from Gulf countries, Africa, and Asean. Indian Navy hosts foreign trainees on warships and in establishments, strengthening military ties globally.

Biden to pardon US military personnel convicted of homosexuality

Initiated in September 2023, the US defense department's review aims to rectify past injustices against service members affected by the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy's repeal, ensuring justice for impacted individuals.

China coast guard personnel a 'band of barbarians', says Philippine navy official

US, Britain, and Canada condemn China's actions in the South China Sea, as discussed by Antony Blinken and Enrique Manalo.

NEW DELHI: From basic infantry skills and seamanship to operating advanced weapon systems and platforms like diesel-electric submarines and supersonic fighter jets, India is further cranking up the training of foreign military personnel to strengthen defence partnerships with different countries.The focus is on training cadets and personnel from “friendly foreign countries” in the Gulf, the ASEAN , and Africa, apart of course from the neighbourhood, in the various Indian military establishments and academies.As part of the ongoing military outreach to Gulf countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, for instance, as many as 76 Saudi cadets have now begun sea training at the Southern Naval Command (SNC) at Kochi.The trainees from the King Fahad Naval Academy of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) have joined the Indian Navy’s first training squadron for the four-week programme, which comes after Saudi navy chief Admiral Fahad Abdullah S Al-Ghofaily’s visit here in january this year.“The curriculum ranges from basic seamanship activities to simulator-based training during the harbour phase. The sea phase will focus on practical exposure to nuances of life at sea,” an officer said. This is the second such RSNF batch after the first included 55 cadets in May-June last year.Similarly, military personnel from 26 countries in Africa, where China has made huge strategic inroads, regularly attend courses in the Indian Army’s establishments and pre-commissioning training academies.“The Army trains around 3,100 foreign personnel from over 100 countries every year, which includes about 450 from African countries,” another officer said. The Army even offers special training packages in its establishments like the counterinsurgency and jungle warfare school at Vairengte in Mizoram.The Navy, in turn, provides training to at least 300 foreign trainees at its various training establishments or on-board warships at any given time. “At present, 14 naval schools are training students from more than 20 different countries,” the officer said. There were, for instance, 10 foreign cadets at the passing out parade of the Indian Naval Academy in Ezhimala last month.India has also been steadily deepening military ties with ASEAN countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines through regular joint exercises, military exchanges, arms sales and training programmes, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.India, for instance, has trained Malaysian pilots to fly Russian-origin Sukhoi-30 jets and Vietnamese sailors to operate Kilo-class submarines. India also provides its military facilities and ranges for Singapore’s army and air force to train under special five-year bilateral pacts.“Training personnel from other countries is a very important aspect of military diplomacy. It strengthens India's foreign cooperation, while also showcasing our world-class military training facilities,” a senior officer said.India, of course, is also trying to step up its exports of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and lightweight Tejas fighters, among other military hardware and software.","India is cranking up the training of foreign military personnel to strengthen defence partnerships with different countries.

"Every second Indian adult physically inactive, fails WHO guidelines: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-second-indian-adult-physically-inactive-fails-who-guidelines-study/articleshow/111300179.cms,"TIMESVIEW Inactivity can lead to both physical and mental issues. Unfortunately, modern office work often doesn't encourage physical activity. The report rightly reasserts the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle. We must prioritise the wellness of our own body, take time out to take care of it. There’s no better investment than yourself.

NEW DELHI: Nearly 50% of Indian adults are unfit and fail to adhere to World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for adequate physical activity , according to a study published in medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday.The research, conducted across 197 countries and territories from 2000 to 2022, highlighted a significant gender disparity, with 52.6% of women and 38.4% men found physically inactive in 2022. The most concerning aspect of the findings was the dramatic increase in the prevalence of insufficient physical activity among Indian adults, which surged from 22.4% in 2000 to 45.4% in 2022. If the trend of 2010-22 continues, levels of inactivity are projected to rise to 55% by 2030.To maintain optimal health, WHO recommends adults to engage in “150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or equivalent, per week”. Failing to meet these guidelines can lead to serious health consequences. Physically inactive adults are more susceptible to developing various cardiovascular diseases and face an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, dementia and breast and colon cancer.According to city-based doctors, the lack of physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food are among major factors contributing to the rise in li- festyle-related diseases. With everything available on mobile phones, people have stopped going to markets, further reducing physical movement. The availability of snacks and beverages within the office has also limited the need for employees to move around. Thissedentary lifestyle affects all age groups.“In our OPD, we see a substantial number of patients with orthopaedic issues related to sedentary lifestyles and poor diets. In a month, the number of such patients ranges between 15 and 25. This indicates that these conditions are prevalent and increasing,” said Dr Hitesh Bhandari, consultant, orthopaedics, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre.He added, “Sedentary lifestyles and consumption of junk food are key contributors to diseases. These include osteoporosis, where a lack of weight-bearing exercise can lead to weaker bones, and osteoarthritis, which is exacerbated by obesity caused by poor diet and inactivity. Chronic lower back pain is another common issue, resulting from poor posture and weak core muscles due to inactivity. Adults aged 40-65 are most affected by a sedentary lifestyle in terms of orthopaedic health . This age group often has desk jobs and establishes sedentary habits, leading to musculoskeletal problems.”Dr Balbir Singh, group chairman, cardiac sciences, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, emphasised the significant health risks associated with a sedentary lifes- tyle, particularly in relation to cardiovascular diseases, which affect both the heart and the brain. These ailments are a major concern for people who engage in minimal physical activity. A sedentary lifestyle is also linked to issues like hypertension, diabetes and obesity.“The consequences of a sedentary lifestyle are more pronounced in older age groups, particularly those aged 40 and above. However, in recent years, there has been a significant change in the lifestyle habits of younger groups. The younger generation is also being impacted, as many work on computers and avoid in-person interactions. Online meetings and lack of walking are becoming prevalent among them. At least 80% of the people who visit my OPD lead a sedentary lifestyle,” said Dr Singh.Women tend to lead a more inactive lifestyle compared to men, he added. Many women believe working in the kitchen and performing household chores constitute significant physical activity, and they often claim to be very active as a result. However, this perception is inaccurate, he said.Dr Anoop Saraya, a gastroenterologist from ILBS, said annual check-ups and corporate health screenings have been instrumental in identifying health issues through incidental findings.“Individuals with fatty liver are at a higher risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can progress to liver fibrosis, scarring and cell destruction. In advanced stages, this condition may lead to cirrhosis, and those with cirrhotic liver have a higher likelihood of developing liver cancer compared to the general population. The progression from fatty liver to liver malignancy can span over 20-25 years,” he said, adding genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in the development of certain diseases. When coupled with unhealthy eating habits, the risk of developing these conditions increases.According to Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology department at Delhi State Cancer Institute, “There is an increasing trend of cancer incidence in the younger population. Breast and colon cancers are directly or indirectly affected by a sedentary lifestyle.”The sedentary nature of modern lifestyles, characterised by prolonged periods of sitting and minimal exercise, has been identified as a significant risk factor for cancer occurrence across all age groups, particularly among young people, she said.“Insufficient exercise can contribute to psychological issues, and there is a correlation between eating unhealthy food and experiencing anxiety and depression,” said Dr Praveen Gupta, principal director and chief of neurology, Fortis Hospital.A sedentary lifestyle may negatively impact a person’s mental well-being. Moreover, the consumption of nutrientpoor, high-calorie foods has been associated with increased levels of stress and low mood.","Nearly 50% of Indian adults are unfit and fail to adhere to World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for adequate physical activity.

India must aim to lower cost of access to space: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-must-aim-to-lower-cost-of-access-to-space-isro-chief/articleshow/111296895.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro chairman S Somanath on Wednesday said that India must aim to lower the cost of access to space as it could boost small satellite launches and attract new participants in the space sector .At the third Annual India Space Congress (ISC) 2024 here, which saw the participation of delegates from over 300 global space organisations and 30 countries, the Isro chief said, “Bringing down the cost of access to space is a global trend, and India must also look at it. Space can never be solely for business and economy; it must inspire generations to innovate for humanity.” he said. “Isro has created significant space capability and talent in the country. It’s time for new actors to scale India’s space operations,” he added.The Isro chief also said that there is not enough internal demand for the satellite-launch market in India but it can be created through more work on the application of satellite technology . He said big companies are willing to enter the space sector but they are concerned about the timeline. “When I talk to many of those industries who are willing to come and set up facilities, they are all very ready to do it. But they are asking when they are going to break even and where the orders are so that they can safely invest in this. I think this is a big question. It is the bigger challenge of convincing investors to come in a big way in big state projects,” the Isro chief said.Somanath mentioned that PM Narendra Modi’s vision for Amrit Kaal includes extending human space activity beyond the Gaganyaan mission, with the goal of landing on the Moon by 2040. However, he said India’s current rockets are not sufficient for round trips to the Moon. Developing rockets with higher payload capacity is essential for both bringing back samples and future human missions, the Isro chairman said. “Though GSLV MKIII (LVM3) is the biggest rocket that we have, it is not big enough. We need to develop the capability to bring samples back and then send humans to the Moon and bring them back,” he said.The Isro chief also mentioned Gsat-20, a high-throughput Ka-band satellite, with over 50gbps high bandwidth connectivity capacity, is set to be launched in mid-Aug onboard Space X’s Falcon 9 and it has received clearance to be moved to the US for launch.","Isro chairman S Somanath said that India must aim to lower the cost of access to space as it could boost small satellite launches and attract new participants in the space sector. “Isro has created significant space capability and talent in the country.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.

But Afghanistan, at this stage of their cricketing journey, are playing for one another like I have never seen anything like this,"" said Ashwin.The commitment of the Afghan team paid off as they defeated Bangladesh by eight runs using the DLS method in their final Super Eight match, earning four points and advancing to the semi-finals.",India cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin has shared his perspective on the controversial incident involving Afghanistan's Gulbadin Naib.

When the opposition tried to persuade it, TMC said it will convey its decision on Wednesday morning, ahead of the Speaker's election. The decision to allow a voice vote, sources said, suggested that TMC did not give a favourable response to vote division. However, there was much confusion over the issue later.Congress came out clearly that it did not seek physical voting. AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, ""INDIA alliance exercised the democratic right to propose K Suresh for the post of Speaker and a voice vote was taken. After that, INDIA could have pressed for vote division, but did not, because INDIA wanted a consensus to strengthen the spirit of cooperation which is so lacking in the actions of PM and NDA.""But TMC's Abhishek Banerjee and Kalyan Banerjee told reporters that several members had sought voting, but the pro-tem Speaker did not allow the division because the govt did not have the numbers to win the election. Abhishek called it ""immoral"".Meanwhile, Congress is seriously considering forcing a contest for the post of Deputy Speaker, peeved as it is with the govt's attitude on the issue.However, sources said the process for the post will take some time and a decision will be taken then.","Congress-led opposition did not press for division of votes during the Speaker's election.

HYDERABAD: Telugu students packing their bags for the US this fall are more likely to feel at home than before. There has been an explosion in the Telugu-speaking population across America , from 3.2 lakh in 2016 to 12.3 lakh in 2024.According to a Statistical Atlas of the US report based on US Census Bureau data this population ranges from fourth-generation immigrants to recently-arrived students. California hosts the largest Telugu-speaking population - of close to 2 lakh - closely followed by Texas (1.5 lakh) and New Jersey (1.1 lakh). States like Illinois (83,000), Virginia (78,000), and Georgia (52,000) too have a significant pool of people from the two Telugu states. Data shows each of these states have seen an almost four-fold rise in numbers. Local Telugu associations say these numbers are in line with their own estimates.Between 60,000 and 70,000 students arrive in the US each year, along with close to 10,000 H1B visa holders. About 80% of them are registered with us, said Ashok Kolla, former secretary of the Telugu Association of North America. ""Over 75% of them settle here in the US, mostly in Dallas, the Bay Area, North Carolina, New Jersey, Atlanta, Florida, and Nashville.""The older generations are largely entrepreneurs, whereas over 80% of the younger lot are in IT and finance. Telugu influence has seen such a rise that it is now the 11th most spoken foreign language - out of 350 languages - in the US, and the third most spoken Indian language, preceded by Hindi and Gujarati.""When I moved to Dallas last year, I felt right at home,"" said Vinay K, who moved to Texas for a data analyst's job. ""From my PG to my office, from streets to malls, I was surrounded by Telugus. Most of my colleagues from India are from AP and Telangana, which helped me settle down and not feel homesick,"" the young professional said.Old-timers recount how communities around them have seen a shift in the ethnic composition over the years. ""I don't remember knowing more than four or five Telugu families when I first moved. But over the years the community has grown significantly. It's like we have a third state after AP and Telangana in the US. There are more footfalls in temples and community spaces now,"" said T Raghavendra Rao, a 63-year-old businessman who's lived in NJ for over five decades.According to the Indian Mobility Report 2024, AP and Telangana form the largest cohort of Indian students in the US - accounting for 12.5% of the total student crowd.

PATNA: Sanjiv Mukhiya, the Nalanda horticulture college employee identified as one of the absconding perpetrators of the NEET-UG paper leak in Bihar , is a repeat offender with a network of collaborators that includes the arrested kingpin of a UP ""solver gang"", investigators revealed Wednesday.Mukhiya, it transpired, unofficially took time off from his job as a technical assistant at the state-run Noorsarai Horticulture College in Nalanda from May 6 to 14 and got himself admitted to a hospital. He went missing after word got out about his alleged role in the paper leak ahead of the May 5 test. Sources in the Economic Offences Unit said Mukhiya had links with Ravi Atri, who was jailed in Meerut after being arrested in April for the police constable recruitment exam paper leak.Officials at Noorsarai Horticulture College said Mukhiya didn't report for duty on the day of the NEET-UG test and has been marked as absent without authorised leave since.In his response to a notice from the college on May 18, he claimed to have been hospitalised on May 6 due to a sudden illness. He requested leave until June 5, totalling 31 days. The college wrote back with queries to which he was supposed to respond within three days.The institute's office superintendent Pranay Kumar Pankaj said, ""Mukhiya has been posted in the college for seven years. When we heard he was a suspect in the NEET-UG paper leak, we summoned him through another letter on June 20, but received no response."" Pankaj mentioned that an EOU team visited the campus for questioning.A senior EOU official said Mukhiya previously collaborated with Ranjit Don, the alleged mastermind of several paper leaks from the 1990s till early 2000. Mukhiya allegedly branched out after Ranjit joined politics. ""Mukhiya operated as a link between candidates' parents, middlemen, handlers and the solver gang.

The Emergency attack

BJP stamp on government

Continuity vs Change

Balance on policy issues

Working with the 'Shehzada'

NEW DELHI: PM Modi-led NDA government on Wednesday won the first battle of numbers on the floor of 18th Lok Sabha as ruling NDA candidate Om Birla was re-elected Speaker with a voice vote. Opposition's INDIA bloc, despite all its posturing, did not press for division of votes - a candid admission of lack of numbers on their side.Ever since the results were declared on June 4, there have been talks of change in the character of the 18th Lok Sabha.AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi reflected the opinion of many in the opposition camp when he said today that the ruing BJP will not be able to ""steamroll"" the opposition as the character of the House has changed in new Lok Sabha. With the BJP failing to secure a majority on its own, the number dynamics in the Lower House has indeed changed. Prime Minister Modi is now dependent on allies for the survival of his government. But has that made any perceptible change in the way Modi 3.0 has functioned since it took oath on June 9? Well, the answer is both ""yes"" and ""no.""The election of Om Birla as Speaker of Lok Sabha had the stamp of authority which was trademark of both Modi 1.0 and Modi 2.0. With the firm support of allies, the government did not let opposition dictate terms on Speaker's election and refused to enter into any negotiations over the choice of deputy speaker. While the opposition wanted a commitment on deputy speaker's post, the government sent out a clear message: ""First, you support Speaker's election, and after that, we can discuss about the Deputy Speaker."" The stalemate ensured an election for Lok Sabha Speaker - something that had happened only three times till now - in 1952, 1967, and 1976.The invoking of ""dark days of Emergency"" by Prime Minister Modi and other top NDA leaders ahead of Parliament session was another signature BJP strategy - seen several times in the last 10 years of NDA rule - to not just put the opposition under pressure but also to isolate Congress within the INDIA bloc. With the Congress and INDIA bloc leaders carrying forward their poll campaign of ""Save Constitution"" to put the BJP on the backfoot, saffron party's ""Emergency"" counter attack was a well-planned move to keep the narrative around Constitution but with a different take. With Speaker Om Birla joining the government in attacking Emergency, the opposition's hopes of any perceptible change in government's functioning due to reduced numbers - may remain just that.When PM Modi took oath for a record third term in office, the belief was that allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) would walk away with plum portfolios in bargain for their crucial support to run Modi 3.0. There were also reports that TDP wanted the Speaker's post. However, that did not happen. The BJP has not yielded too much of space to allies and has kept almost all the important portfolios with itself.Modi 3.0 has been marked by continuity, unlike Modi 2.0 when change was perhaps the only constant. Prime Minister Modi has retained most of his top ministers and even his top officers. He has also not changed the portfolios of key ministers. The choice of Speaker also signalled this spirit of continuity. This is in contrast to 2019, when Prime Minister Modi had returned to power with an overwhelming majority of 303 seats, and his Cabinet and council of ministers saw several changes. In 2019, the BJP selected Om Birla as Speaker replacing Sumitra Mahajan who presided over Lok Sabha during Modi 1.0.And while the BJP imprint has been strong till now, the saffron party will have to tread a cautious path when it will come to policies of Modi 3.0. Even before the countours of government was finalised, allies went public with their reservations on the Agniveer scheme, which was a flagship policy of Modi 2.0. The caste census is another issue on which the allies would have a different perspective. During campaigning, the BJP had teared into the Congress over reservations given to Muslims in Karnataka. However, in TDP, the BJP has an ally which openly supports the idea and is all set to implement it in Andhra Pradesh.Prime Minister Modi may have avoided taking the name of Rahul Gandhi in the last 10 years and referred to the Congress leader as Shehzada. However, the changed number dynamics has now made the former Congress chief an integral part of government's functioning for the first time. We saw the first glimpse of this today when Rahul accompanied PM Modi to escort Om Birla to the Speaker's chair. Also, as leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi will be part of several parliamentary bodies and panels for key appointments that are headed by Prime Minister. Rahul may still not have a say in their functioning, but he will be privy to all the discussions.While the BJP wants to drive home the point that Modi 3.0 is firmly in the saddle and it is business as usual, just like the first two terms of the Prime Minister, the opposition knows that Modi government is now completely dependent on crucial support provided by two key allies. The upcoming Budget may see some incentives, extra grants or even a special category status for Chandrababu Naidu's Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar's Bihar. For Naidu and Nitish, these perks would be of far greater importance than any possible leverage at Centre.

Along with this, we appreciate the determination of all those people who strongly opposed the Emergency, fought an unprecedented struggle and took the responsibility of protecting the democracy of India,"" he further said.The motion, mirroring PM Narendra Modi's condemnation of the Emergency on the inaugural day of the session, caught Congress unawares, splitting it not just from allies like SP and DMK whose leaders were victims of Emergency's excesses but also, surprisingly, TMC, a breakaway unit.When Birla started reading out the resolution that specifically named Indira Gandhi and Congress for the assault on ""Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution, illegal arrests, press censorship and other excesses"", only Congress MPs protested from the aisle while the rest of the opposition, including SP and TMC, remained seated. Congress's allies also joined in the two-minute silence urged by the speaker to express solidarity with the victims of Emergency and to ""remind the younger generation"" of what happened in the 21 months of the Emergency.Besides the embarrassment to Congress, the swift move was significant also in that it again indicated BJP's resolve to pay Congress back in the ""Constitution-in-danger"" coin that Rahul Gandhi effectively used during the election campaign, as well as its willingness to pick and widen gaps in the INDIA bloc.""This is the 50th anniversary of the Emergency. It is our collective duty to create awareness about all historic events. Awareness towards the Constitution will only strengthen when the young generation knows about democracy,"" Birla said, adding that post-facto ratification of Emergency was done by the cabinet on June 26 fifty years ago.Endorsing Birla for his resolution on the Emergency, Modi said on X, ""I am glad that the speaker strongly condemned the Emergency, highlighted the excesses committed during that time and also mentioned the manner in which democracy was strangled. It was also a wonderful gesture to stand in silence in honour of all those who suffered during those days.""The PM said Emergency was imposed 50 years ago but it was important for today's youth to know about it because it remained a fitting example of what happened when the Constitution was trampled, public opinion was stifled and institutions were destroyed.""The happenings during the Emergency exemplified what a dictatorship looks like,"" Modi said, a reassertion of what Birla said in the resolution and seen as a bid to deflate Congress's ""save democracy"" campaign.Later, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju framed the issue as one between those who supported the atrocities during Emergency on the one hand and those who sympathised with those who resisted the ""imposition of dictatorship"".","Lok Sabha condemned the Emergency clamped by the Indira Gandhi govt to silence protests.

NEW DELHI: Noting that the threat from nuclear weapons has once again occupied centerstage in the geopolitical landscape , chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday said that the ""uniqueness"" of India's nuclear trajectory is premised on the principle of ""no first-use and massive retaliation"".

There is an urgent need for ""a deeper thought, development of new doctrines, reimagining deterrence and safeguarding nuclear C4I2SR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, information, surveillance and reconnaissance) infrastructure"", he said while addressing a seminar here on 'Nuclear Strategy: Contemporary Developments and Future Possibilities'.

Delivering the keynote address on 'Nuclear Strategy: Contemporary Developments and Future Possibilities' at a seminar here, Gen Chauhan also highlighted the changing nature and characteristics of conventional warfare.

The speech comes soon after the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) on June 17 held that China was boosting its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country around the globe. China now has 500 warheads, up from 410 in January 2023, while India has 172 and Pakistan 170, as per SIPRI.

India even retains the option to retaliate with nuclear weapons if its forces ""anywhere"" are attacked with biological or chemical weapons, as per the doctrine.

The sea phase will focus on practical exposure to nuances of life at sea,"" an officer said. This is the second such RSNF batch after the first included 55 cadets in May-June last year. Similarly, military personnel from 26 countries in Africa, where China has made huge strategic inroads, regularly attend courses in Indian Army's establishments and pre-commissioning training academies.""The Army trains around 3,100 foreign personnel from over 100 countries every year, which includes about 450 from African countries,"" another officer said.

Crucially, many MPs including AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi said the opposition has better strength than in the past, and ""BJP won't be able to steamroll."" National Conference MP Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi lamented that a Muslim MP was called a terrorist in the last LS, which was a blot on the Chair's record. As the expected bonhomie disappeared quickly, Birla even had to cut short some members and admonish some.On his first day as the leader of opposition and dressed in white kurta instead of his trademark T-shirt, Rahul Gandhi warmly escorted Birla to the Chair in company with PM Narendra Modi. But his short speech in English, measured in tone in contrast to the decibel levels and rhetoric of his past interventions, drove home that ""cooperation happens on the basis of trust"".He said, ""This House represents the voice of India's people and you, Speaker sir, are the final arbiter of that voice ... the opposition also represents the voice of India's people and this time, the opposition represents significantly more voice of the Indian people than it did last time."" He said the Speaker will be defending the Constitution by helping the opposition.In what sounded like a riposte to Modi lavishing praise on Birla for overseeing record business in the 17th LS, Rahul said the issue is how much of ""India's voice"" is heard in the House, and not how efficiently it is run. ""The idea that you can run the House efficiently by silencing the voice of the opposition is a non-democratic idea ... This election has shown that the people of India expect the opposition to defend the Constitution.""The words, at once laced with plea for Chair's indulgence and warning of opposition's intent, were echoed by Akhilesh Yadav who, speaking in easy Hindi, conveyed the message with two terse comments - ""your control should be on the treasury benches too, as it is always there on the opposition"" and ""the House should run on your directions, and not the opposite"".""We believe you will move forward without discrimination... You are the chief justice of the court of democracy...actions like suspensions which hurt the dignity of the House will not be taken,"" he said. Baalu said, ""Kindly be impartial, impartial, impartial."" TMC's Bandopadhyay recalled the suspension of 150 MPs in a day, to the jeers of ""shame"" from the INDIA benches. He also asserted that secularism and harmony should be upheld.While slamming the absence of condolence and tears on issues like Manipur, Covid deaths, farm suicides, Sena's Sawant remarked that the House wants ""harmony, not hatred"". The NC MP slammed the ""hasty"" passage of the bill for nullification of Article 370.Akhilesh regretted that the new Parliament building has ""lowered"" the Chair of the Speaker, while it is ""very high"" in the ""House"" he just was, a reference to the UP assembly. Though it mentioned a fact, it was also viewed as sarcasm in view of the day's context.","Congress' Rahul Gandhi, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Sudip Bandopadhyay (TMC), T R Baalu (DMK), Arvind Sawant (Shiv Sena-UBT), Supriya Sule (NCP-SP), N K Premachandran, made biting comments.

NEW DELHI: In a rare meeting with Myanmar deputy PM and foreign minister U Than Shwe, who transited through Delhi on Wednesday, EAM S Jaishankar expressed deep concern about the impact of continuing violence and instability in Myanmar on the Indian border. Jaishankar said he particularly flagged illegal narcotics , arms smuggling and trafficking of persons as priority challenges and sought cooperation for early return of Indian nationals trapped in Myawaddy.

He said India is open to engaging all stakeholders in addressing this situation and pressed for credible security protection for India's projects in Myanmar. ""Urged early return to the path of democratic transition in Myanmar. India stands ready to help in any manner,"" the EAM said.

This was possibly the first time there was an acknowledgement publicly by India about its engagement with a senior leader of the military junta. In a tough diplomatic stance, India has maintained ties with the regime because of the need to cooperate for checking activities of insurgents active in border areas.

NEW DELHI: The US has been consistently asking New Delhi for updates on its probe into the alleged involvement of an Indian official in the murder-for-hire plot against Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , as it seeks accountability from India, deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell said on Wednesday.Campbell, who met foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra and deputy NSA Vikrim Misri during his visit to India last week, further said ""Indian colleagues"" are looking carefully at what potential ""institutional reforms"" might be necessary in the wake of some of the allegations and reports in the media.He was responding to a question on whether the US would accept the unconfirmed 'rogue agent theory' reported in the media.The remarks are significant as India has so far said nothing about the outcome of its probe. Campbell said India has been responsive to concerns raised by the US about the foiled attempt to murder Pannun, a US national.According to Campbell, the two countries are presently having a constructive dialogue on the issue. ""We've made clear that we seek accountability from the govt of India,"" he said in a virtual interaction with Indian journalists from Washington. ""And we have consistently asked for updates on the Indian investigation. And I would just simply say we raised the issues directly with the Indian govt at the most senior levels.""Campbell was in India last week with NSA Jake Sullivan for talks mainly focused on the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). This is the first time either of them has spoken publicly about the plot since the visit. The US has officially not confirmed if the Pannun issue was raised in Sullivan and Campbell's engagements here.Asked if India's ties with Russia could come in the way of cooperation in sensitive technology sectors, Campbell said the US has expressed concern about it and the two sides remain clear what areas are affected by the continued military relationship between India and Russia.""I think we will take what steps we can to mitigate some of those engagements. And we have expressed some concerns, but at the same time, we have confidence and trust in India and we're seeking to advance our partnership in technology,"" said the official.""I do want to underscore that the US and India are both great powers. We have many areas of alignment, but it is not surprising that there would be areas where we had different perspectives. And I think in the context of our strategic partnership, what's been important is our ability to share views on areas where we occasionally have disagreement, and seek where possible to narrow those areas where there are differences,"" added Campbell.",The US has been consistently asking for updates on its probe into the alleged involvement of an Indian official in the murder-for-hire plot against Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.
