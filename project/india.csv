Juna akhara to probe don’s ‘initiation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juna-akhara-to-probe-dons-initiation/articleshow/113209198.cms,"HARIDWAR: Juna Akhara , the largest body of Naga seers, has formed a seven-member committee to investigate the initiation of underworld don Prakash Pandey into monkhood inside Almora jail earlier this month, with a report due within three months. The committee convened a meeting at Nagina in Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh , to determine their next steps.Pandey, also known as PP, was allegedly initiated by five seers claiming to be from Juna Akhara, who anointed him 'Swami Prakashanand Giri'.Sources said the akhara also entrusted Pandey with responsibilities for some ashrams in Uttarakhand.However, Mahant Hari Giri , the international president of Juna Akhara, denied the allegations, stating that there is a detailed process to become a seer in the akhara. He added that action will be taken once the committee submits its findings after three months.Meanwhile, activists have raised concerns about the duration of the probe. Ratanmani Dobhal , an activist, told TOI, ""Pandey is not an undertrial but a convict serving a life sentence. How can someone in his position become a seer, especially a Naga seer, which involves a rigorous and complex process? Why has the akhara formed a committee and given it three months? This appears to be an illegal appointment."" In addition to his life sentence, Pandey faces multiple court cases, including those related to extortion, robbery, and murder.This is not the first time Juna Akhara has anointed a controversial figure. In 2012, just before the Kumbh Mela, Radhe Ma was appointed as Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhara, only to be later listed as a ""fake seer"". Other contentious appointments include Golden Baba , who also faced several criminal charges.","Pandey, also known as PP, was allegedly initiated by five seers claiming to be from Juna Akhara.

He apprised the govt that since there is no stipulation in the Abkari Act and rules to grant such permission, the issuance of a one-time sanction for the acquisition of liquor from the Bevco warehouse in Ernakulam , in relaxation of rules, may be contemplated, as it is a solicitation from the govt of Lakshadweep.Govt scrutinised the matter and decided to confer a one-time sanction to Lakshadweep for the bulk procurement of liquor from the Bevco warehouse and transportation of the same from Kochi or Beypore port to Bengaram Island , by relaxing the rules. Lakshadweep has been endeavouring to capitalise on its tourism potential in a major way, especially after last year's India-Maldives row. There was a deliberate attempt from the Centre to promote Lakshadweep, for which even Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to the Union territory.Availability of liquor has been a concern for the tourists to the place. Though there are limitations in the availability of liquor in Lakshadweep, it is not fully proscribed there. Liquor is sold in the capital Kavaratti and Bangaram Atoll islands, which is an island exclusively for tourism purposes. Also, sales of liquor are limited to tourists and govt officials only in Lakshadweep.State govt anticipates such requests in the future too, for which the excise department will have to make amendments to the rules.

""You go to India, you look at the phones, you look at the furniture, you look at the clothes... you will see 'Made in China', that's a fact,"" he said, adding that America, Europe and India had given up on the idea of production that creates jobs and had handed it to China. tnnRahul Gandhi said Bangladesh too had wiped India clean in textile production.

Their joint participation in the exercise demonstrates the growing focus on cross-domain cooperation, with land, sea and air forces working together to face modern challenges,” an officer said.India is showcasing the homegrown single-engine Tejas during its largest-ever air combat exercise Tarang Shakti, in which 67 fighters and military aircraft from 10 countries and observers from another 18 are taking part. The aim is to strengthen India’s military interoperability and strategic partnerships across the globe.Tejas is crucial for the IAF to make up its depleting numbers, grappling as it is with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42 are authorised to tackle China and Pakistan. IAF, however, has till now inducted only 35-36 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 jets ordered for Rs 8,802 crore due to delays by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics(HAL).There is also a major ongoing delay in the delivery timeframe of the next 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets to IAF, contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore contract in Feb 2021. A major reason for this is the delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines, which currently power the jets, to HAL by US firm General Electric.All this comes at a time when another Rs 67,000 crore contract for 97 more Tejas Mark-1A fighters is also being finalized. The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council in Nov last year had given the preliminary nod or acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the acquisition of these 97 jets.India and the US, of course, are now also conducting the techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and HAL for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.","The IAF, Army and Navy vice-chiefs took to the skies in indigenous Tejas fighters on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Suspecting a cover-up attempt after discovery of the body of the raped and murdered doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Hospital and Medical College , Supreme Court Monday asked Bengal govt how a ""vital document"" referring the body for postmortem examination could be missing from the files and how a doctor could carry out the procedure without that document.This aspect, which had escaped the notice of CBI , Bengal govt and the court, was raised by a counsel who said Kolkata Police could not have sent the body for autopsy without filling mandatory details about the body and clothes to the doctor, who would proceed only after receiving this document.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra immediately acknowledged the cruciality of this document in the chain of events.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI in SC in RG Kar rape-murder, said Kolkata Police had not handed over to the central agency the report of the cops detailing the state of the victim's body and clothes as found in the crime scene.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma, for West Bengal, conceded that files of Kolkata Police brought by their officers did not contain this document. ""The chief judicial magistrate filled the form himself and gave it to the doctor,"" Sibal said.The CJI asked, ""How can a postmortem be carried out without this document?"" Justice Pardiwala said, ""The constable who takes the body for postmortem is bound to carry this document. It has been struck blank. You need to explain. If this document is found missing, then something is vitally wrong.""He said, ""This document is crucial (to investigation) and of vital importance as it would have recorded the clothes and garments worn by the victim at the time of crime with which the body was sent for postmortem. It is impossible for the doctor, who conducts postmortem, to accept the body without this document."" Sibal said the state will file an affidavit giving details on this.The counsel, who first drew the court's attention to this missing document, informed the bench that this paper was part of the CD that was handed over to the HC. The SG said the possibility of some documents being generated subsequently could not be ruled out.The CJI also asked whether CBI had been handed over the entire CCTV footage, starting from the time the victim entered the seminar hall for rest, and containing entry and exit of the accused from the crime scene and discovery of the body? The SG said, ""What is shared with CBI is four video clips of CCTV footage totalling just 27 minutes between 5.06pm to 10.45pm.""Senior advocate Geeta Luthra alleged vandals who went on a rampage inside RG Kar hospital disturbed the crime scene. Another counsel said the wash basin and tiles on the walls of the toilet next to the crime scene had been completely replaced, obliterating every possible evidence that could have been picked by forensic experts.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said despite lapse of time, there was no clarity on how the crime happened and the site of the crime.The CJI-led bench said, ""There is some clarity about when the body was discovered and there is some clarity about movement around the room where the woman doctor was resting in the night."" Jethmalani said the person who discovered the body should have registered the FIR, but the delay started from there.The court raised questions about timing of registration of 'unnatural death report' and other documents relating to the crime and asked CBI to investigate these. ""But one thing is loud and clear, there has been at least a 14-hour delay in registration of FIR, which was done at 11.30pm after the body was cremated,"" the bench said.The SG drew the court's attention to the report of forensic science laboratory Kolkata on the incident and said, ""There is something serious. CBI has taken a decision to send the samples for fresh forensic examination by AIIMS and FSLs in other states. Who took the samples is important. In a rape-murder case, the first five hours of the crime scene.""After perusing CBI probe status report, the CJI-led bench said, ""CBI appears to have certain leads. We have understood the line of investigation but do not want to discuss it in open court. CBI should file a fresh status report by Sep 16 indicating progress achieved on those leads."" It posted further hearing on Sep 17.",Kolkata Police could not have sent the body for autopsy without filling mandatory details about the body and clothes to the doctor.

The couple argued that they should be allowed to appear before the ED office in Kolkata instead of the Delhi office, and the alleged offence was committed in Bengal.

Protests break out in 3 Manipur districts

GUWAHATI: Hundreds of enraged students clashed with police in Imphal Monday following the killing of a retired havildar and a woman the night before in a resurgence of violence that has claimed 11 lives since Sept 1.The unrest in the state escalated into large-scale protests, shifting the epicentre of violence to Manipur 's Raj Bhavan as students demanded action against those responsible and called for the resignation of top officials.Police fired tear gas shells, leading to several injuries. Protesters retaliated with stones, resulting in injuries to cops and security personnel.A security source confirmed that the body of ex-havildar Limkholal Mate, of Motbung in Kangpokpi district, was found in Sekmai, Imphal West. He was suspected to have been beaten to death. Nengjakhol Haokip (50) was killed by splinters in an arson attack in Thangbuh village, Kangpokpi, prompting CRPF personnel to retaliate.The retired havildar had entered Sekmai only Sunday night. Haokip's village, Thangbuh, was partially burned in an attack.In response to the deteriorating situation, Manipur govt ordered the closure of schools and colleges for Monday and Tuesday. However, students defied the shutdown, marching to Raj Bhavan, shouting slogans such as ""Long Live Manipur"" and ""resign all incompetent MLAs"", while demanding peace.Carrying a banner that read, "" Save Manipur for we are Indians, otherwise leave Manipur alone"", the protesters called for the resignations of the DGP and state's security adviser. They also demanded that the unified command's control be transferred from the Union home ministry to the CM and called for the immediate removal of Assam Rifles and other central forces from Manipur. The students also urged the 50 non-Kuki-Zo MLAs to take a stand or resign.Similar protests broke out in Thoubal district, and thousands of locals in Kakching district held a mass rally against recent civilian killings.The ongoing conflict has seen the deployment of weaponised drones and long-range crude rockets, adding to the chaos.Manipur police said cadres from militant groups, including those that signed ""suspension of operations"" agreements or peace deals with the Centre, were involved in the violence. They identified six bodies recovered after a gunbattle between warring groups in Jiribam district.The slain included Seiminlen Khongsai, Haogoulen Doungel, and Nehboithang Haokip, all members of Kuki Liberation Army (KLA), a group under Kuki National Organisation, which had signed a peace deal with govt in 2008. A member of United National Liberation Front's Pambei faction, Baspatimayum Lakhi Kumar Sharma, was also among the dead.Police identified the fifth body as that of village volunteer Lhunkhohao Haokip and the sixth as Yurembam Kulendra Singha (63), a civilian from Assam's Cachar district staying in Jiribam.","Police fired tear gas shells, leading to several injuries.

SC: Person in custody can seek pre-arrest bail in any other case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-booked-in-another-case-arrested-person-can-seek-anticipatory-bail-sc/articleshow/113205137.cms,"NEW DELHI: Settling a vexed issue that evoked different rulings from HCs, the Supreme Court on Monday adjudged that a person, already arrested and in custody in connection with an offence, is entitled to seek anticipatory bail if he feared that the police may arrest him in another offence.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud , and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said given the state of affairs on the ground, the police may book an accused , already in custody for an offence, in another case and arrest him immediately in that case if he is released on bail in the first case.""There is no express or implied restriction in the criminal procedure code or in any other statute that prohibits the Court of Session or the High Court from entertaining and deciding an anticipatory bail application in relation to an offence, while the applicant is in custody in relation to a different offence,"" the bench said. Writing the 74-page judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, ""When procedural law doesn't preclude the investigating agency from arresting a person in relation to a different offence while he is already under custody in some previous offence, the accused too cannot be precluded of his statutory right to apply for anticipatory bail only on the ground that he is in custody in relation to a different offence.""Once an accused, who is in custody, is granted anticipatory bail by the court in a subsequent offence, the police cannot seek his remand for interrogation in the second offence, the bench said.The High Courts of Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh (Allahabad) had taken a view that an anticipatory bail application would not be maintainable if the accused is already arrested and is in custody in connection with some other offence. However, Bombay and Orissa HCs had taken a contrary view. The pre-arrest bail provision was introduced in 1973 in the criminal procedure code.The bench said if an accused, already under custody for an offence, is granted pre-arrest bail in a different offence, then the police cannot take him in custody for production before the trial court in the second case.The SC said, ""Each arrest a person faces compounds his humiliation and ignominy... The initial arrest itself often brings a wave of social stigma and personal distress, as the individual struggles with the implications of their legal predicament. When a subsequent arrest occurs, it intensifies this emotional and social burden, amplifying the perception of their criminality and reinforcing negative judgments from society."" ""Subsequent arrest in relation to different offences, while the individual is in custody in a particular offence, further alienates the individual from their community and adversely affects their personal integrity. For this reason, it is incorrect to assume that subsequent arrests diminish the level of humiliation. On the contrary, each additional arrest exacerbates the person's shame making the cumulative impact of such legal entanglements increasingly devastating,"" it said.","A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said given the state of affairs on the ground, the police may book an accused in another case and arrest him immediately in that case if he is released on bail in the first case.

The accused are now in judicial custody.NIA, which started investigating Rameshwaram Cafe blast case on March 3, conducted several technical and field probes in coordination with various state police forces and other agencies.Investigations revealed that Shazib, along with Taaha, was absconding since 2020 after Al-Hind ISIS module was busted. Extensive searches by NIA had led to arrest of accused from their hideout in West Bengal 42 days after cafe explosion.Shazib and Taaha, both hailing from Shivamogga district of Karnataka, were indoctrinated and influenced by ISIS's violent ideology and had earlier conspired to perform 'hijra' (religious visit) to ISIS territories in Syria. They were actively involved in radicalising other Muslim youth with ISIS propaganda, including other two chargesheeted accused, Ahmed and Shareef. Shazib and Taaha had used fraudulently-obtained Indian SIM cards and had opened Indian bank accounts in fake names, using various Indian and Bangladeshi identity documents downloaded from the dark web.Investigations further found that Taaha had been introduced by an ex-convict, Shoaib Ahmed Mirza, to his future handler Mohammed Shaheed Faisal, who is also an absconder in LeT Bengaluru conspiracy case. Taaha then introduced Faisal to Mehaboob Pasha, an accused in Al-Hind ISIS module case, and Khaja Mohideen, amir of ISIS South India, and later to Maaz Muneer Ahmed. Shazib and Taaha were funded by their handler through crypto currencies , NIA said on Monday.The funds were purportedly used by accused to perpetrate various acts of violence in Bengaluru. These included a failed IED attack at the Karnataka BJP office on Jan 22, coinciding with the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony at Ram temple in Ayodhya, as per NIA chargesheet.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Monday inked the mega over Rs 26,000 crore contract with Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ) for the procurement of 240 aero-engines to power the Sukhoi-30MKI jets, which will sustain the operational capability of the 259 such Russian-origin fighters in the IAF combat fleet.The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be manufactured by the Koraput division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia .Under the contract, signed in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari and defence secretary Giridhar Aramane , HAL ""would enhance the indigenisation content of the aero-engines to 63% by the end of the delivery timeframe to achieve an average of over 54%"", a MoD official said.""This would also help increase the indigenous content of repair and overhaul tasks of the aero-engines. Around 30 aero-engines will be supplied per annum, with the delivery of all 240 to be completed over the next eight years,"" he added. The PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the deal on Sept 2, which is crucial considering that the IAF is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan , as was earlier reported by TOI.The 259 twin-engine Sukhois, the bulk of them produced by HAL under licence from Russia for over $12 billion, are the backbone of the IAF's combat fleet. Another 12 new Sukhois along with associated equipment are now being ordered for around Rs 11,500 crore to replace the ones that crashed over the years.The CCS in Feb has also cleared new engines for the around 60 MiG-29 fighters in the IAF fleet for Rs 5,300 crore, which too will be manufactured by HAL with Russian collaboration. India's failure to indigenously produce aero-engines for fighters, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has been a major problem over the years. The IAF is now ordering aero-engines in bulk, instead of the earlier piecemeal orders, to bring down the costs and enhance the indigenous content. Engines need to be replaced at least two to three times during a fighter's operational life.","The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be manufactured by the Koraput division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia.

"3 attempts to derail trains, 2 instances of stone pelting in past one week: Railways",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-attempts-to-derail-trains-2-instances-of-stone-pelting-in-past-one-week-railways/articleshow/113202653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three attempts to derail trains and two instances of pelting of stones in the past one week point to criminal intent of miscreants, railway ministry officials said highlighting how this “wave” of incidents has become a major cause of concern.They added that the collision of a train on Sunday evening with a cooking cylinder kept on the tracks in Kanpur did not result in any major mishap as the loco pilot applied emergency brakes in time.Officials said the police discovered petrol and matches at the scene, indicating criminal intention. Recently, Pakistan-based terrorist Farhatullah Ghori had released a video on Telegram exhorting his followers to orchestrate large-scale train derailments and urged them to “target the supply chain to cripple their infrastructure”.Since June last year, there have been at least 17 instances when either locomotive pilots or railway staff have detected pieces of wood between crossing rail, stones on rail line, signal tampering, and gas cylinders placed on tracks that are potential hazards. There have also been other instances of unauthorised use of tracks by social media influencers.While the Railway Protection Force (RPF) have filed cases, carried out investigation and have also apprehended some of the miscreants, sources said there is increased focus on checking tracks passing through identified sensitive areas. “It’s a tough task, but every effort is being made to avoid any mishap,” said a railway official. In some cases, juveniles have been apprehended.Sharing details of the recent incidents, sources said on September 5, a potentially catastrophic accident was avoided narrowly near Kurduwadi railway station in Solapur when a fouling mark slab was deliberately placed on the tracks near a signal point. “The alert loco pilot could stop the train in time and this is being investigated,” said an official.Similarly, on Aug 23, the Sabarmati-Jodhpur Vande Bharat hit a stone placed on the track, though it did not cause any mishap. Three days before that incident, a goods train collided with a motorcycle rim on the Dedicated Freight Corridor. Even an alloy wheel and a plastic bag were found in the bushes along the track. On August 18, half a dozen iron rods placed on a railway track collided with the engine of a passenger train in Jabalpur. “The local police have seized the iron rods and initiated investigation,” a railway official said.He added that besides placing foreign objects on tracks, there have been several instances of stone pelting on trains, particularly on Vande Bharat Express trains.",Three attempts to derail trains and two instances of pelting of stones in the past one week point to criminal intent of miscreants.
