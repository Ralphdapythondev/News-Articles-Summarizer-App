India’s ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ sees 60% faster clearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-fast-track-immigration-trusted-traveller-programme-sees-60-faster-clearance/articleshow/113475377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ (FTI-TTP) launched by the Union home minister Amit Shah in June to facilitate pre-verified flyers resulted in 60% faster immigration clearance for the 1,500 Indians and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) who availed of the facility, a senior home ministry official said while sharing that 18,400 individuals had enrolled in the programme so far.Briefing reporters about initiatives taken by the ministry of home affairs in the first 100 days of Narendra Modi government, a senior officer said that between the rollout of the three new criminal laws on July 1 and September 3, 5.56 lakh first information reports (FIRs) were registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. As many as 8 lakh officers were trained in the new laws by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, NCRB, National Forensic Sciences University, National Informatics Centre and the states/Union territories. In addition, ‘NCRB’s sankalan of criminal laws’, a mobile and web application to help users navigate the new laws, was downloaded 5.85 lakh times.The official said the emergency response support system (ERSS) — accessible to citizens through ‘112’ helpline — has been updated to ERSS 2.0, which is now fully functional in 6 states and Union territories. “Over 38.3 crore calls had been received by emergency response centres between the launch of 112 services across India, and July 31, 2023, and ‘112 India’ mobile app downloaded over 25 lakh times,” shared the officer.The official said that with a March 2026 deadline set for ending Left-wing extremism (LWE), the security vacuum was being filled with intelligence-based operations, along with expediting investigation and prosecution of cases relating to LWE violence. He said the Chhattisgarh government will soon bring a new surrender policy that will offer attractive incentives to youths to give up arms and join the mainstream.On the trusted traveller programme — launched via a pilot project at Delhi’s IGI to allow enrolled flyers to complete immigration by passing through e-gates or automated border gates, after screening based on facial recognition — the officer said it will now be extended to other international airports in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad. As of now the programme covers only Indian nationals and overseas citizens of India, who can sign up on a gratis basis, but shall eventually be extended to foreign nationals.Asked about concerns regarding data leaks, given that FTI-TTP uses facial recognition, the officer said adequate safeguards were built in to guard privacy and secure the database.“Due to the heavy passenger volume at key international airports, particularly when multiple flights land over a short time, congestion and long queues are witnessed. The FTI-TTP expedites immigration clearance without compromising security. The programme not only benefits those enrolled under the scheme but also others as the overall wait time at immigration counters decreases,” said the officer.On the fight against cybercrime, the official said 5,000 cyber commandos are to be trained over a 5-year period to assist the Central agencies and state/UT police in securing digital space.Talking about the launch of Mental Health and Normalcy Augmentation System (MANAS) helpline, the officer said the anti-narcotics task forces of state police will soon be integrated with it. He said the helpline has so far offered 12,985 citizens assistance in drug-related matters, deaddiction guidance and rehabilitation information.","The ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ (FTI-TTP) launched by the Union home minister Amit Shah in June resulted in 60% faster immigration clearance for the 1,500 Indians and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) who availed of the facility.

Helping beggars talk business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/helping-beggars-talk-business/articleshow/113474223.cms,"Wishes may or may not be horses, but what’s stopping beggars from becoming entrepreneurs ? They may not have money to make ends meet, but why can’t they seek investment instead of alms? These are the sort of seemingly impossible questions that Chandra Mishra has answered convincingly with Beggars Corporation . The backdrop to this story is provided by UP’s Varanasi.Chandra, 60, belongs to Odisha and is a former journalist who has also worked with various state govts on employment policies.His first brainwave came in mid-2020, when he was in Varanasi to conduct a survey on job losses due to the Covid pandemic. By the end of the year, he was back in the holy city with a long-term plan.Swarmed by kids pleading for a handout on Varanasi’s many ghats, Chandra and two of his friends decided they’d start a school for them. It eventually evolved into the ‘ School of Life ’ for children of beggars. Alongside, the trio came up with the idea of Beggars Corporation.Chandra partnered with a local NGO to provide job opportunities to beggars in Varanasi. There were no takers in the beginning, but the dwindling footfall of pilgrims during the lockdown meant begging was hardly viable for put ting food on the plate. Many beggars began to approach Chandra. Rajni was one of them. He started training her to make bags.Rajni was a quick learner and soon shot to fame. “There was no looking back for Rajni once her labour bore fruit. The change had set in. A beggar had been transformed into a worker,” said Chandra. Rajni brought in 12 others and Chandra and his partners Badrinath Mishra and Devendra Thapa registered Beggars Corporation as a for-profit company in Aug 2022.Soon, their first product line, called ‘ Bagful of Dreams ’, was launched. Before long, they diversified into another range called the ‘Enchanted Shirt’, featuring patchwork clothing made from upcycled Banarasi silk and cotton waste. Stoles, curtains, wall-hangings, cushion sets and even sheets followed on demand. Starting with an investment of Rs 5.7 lakh sourced from various people in the first year, the endeavour grew gradually. “These beggars have returned whatever amount was invested in them,” Chandra says. In the corporation’s lingo, they are known as beggar-turned-entrepreneurs (BTE ).Scaling up in 2023-24, the organisation reached out to over 50 beggar families. By 2024, over 2,000 people from different walks of life got associated with the corporation and its annual turnover reached Rs 3.4 crore. It’s looking to do business of Rs 15 crore in 2024-25.In April 2023, Beggars Corporation received the Best Social Impact Award in a contest held in collaboration with Startup India.","Chandra Mishra, 60, is the founder of Beggars Corporation in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.

Yacht Club of Hyderabad

has trained about 900 students who have bagged national and international laurels. It also funds the students’ education, nutrition and healthcare expenses

How about tonight?” asked an official from Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority when Suheim Sheikh approached them for access to the Hussain Sagar lake in Hyderabad for setting up a yacht club.When the officer asked Sheikh, now 60, when he needed permission, the former techie jokingly replied, “How about tomorrow?” Without even looking up from the file, the officer shot back, “How about tonight?”. And just like that Sheikh’s dream yacht club became a reality.That was way back in 2009. But if the term yacht club has triggered an image of an elite haunt, with men in dapper suits and women in designer gowns lazing on the deck of fancy boats, think again. Sheikh’s sailors are children whose parents earn less than Rs 20,000 a month, he says. Started with the motive of bringing ‘dignity through sports’, Sheikh has been working for the development of underprivileged children since, by teaching them sailing and supporting their education.His students have done him proud, bringing home 17 international and 157 national medals over the years. Many of the IIT graduate’s mentees have gone on to win medals within six months or a year of joining the club.“Sailing has always been for elitists. I wanted to bring it within the reach of poor children,” says Sheikh. Talking about how he came up with the idea of the yacht club, Sheikh, himself a sailor, says he noticed there was little representation from the city at sailing tournaments. “I have been sailing for 45 years now. When I used to take part in tournaments in the past, I would notice that hardly anyone from Hyderabad or even Telangana (then part of the undivided Andhra Pradesh) was competing,” says Sheikh, who learnt sailing at the Secunderabad Club in the city and participated in national and international tournaments, winning bronze and silver medals in laser standard sailing at the national level. “For 25 years or more, there was no child under the age of 15 representing the state,” he says. “So, it was always in the back of my mind to change this as the sport has always been in the hands of the elite.”Since its inception, The Yacht Club of Hyderabad has trained about 900 children. Classes are free with Sheikh spending anywhere between Rs 1 and Rs 3 lakh per year per child on training, nutrition, healthcare, education, etc. While most of the financial needs of the club are met through Sheikh’s savings — he was in software before giving up that career to pursue his passion for sailing — his close friends also chip in whenever needed. Post 2018, he also got support from a few corporates. He is now planning to accept CSR funds so that more children can be taken under his wings.A 360-Degree TurnWith 75 yachts, the Yacht Club of Hyderabad currently boasts of “the largest fleet in the country”, and has opened a second branch in the city’s Durgam Cheruvu.During peak sailing season (from June to Sept), the students spend about four hours sailing every day and two hours work ing on their mental and physical fitness. The day starts at 6.30 am and winds up by 8.30 pm. Activities include swimming, rowing, and weight training, while a thirdparty counsellor conducts weekly sessions to work on their mental fitness. During the off-season, children attend fitness training in the morning and sail after school.Along with free sailing lessons and educational support, the children also receive free meals, healthcare, counselling, and leadership and management training.“Expenditure per student depends on the level at which he or she is competing. If they are competing at international tournaments, the club ends up spending about Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh on one child,” says Sheikh, adding that the club also supports the students’ education till graduation or beyond, in cases where they show interest and promising results.Children as young as eight or nine years are selected from govt schools and orphanages, or even picked up from the streets, through simple fitness tests — running, long jump, push-ups, and sit-ups, among others, and if they show the zeal to learn and excel in sailing. “Currently, we have about 75 students. We want to grow to 300,” says Sheikh, adding that they want to conduct a talent drive across the country to pick more students. “We also want to throw the club open to students from non-marginalised backgrounds,” he adds, who will have to pay for the lessons.Sheikh spends about six months a year actively training students and accompanying them to various national and international championships. The remaining part is dedicated to the development of the club.According to the his students, the club has taught them not just sailing, but how to be successful in life. “Back in 2017, when personnel from the club came to our school and asked who is interested in sailing, I raised my hand assuming I would get to go to a summer camp. But it changed my entire life. I have won about 20 medals, I am studying for a degree at a top college in the city and have just returned from London, where I went as a manager with the sailing team from the club,” says Dharani Laveti, 19, one of the students, adding that right from moving her from a govt school to a private one years back, to sponsoring her education now, the club has taken care of all her needs. Dharani is raised by her single mother, who works in the housekeeping department of a private hospital.Preethi Kongara, 20, another student, who has just returned from Bangkok where she was undergoing training to become a coach, says she wants to become like Sheikh and produce champions in sailing.“From being afraid of water to reaching the Asian Games, my life took a 360-degree turn because of my coach. Now, I’m aiming for a podium finish at the next Asian Games,” says Preethi, who too was raised by a single mother, a housekeeping staffer at a private company.","The Yacht Club of Hyderabad has trained about 900 children.

A fresh fight

Symbol of defiance

Ground realities

JULANA : Vinesh Phogat ’s kaafila is running three hours late. What should have been a 3 pm Sunday afternoon election rally at village Gatauli is taking place hurriedly at dusk. Fine specimens of buffaloes make their way back home in twos, unperturbed by the organised cacophony that has engulfed them — tractors and SUVs parked at odd angles, pamphlets hauled out and passed around, hundreds of bright orange laddoos in huge wicker baskets being carried in as a village’s offering to their guest.Everyone seems to be coming in everyone else’s way, but no one seems to mind.Elections in Haryana are a public affair and like most things in the state, mostly a male exercise. The women, heads covered, look on, bunched together from terrace tops or at the threshold of their homes.Despite the humidity and the wait, the elders’ pagris are still in place and there’s always a proud, stiff community hookah gurgling away close by. It adds to the sense of pride they are feeling on Vinesh being picked by the Congress to contest from Julana in the Haryana assembly elections, which by extension is a representation of village Bakhta Khera, her in laws’ home. The symbolism is significant. “Notice how she had her head covered with her dupatta here,” says Sewa Singh in Julana, a Jatmajority agricultural belt.“Ab bahu hai, toh naata toh hai, lekin vote ka agley mahineyhi dekhenge (she’s a daughter-in-law of the village, so there’s that connection, but we’ll think about voting next month),” says Sewa, 52, smiling enigmatically, referring to the October 5 polling day.“Arrey, abhi toh aayi hai chhori (she has finally come here),” is the common refrain here on Vinesh’s much-awaited arrival after her Paris Olympics saga. Ensuring her win is being seen as a moral duty for Julana. It is a matter of the pagri.“Woh Julana ki bahu hai, yahan sey chunav ladh rahi hai. (Charkhi) Dadri uska ghar hai, wahan sey bhi umeedwar bann sakti thi, lekin usney Julana chuna (she’s Julana’s daughter-in-law and chose to contest from here though she could’ve chosen Charkhi Dadri, which is her home),” says a Bakhta Khera local, one of the many accompanying Vinesh on the campaign trail.He has all the numbers at his fingertips, calling Gatauli a “6,000-vote village, 50% Jat, 50% others, all farmers”. He is confident the village will vote overwhelmingly for her. “She’ll also get the Pandit and Yadav vote,” he says.In Gatauli, someone starts a generator and bright yellow lights come on, focussing on the diminutive centre of everybody’s attention. The light bounces off Vinesh’s face as she addresses the gathering.Soon, it is dark. There are a handful of villages still to visit but Vinesh, wiping away the sweat with her dupatta, cannot resist a quip. “Godde hi toot gaye, bhai-saab (it’s like the knees have given way),” she says of her back-breaking new routine. Her earthy self-deprecation draws uproarious laughter, and she adds after a Vajpayee-like dramatic pause, “Lekin mujhe aana toh tha (but I had to come)…”In this, the second coming of Vinesh, she may well be talking of her new calling in life, or maybe a new round in her continuing fight. Because Vinesh is all about the fight — right from secretly defying patriarch Mahavir Phogat’s diktat and maintaining a Facebook account as a 17-yearold in her native Balali in 2012 to shaking the world’s sensibilities as a much-abused, vilified and isolated social outcast who stormed into the wrestling final at Paris just a month ago. Paris would have immediately become India’s greatest, most oddsdefying sporting achievement, our very own version of the ‘Rumble in the Jungle’, probably even bigger given what she had been fighting against — the might of the state. Of course, it didn’t happen that way. What happened was Jantar Mantar — broken godde, but unbroken spirit.Jantar Mantar defines the Vinesh fight. Maybe, somewhere she transcends her narrow definition of Olympic wrestler to a stubborn, unwavering warrior of women’s rights and safety. Indeed, Vinesh in a wrestler’s singlet is a very brief, almost fading image on the flexi boards and car windshields. It has now made way for the image of a dupatta-donning Jat girl, head bowed, seeking haq for her community.Remind her here of her promise to talk in Paris — “Final ke baad baat karenge, sir ji. Abhi weight pakadna hai (let’s talk after the final, have to sort my weight now)” — and she speaks her mind. “Maaf kar do bhaisaab, election chal raha hai, kushti nahin hai ki khatam ho gayi (forgive me, this is an election; not a wrestling match )…”Maybe the kushti is really over. It is a different battle now. She may remember Paris, she hasn’t forgotten Jantar Mantar. Looks like the people of Julana too haven’t.Many see a reflection of their own identities in that version of Vinesh, such as Madhubala, the fiery vice president of the Haryana Students’ Federation of India. The 22-year-old law student from Kurukshetra and other SFI karyakartas have been accompanying Vinesh on her campaign. “It is often difficult to meet her. But if we don’t stand with her now, then when?” she asks, adding that her team had regularly dropped in at the protest at Jantar Mantar and even taken out morchas in Kurukshetra during that time.Earlier last week, at the launch of her election office at the old bus stand in Julana, party workers had organised a havan to kickstart her election campaign. It was attended by thousands of farmers and supporters from all over Haryana. She would effortlessly blend into the crowd, head bent to seek their blessings, sit among them, exchange serious talk, crack a joke that would leave many seniors with wide missing-teeth guffaws. It was hard to tell who was seeking out whom. Was it the vote-seeking “opportunistic” former wrestler, as the haters claimed she was, or was it the local in this male-dominated agricultural belt?“This is a one-sided fight. It’ll be an anti-BJP, anti-Centre vote,” said Balbir, 75, from village Etala Kalan in Hisar district. He is accompanied by half-a-dozen senior farmers from the Bharatiya Kisan Union, their green badges sitting proudly on their spotless white kurtas.“Pehle humare kisanon ko maraa, phir humare pehalwanon ko, humari bachchiyon ko. Vinesh ki ladai hum sab ki ladai hai (first they attacked the farmers, then our wrestlers and daughters; Vinesh’s fight is our fight),” says Om Prakash, 75.But not all are happy. Congress may not have won here since 2005, but the party’s old guard was taken aback by the election ticket to Vinesh. Parminder Singh Dhull, a two-time former MLA with Indian National Lok Dal, was largely expected to get the ticket. His phone was switched off in the early days of Vinesh’s campaign.Others like Dharampal Kataria are more pragmatic. “Yes, it is often a setback when a new person is put on a seat that we have been working for, but if the party wants it that way, we will obey and guide her,” he says. The Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee secretary is the backbone of the campaign, the silent presence in an otherwise noisy trail. “Our target is to win by at least 50,000 votes,” he says.“Main toh sirf ek zariya hoon, sirf ek chehraa. Asli kaam toh aap ko karna hai (I’m just a face, the real job you’ll have to do),” Vinesh extols the residents of Jai Jaiwanti in everyday Urdu, but soon local rustic Haryanvi takes over. “Bahut pyar diya laadli ko. Yahan ki bahu hoon, lekin beti sey zyadaa pyaar diya hai (I’m a daughter-in-law here, but have got more love than a daughter),” she says.It resonates with the women, cutting across caste lines. “Humare liye toh ab Vinesh Phogat hi sab kuch hai (We are all rooting for Vinesh now),” 30-year-old Seema Devi has no doubt where her allegiance lies. “Dilli-waali sarkar ne hamari naukriyaan khaa li. Vinesh ney iss sarkar ke khilaaf morcha nikala (jobs have disappeared under the central govt. Vinesh sat in protest against this govt),” says the law graduate who belongs to the Prajapati (Kumhar) community.Not far, in a covered trailer, a group of women of varying ages wait for their driver. Hesitant to speak first, the oldest of them, 80-year-old Ramoorti Daadi declares, “Vinesh ko hi vote devengey (it’s Vinesh that we’ll vote for).”This sense of independent choicemaking is in contrast to a group of pilgrims headed for Khatu near Sikar in Rajasthan. “It’s not going to be that easy for Vinesh. There are four Jat candidates here and BJP is also strong,” says the leader of the group. Another pipes in, “The women will vote for whoever the family elders ask us to.”The women in the group are silent, but one chips in. “I’ll vote for whoever can get our sewers cleaned up.” It is an obtuse offer of defiance.At the intersection of Garhwali and Jai Jaiwanti villages, it is possible that Vinesh’s caravan met with that of Captain Yogesh Bairagi. A former serviceman, Bairagi is the BJP candidate, a late announcement that caught many in the region by surprise. Many local BJP supporters admit that it is a 50-50 battle, pointing out that Bairagi had done good work in neighbouring Safidoh, organising employment camps.When one of them hears that the correspondent is from the Capital, he discreetly inquires if there are any jobs available.","Vinesh Phogat is contesting from village Julana in Haryana assembly elections.

SC Troubled by CBI’s Report on RG Kar Doctor Rape-Murder: Evidence Tampering Suspected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/were-disturbed-by-findings-of-cbis-rg-kar-report-sc/articleshow/113439625.cms,"CBI line of probe indicates justice will be done: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In a setback to West Bengal government, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was ""very disturbed"" by the status report of the CBI probe finding serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.A bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud made this observation after the counsel for the original petitioner before Calcutta HC accused state police of employing a bizarre process for search and seizure, and alleged that the crime scene was deliberately left unguarded to let vandals destroy vital evidence.""What you are flagging is of the utmost concern. CBI itself is very concerned that this has happened,"" CJI told the counsel.""CBI is investigating... whether there was tampering with the scene of crime, whether evidence was destroyed and whether any other person (apart from those arrested) was involved,"" SC said.It will be unwise for us to reveal anything at this stage, which may enable suspects to destroy evidence.

Constitution amendments

NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Wednesday kicked off the exercise to implement its ' One Nation One Election ' promise by 2029, accepting the proposals of a high-level panel headed by former President Ramnath Kovind . The move will need support from opposition and non-NDA parties to push amendments to the Constitution, for which three ministers have been tasked to coordinate with political parties.The amendments may be introduced as early as the winter session of Parliament, sources said.Although home minister Amit Shah had Tuesday reaffirmed govt's intent to implement the move within the current term of Modi government, few had expected matters to move so swiftly, given NDA's lack of numbers in Parliament and the stated position of oppositon parties, who had among them enough strength to thwart the move.With the Union Cabinet clearing the proposal for 'One Nation, One Election' on Wednesday, PM Narendra Modi said synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies was an imperative which could not be dodged indefinitely.""This is an important step towards making our democracy even more vibrant and participative,"" Modi wrote on X while complimenting the Kovind committee.The plan envisages a two-stage transition - the first, involving simultaneous polls for Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will need an amendment to the Constitution, which will need to be ratified by both Houses of Parliament with two-thirds majority.To implement the second step - holding elections to local bodies within 100 days of general elections - a second Constitutional amendment will be required, which will need to be ratified by at least half the states.When the panel's recommendations were submitted, BJP enjoyed absolute majority in Lok Sabha, and could have reached the two-thirds threshold for a Constitutional amendment by deploying manoeuvres to find support from unlikely quarters.But with the arithmetic changed after the Lok Sabha polls, Modi will have to depend on allies and others to push the amendments in the Lower House.NDA allies are standing by the decision. More importantly, Samajwadi Party diverged from its ally Congress's outright rejection of the move to demand an all-party meeting to evolve consensus. BSP reversed its earlier opposition to support the idea, although this would be of no consequence given its lack of representation in the two Houses.During consultations with the Kovind panel, 32 political parties had supported the plan, with 15 opposing it, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, DMK, Trinamool and the Left.Govt remains hopeful of finding support. ""Govt will hold discussions across the country, and among different groups. Our govt believes in consensus. There will be more high-level deliberations,"" I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said after the Cabinet meeting, where the PM is learnt to have emphasised the need to spread awareness about the gains - savings for the exchequer, relief from the pauses in decision-making minimising election fatigue, improved governance and stability and consistency in policies, likely to follow from holding elections together.Three ministers - Rajnath Singh, Kiren Rijiju and Arjun Ram Meghwal - will consult with political parties to build support for the plan, sources said.Cabinet ministers were of the view that an extensive nationwide campaign will be launched to sensitise stakeholders about the need to hold simultaneous polls and also create pressure on the naysayers.But before moving the amendments, govt will constitute an implementation group that will further work on the proposal. Separately, Election Commission and state chief election officers will have to work on common electoral rolls.Once the amendments are undertaken, the President will notify the ""appointed date"" for holding simultaneous polls. The tenure of state assemblies will expire from the appointed date. This means that the tenure of several state assemblies will be curtailed.In the case of state assemblies getting dissolved on account of no-confidence motion or a hung House, fresh elections will be held along with Lok Sabha polls.As far back as 1999, the law commission, and subsequently a Parliamentary panel in 2015, had also supported simultaneous elections.","PM Narendra Modi said synchronising elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies was an imperative which could not be dodged indefinitely. Three ministers - Rajnath Singh, Kiren Rijiju and Arjun Ram Meghwal - will consult with political parties to build support for the plan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113469661,imgsize-510220,width-400,resizemode-4/113469661.jpg"

"Indus Water Treaty: India serves formal notice to Pakistan, seeks modification",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indus-water-treaty-india-serves-formal-notice-to-pakistan-seeks-modification/articleshow/113455222.cms,"What is Indus Water Treaty?

NEW DELHI: India has sent notice to Pakistan seeking changes in crucial Indus Water Treaty . According to news agency PTI sources, the Indian government served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the treaty.The notice highlighted fundamental changes in circumstances that require review of treaty.India had also sent a notice to Pakistan in January, 2023 seeking amendment to 1960 treaty.The notice was issued due to Pakistan's failure to cooperate in the implementation of the treaty.According to the Indus Waters Treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, ""all the water of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually — is allocated to India for unrestricted use."" On the other hand, the majority of the water from the western rivers, namely the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, which amounts to approximately 135 MAF annually, has been allocated to Pakistan.Also Read:The treaty grants India the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on the western rivers, subject to specific design and operation criteria. Pakistan has the right to raise objections to the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on these rivers. Under the treaty, Pakistan received roughly 80 per cent of the water in the Indus drainage system, while India was allocated about 3.3 crore out of the total 16.8 crore acre-feet of water in the Indus system. Currently, India utilises slightly more than 90 per cent of its allocated share of the Indus waters.India has the right to utilise water resources from the Indus River system in several states, including Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These states also receive water from the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganga. Pakistan, on the other hand, heavily relies on the Indus system, particularly in its Punjab province, which is crucial for feeding the rest of the country. Whenever India attempts to use its allocated water quota or construct a dam as permitted under the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan raises objections, leading to increased tensions between the two nations.One such example is the Tulbul Navigation Project, which the Indian government decided to expedite following the Uri terror attack. The project, referred to as the Wullar Barrage project by Pakistan, is a long-standing plan that was suspended in 1987 due to objections from Pakistan. According to sources, despite India's repeated efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution, Pakistan refused to discuss the issue during the five meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission held between 2017 and 2022. Recently, at Pakistan's persistent insistence, the World Bank has initiated actions on both the neutral expert and Court of Arbitration processes.Under the Indus Waters Treaty, India has the right to develop 13.4 lakh acres of irrigation in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. However, currently, only 6.42 lakh acres of land are irrigated in these Union Territories. Furthermore, the treaty allows India to store 3.60 million acre-feet of water from the western rivers, namely the Jhelum, Indus, and Chenab. To date, there is virtually no storage capacity developed in Jammu and Kashmir. The treaty also permits India to construct run-of-river dams on the Jhelum, Chenab, and Indus without blocking the flow of water. This provision gives India the advantage of temporarily restricting the flow of waters in the rivers allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.","India has served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the Indus Water Treaty.

Top-notch drone goes down after technical failure off Chennai just ahead of mega deal with the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-notch-drone-goes-down-after-technical-failure-off-chennai-just-ahead-of-mega-deal-with-the-us/articleshow/113467280.cms,"NEW DELHI: A top-notch MQ-9B Sea Guardian drone, an unarmed version leased by the Navy from US firm General Atomics , had to be ditched into the sea off Chennai after it encountered a technical failure on a routine surveillance mission in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) on Wednesday afternoon.The “controlled ditching” of the high-altitude, long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) comes just when India is getting set to ink the mega $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore) deal for 31 weaponized `hunter-killer’ variants of the drone with the US next month, as was earlier reported by TOI.The fighter-sized Sea Guardian operating from naval air base INS Rajali at Arakkonam, near Chennai, encountered the technical failure at about 2 pm. “There is a procedure to do a technical reset of the RPA in flight. It was tried but did not work. It was then navigated to a safe area over the sea and a controlled ditching was carried out,” an officer said.The Navy has sought a detailed report from General Atomics since the company was “operating and maintaining” the two leased Sea Guardians, which are variants of the famous Predator or Reaper drones. India had first got the two RPAs on lease from General Atomics in Sept 2020 and has since extended the lease several times.The two RPAs have flown over 12,000 hours of long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions in the IOR, with the Navy deciding their tasking and getting all the “feeds” from them. “The drones, along with other assets, have enabled the Navy to keep a close track of Chinese warships and spy vessels operating in the IOR,” another officer said.India has extensively deployed the drones forISR missions even along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China amid the ongoing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh. “The imagery provided by the drones about the activities of the People’s Liberation Army across the LAC convinced national security planners of their operational utility,” he added.The Predators or Reapers do have a proven track record in high-value precision bombings in Afghanistan and other conflicts, though some critics say the drones have largely operated in “uncontested air space” without facing a hostile air force or advanced surface-to-air missile systems.In the proposed govt-to-govt deal with the US, 15 Sea Guardians are earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, in the backdrop of both China and Pakistan steadily boosting their fleets of armed drones.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 MQ-9B drones will come with 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment.Under the deal, General Atomics will assemble the 31 drones in India, while also making an investment, sourcing almost 35% of the components from Indian companies and setting up an MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here.India also plans to equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO , in the future, as was reported by TOI.","A top-notch MQ-9B Sea Guardian drone had to be ditched into the sea off Chennai after it encountered a technical failure on a routine surveillance mission.

"Citing cross-border terrorism, India seeks Indus treaty review",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citing-cross-border-terrorism-india-seeks-indus-treaty-review/articleshow/113467080.cms,"India has served a notice to Pakistan for a review and modification of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), calling upon Islamabad to begin negotiations with the Indian government for the same. While India had issued a similar notice for IWT modification last year too, it has cited on this occasion the impact of what official sources called persistent cross-border terrorism as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the World Bank-backed Treaty that has remained invulnerable so far to major and frequent disruptions in bilateral ties.The fresh notice follows the recent terror attacks in Jammu, after which PM Narendra Modi had accused Pakistan of using terrorism and “proxy war” to remain relevant. However, the trigger for first seeking a modification last year was Pakistan’s “intransigence and unilateral actions” on the issue of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in J&K. India has been upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way to look into Pakistan's objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue.According to official sources, India’s notification highlights “fundamental and unforeseen changes in circumstances” that require a reassessment of obligations under various Articles of the Treaty. “Among various concerns, important ones include change in population demographics; environmental issues; need to accelerate development of clean energy to meet India’s emission targets and impact of persistent cross border terrorism,” said a source on condition of anonymity.The IWT provides a framework for irrigation and hydropower development, allocating western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India.As the World Bank says, the Treaty also allows each country certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other.The notice was served to Pakistan on August 30 in line with Article XII(3) of the IWT. Under the Article, according to Indian authorities, the Treaty provisions can be modified by a duly ratified agreement between the 2 governments. The notification disclosure coincided with the first round of voting in the J&K assembly elections.Government sources also said the notification was issued against the backdrop of the prolonged dispute over the Kishenganga and Ratle Hydro Projects. The World Bank in October 2022 appointed not just a neutral expert that India sought to examine the issue but also, at Pakistan's insistence, a Court of Arbitration chairman, despite acknowledging India's concern that carrying out the two processes concurrently posed practical and legal challenges. The Indian side has, therefore, also called for reconsideration of dispute resolution mechanism under the Treaty, said a source. India has not joined the Court of Arbitration meetings, as it believes it was constituted illegally.India had in June this year hosted a delegation from Pakistan on water-related bilateral issues under the IWT, which requires the two sides to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. Indus talks backed by the World Bank have not been affected by the turbulent India-Pakistan relations that have otherwise not seen any substantive bilateral engagement between them in the past 9 years, or since the Pathankot terror attack. Pakistan has invited India to the SCO heads of government meeting it will host next month, raising hopes of a high-level visit from India but the Indian government, which is unlikely to skip the meeting because it’s a multilateral event, is yet to take a call on the level of participation.","India has served a notice to Pakistan for a review and modification of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) The fresh notice follows the recent terror attacks in Jammu, after which PM Narendra Modi had accused Pakistan of using terrorism and “proxy war” to remain relevant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113467107,imgsize-36974,width-400,resizemode-4/113467107.jpg"
"With bail stirring suspicion, all eyes on Engineer's impact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-bail-stirring-suspicion-all-eyes-on-engineers-impact/articleshow/113471530.cms,"SRINAGAR/ANANTNAG: This election, Kashmir is an alphabet soup, and adding to the traditional PDP/NC binary are AIP, AP, JEI, DPAP. The ubiquitous chatter in the middle of this muddle is the conspiracy theory about the ""invisible hand of Delhi"". And at the centre of these intrigues sits Engineer Rashid of Awami Ittehad Party .Jailed for over five years from where he won the 2024 Lok Sabha election but bailed out just in the nick of time to campaign for assembly polls , Rashid is a maverick who has roiled Kashmir politics like few have in the past.To his backers, he is the man who did not bend to Modi's will, but to others that includes the Abdullahs and the Muftis, he is the proxy sent by BJP to damage the Kashmiri regional parties and scramble the board. Kashmir is wracking its brain over who is Engineer and what he will manage. His damage potential will be a key story of the Kashmir outcome on October 8.Amid the hullabaloo, the scrawny visage that hides a shrill tone and sharp tongue shoots a mischievous half grin and fires back at TOI, ""I was put in Tihar on August 9, 2019, after the revocation of statehood, and remained there till September 11, 2024. But they (Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq, Sajjad Lone) were treated as VVIP guests in five-star hotels. It is strange they are accusing me of being the Centre's pawn.""That is the rebuttal Rashid recites ad nauseum, his calling card positioning himself as the untainted one. But Kashmir is agog with why Rashid, not bailed for fighting the LS polls and to later attend Parliament, was suddenly ""let loose"" to campaign. The theory is that Engineer, with his native appeal on sensitive issues that target PM Modi, will wean away voters from NC-Congress and PDP who are vowing arm's length from BJP, and create a more friendly post-poll tally for BJP. The threat has alarmed the mainstream.Engineer laughs at this. ""I defeated Omar from jail in Baramulla LS polls by over two lakh votes, and Mehbooba lost heavily in Anantnag. And they are calling me vote-cutters. It is a unique case.""Yet, a veteran observer of local politics, not wishing to be named, gave an alternative view: Jail generated sympathy for Engineer in the LS polls and bail has generated suspicions in the assembly contest. ""He may not do as much harm as is being speculated,"" he estimates.Engineer claimed the propaganda by Omar and Mehbooba will only benefit him. ""Yeh jo public hai, sab jaanti hai (People know everything). I am in jail for 5.5 years and traitors, puppets, rubber stamps of New Delhi are accusing me. People know it.""Besides the bail, there are questions about the well-funded campaign of AIP's 34 candidates, its sudden alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami that surprised all by, out of the blue, deciding to contest the polls backing and fielding Independents. Kashmir is particularly prone to doubts about "" Delhi's hand "" because PDP defector Altaf Bukhari's Apni Party and later Ghulam Nabi Azad's DPAP could never shrug off the tag of being BJP's proxies. With the two seen as having failed to realise their ""potential"", Engineer's election-eve bail helped the mainstream players to stoke the fire that AIP is BJP's final play.But the AIP chief is clear in his mind. ""I don't want to belittle myself by responding to their accusations,"" he said.",Engineer Rashid is a maverick who has roiled Kashmir politics like few have in the past.

How will these proposals be implemented?

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led NDA government on Wednesday took another step towards 'one nation, one election' as the Union Cabinet approved the Kovind panel recommendations for simultaneous elections in the country. The panel, headed by former president Ram Nath Kovind , had submitted its report in March this year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the development calling it an important step towards making India's democracy even more vibrant and participative even as the opposition slammed his government calling the idea impractical and also a cheap stunt.The Kovind panel proposes synchronising elections in two steps. While the first step will integrate Lok Sabha elections and state assemblies' polls, the second step will ensure that elections to municipalities and panchayats are held within 100 days of polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies.In the past, there have been several occasions when a sizeable number of states have held assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha election. This number was highest in 1967, when as many as 20 state elections were held along with the national elections for Lower House. In 1977, this number was 17 while in 1980 and 1985, it was 14. However, since 1989 the number of states that have held elections simultaneously with Lok Sabha has been in single digits.One of the biggest challenges in implementing 'one nation, one election' is the differing tenures of various state assemblies. Here's a look at how assembly election in states are scheduled from 2024 to 2029, assuming that next Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2029 and all the state governments complete their respective terms.2024: Lok Sabha elections + 6 states, 1 UT2025: 2 states, 1 UT2026: 4 states, 1 UT2027: 6 states2028: 10 statesThe Kovind panel proposes a one-time transitory measure to synchronise all these polls.The transition provisions would come into force from the ""Appointed Date"", which will be the date of the first sitting of Lok Sabha constituted after a general election. The President would by notification issued on ""Appointed Date"" bring into force the provisions for transition.Once the transition provisions are brought into play, the tenure of all state legislative assemblies constituted in any election after the “Appointed date” would come to an end on the expiry of the full term of Lok Sabha, irrespective of when that assembly was constituted. This would result in Lok Sabha and all state legislative assemblies being ready for a simultaneous election at the end of this term.Once synchronisation between the terms of Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies is achieved, a slew of measures have been proposed by the Kovind Panel to ensure that there is no future disruptions in holding of simultaneous polls. The panel proposes amendments in Constitution to introduce some new concepts and terminologies to ensure synchronisation in future elections.If the Lower House or any state assembly is dissolved sooner than its period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting, a mid-term election would be held for reconstituting the House or assembly as the case may be. However, the term of the House or the assembly so constituted through a mid-term election, would be for the remaining unexpired period of its term.This will ensure that at the end of five years, the Lok Sabha and all the state assemblies would reach the end of their tenure at the same time, and be ready for the next general election together.In case of any unforseen situation due to which the simultaneous elections to any state assembly cannot be conducted at the time of general elections, the Election Commission of India may make a recommendation to the President, to declare by an Order that the election to that Legislative Assembly may be conducted at a later date. However, the term of such assembly, so constituted, shall end on the same date as the end of the full term of the Lok Sabha.If Lok Sabha is dissolved sooner than the expiry of its full term, fresh elections will be conducted and the next House of the People thus constituted, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for a period which is equal to the unexpired term of the immediately preceding Lok Sabha.If any legislative assembly is dissolved sooner than the expiry of its full term, fresh elections will be held and a new assembly will be constituted. This new assembly, unless sooner dissolved, shall come to an end with the expiry of full term of Lok Sabha.Mid-term elections to Municipalities and Panchayats will be held for the unexpired period of their term until the next general elections.The Kovind panel has proposed a Constitution Amendment Bill in Parliament to amend Article 83 (Duration of Houses of Parliament) and Article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures) of the Constitution. This Constitution Amendment will not need ratification by the States.Another Constitution Amendment Bill will be introduced for insertion of Article 324A for elections to Municipalities and Panchayats, passed with ratification by the states.Similar amendments will be required to be made in Section 5 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 for the Legislative Assembly of Delhi and Section 5 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 for the Legislative Assembly of Puducherry. Furthermore, similar amendment will also be required in Section 17 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.",Kovind panel proposes synchronising elections in two steps. First step will integrate Lok Sabha elections and state assemblies' polls. Second step will ensure that elections to municipalities and panchayats are held within 100 days of polls to Lok Sabha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113463802,imgsize-45272,width-400,resizemode-4/113463802.jpg"

The initiative includes setting up and strengthening of one lakh new/ existing district cooperative societies, multi-purpose district cooperative societies, and M-PACS.""Providing enabling infrastructure e.g. AMCU (Automatic Milk Collection Unit), DPMCU (Data Processing Milk Collection Units), testing equipment, Bulk Milk Coolers, etc., will be the key component of the initiative ,"" said the official.Initially, this initiative will be funded by National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) from their own resources by providing assistance of Rs 40,000 per M-PACS to 1,000 M-PACS and subsequently from the proposed National Programme for Dairy Development 2.0 scheme of department of animal husbandry and dairying (DAHD).""This will strengthen the entire milk value chain.

72 in top 100 & all in top 10 AIR pick IIT Bombay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/72-in-top-100-all-in-top-10-air-pick-iit-bombay/articleshow/113470128.cms,"IIT-B and computer science emerge as JEE toppers' picks

Of 17,695 new students, 20% are girls

Seventy-two of top 100 JEE (A) rankers have chosen IIT Bombay , with Delhi following with 23. And in a perfect 10 for the Powai campus, all top 10 rankers have decided to study computer science at the institution. Data shared by IIT Madras at the close of admissions for the 2024-28 batch shows of the top 500, 179 chose IIT-B, 109 Delhi and 69 Madras. While 16 of the top 500 girls arrived in Mumbai, IIT Kharagpur did not get a single top-100 student, reported.MUMBAI: Newcomers to the elite technological club of the country seem to have made a clear choice: 72 of the top 100 JEE (Advanced) rankers have selected the IIT Bombay campus. Another 23 chose IIT Delhi, and two picked IIT Madras.The clamour for computer science at IIT-B among the cream of the lot went up a notch to touch a perfect 10 - all the top 10 all-India rankers in JEE are joining the Powai campus. Twenty-four of the first 25 and 47 of the top 50 followed suit and picked the college over other technology schools at the close of admissions for the 2024-28 batch.Each year, the demand for quality engineering education throws up a disproportionate number of applicants at the computer science department of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. A look at the admission forms filled by those who qualified in the JEE (Advanced) 2024 shows that one of two put down computer science at IIT-B as one of their top choices.Data shared by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras shows that of the top 500, 179 chose IIT-B, followed by 109 choosing IIT Delhi, and 69 picking IIT Madras.Last year, 67 of the top 100 got a seat in IIT-B, though computer science at IIT-B was the first choice of 93 of the top 100 rankers. Classes for freshmen have started at the IITs. ""I am proud that IIT Bombay remains the preferred destination for most of the top rankers in the JEE (Advanced) examination,"" IITB director Prof Shireesh Kedare said.On each IIT campus, the top 100 students are considered the icing on the creamy layer. About 30 years ago, IIT Kharagpur was the engineering mecca. The oldest IIT of the country, however, did not receive a single student from the top 100 this year.""While Bombay and Delhi were still building themselves, Kharagpur's students had already occupied top positions in big companies. Students looked at Kharagpur's illustrious alumni and rushed there. Now this has changed,"" a former JEE chairman said.Kanpur ruled the charts after that. A decade ago, admission to IIT-Kanpur ensured demi-god treatment.It is no longer the case. IIT-B alumnus Vishal Misra, vice dean of computing and AI at Columbia Engineering, was recently at the Columbia Global Center Mumbai. Asked why IIT-B is the top choice for many, he said: ""It's the best. As an alum, I have to say that it's the best, for multiple reasons. I think being in Mumbai helps a lot too.""The old Indian Institutes of Technology in the city, Delhi, Chennai and Kanpur have the best gender ratio among all the IIT campuses. This year, 3,480 girls joined various IITs, with 15 girls getting in through the gender-neutral pool of seats, reported.Of the 17,695 students admitted to the 23 IITs, women make up 19.75%. Last year, of the 17,340 admits given out by the IITs, 3,359 were handed out to girls. This year, 42,947 women candidates registered for JEE (Advanced) 2024. Of them, 7,964 candidates made the cut. The southern zone has a disproportionately large share of women. Their journey begins early. Not only have as many bagged a seat, but the proportion of girls - about 15,000 - who register from the southern zone is almost a third of all women aspirants. This zone comprises Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. Close to 2,600 from this zone qualified after the entrance exams to join the IITs.Six years after the supernumerary women's quota was intro- duced in the IITs, almost every campus has an average of 19.7% girls. IIT Delhi aims to move towards a 50:50 gender ratio on its campus. ""Women are performing well in all fields of STEM at IIT Delhi. As we are moving towards becoming multi-disciplinary and opening more programmes like design, public policy, we are seeing that a good diverse mix adds so much to the richness of the educational experience,"" IIT Delhi director Rangan Banerjee said. ""While there is already an ecosystem to make everyone comfortable, we want to change the mindset towards science and engineering in a way that our campus' gender ratio is reflec- tive of India's population numbers. We are also making efforts to encourage more women in schools to take up STEM subjects... The ultimate goal is that gender becomes a non-issue,"" he said.","Seventy-two of top 100 JEE (A) rankers have chosen IIT Bombay, with Delhi following with 23.

They also sought resettlement that ensures continuity for the younger generation with their roots through this initiative.The community members termed the government's proposal to provide jobs and official quarters in Kashmir to 5,000 Kashmiri migrant youths, including Muslims and Sikhs, as merely symbolic.They argue that this gesture undermines the return and rehabilitation needs of the 300,000-strong community.There was little effect of a poll boycott call given by Panun Kashmir and other organisations who were pressing for the enactment of a law to ensure legal recognition of alleged atrocities against the community.""The only demand we have consistently voted for over the years is our collective right to a homeland in Kashmir. It is disheartening that this demand has continuously fallen on deaf ears,"" said 70-year-old Avtar Krishen said.Krishen, a retired teacher, voted in the Kulgam assembly segment at a polling station in Jagti.He lamented that government policies on ""return and rehabilitation"" announced over two decades ago have never been effectively implemented. Instead, they have served as mere symbols of intent, he added.""Subsequent governments, including Congress and subsequently BJP, have treated the rehabilitation of just 6,000 out of our 300,000 population with government jobs and official housing until retirement. Is this truly rehabilitation?"" he questioned.The community which was forced to flee from the Valley in the early 90s under fear of militancy demanded their permanent return and rehabilitation with guarantee of peace and security.Kashmiri Pandits (KPs) lined up in long queues amid tight security to cast their votes in 16 assembly constituencies of Kashmir in the first phase of elections.Similarly, 67-year-old Poshkar Nath, who voted in the Shangus-Anantnag constituency where three Kashmiri Pandits are contesting elections, voiced concerns over political commitments to the return and rehabilitation of KPs in the valley.However, the younger generation of KPs emphasises the need for job opportunities in both government and private sectors in the valley for a sustainable return and rehabilitation.""We believe that any return and rehabilitation plan must ensure employment opportunities alongside settlement to prevent the large-scale migration of our youth abroad. This is a critical concern for preserving our 5,000-year-old civilisation,"" said Vaibhav, a young voter studying medicine.Young voters from the community advocate for innovative solutions to address this humanitarian issue and call for a united effort by all parties to save their ancient civilization in the Valley.Most voters expressed optimism about participating in assembly elections after a decade, unaffected by the poll boycott calls. pti",Displaced Kashmiri Pandits voted with a collective demand to establish a 'homeland' in the Valley.

59% turnout in first phase of J&K assembly polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/59-turnout-in-first-phase-of-jk-assembly-polls/articleshow/113468798.cms,"Peaceful polling amid high security

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: The first phase of the three-part J&K assembly elections recorded a voter turnout of 59% across 24 constituencies Wednesday, covering seven districts in south Kashmir and Jammu division on either side of the Pir Panjal range.The voting process proceeded peacefully amid high security, according to J&K’s chief electoral officer PK Pole, and the final turnout could slightly increase once data from remote areas and postal ballots are included.“Today’s voting percentage is higher than previous elections held in 2009, 2014, and 2024 (Lok Sabha), and 2008 and 2014 (assembly),” Pole said, expressing satisfaction with the voter engagement in 16 constituencies of south Kashmir districts, traditionally known for low turnout. “I am sure that in the next two phases, the voting percentage will be much higher than today,” he said in Jammu city.However, the turnout was lower than the 71% recorded in the first of the five phases of elections held a decade ago. In 2014, the total turnout was nearly 66%, but the assembly’s strength was 87 then, including four seats from Ladakh. This was the highest polling percentage in 25 years despite calls by Hurriyat leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to boycott the elections.The 2024 assembly elections are the first in 10 years and since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 and the bifurcation of the region into Union territories — J&K and Ladakh. Following the 2023 delimitation exercise, the assembly now has 90 seats, with 47 representatives from Kashmir and 43 from Jammu.The delimitation exercise ensured that no constituency straddles two districts, allowing for clearer district-wise figures this time, Pole said. Voter turnout varied across districts. In south Kashmir, Kulgam district recorded 61%, while Pulwama had the lowest with 46%. In the Jammu division, districts like Kishtwar saw 77%, the highest recorded in the region. Inderwal assembly segment in Jammu recorded an impressive 80% turnout.In Redwani village of Kulgam’s Devsar constituency, which had previously been a hotbed for separatist activities, voters lined up in large numbers. Mahak Irfan, a 22-year-old first-time voter, said: “Boycott has given us nothing. We need someone to change the current dynamics and protect our rights.”Local concerns, such as access to electricity and water resources, were central to voter sentiment. Abdul Rahim Dar of Devsar said: “Despite having our own power resources, we have to purchase electricity from outside. Now they’re saying that water will also be prepaid.”Kulgam constituency saw CPM leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami contesting for a fifth consecutive term. He is facing stiff competition from nine other candidates, including independent candidate Talat Majid Alie — a former member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami.Tarigami’s supporters, such as Manzoor Ahmad, highlighted his achievements: “This vote is for his bold stand against the abrogation of Article 370. Tarigami always raised his voice against the revocation of the special status of Kashmir.”In Dooru, AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir of the NC-Congress alliance is also facing a tough challenge with the entry of former separatists as independents. Mir, who had won the seat in 2002 and 2008, narrowly lost by 161 votes in 2014 to PDP’s Syed Farooq Ahmad Andrabi. Similar tight margins were seen in Gurez and Kupwara, where candidates won by razor-thin differences — 141 and 151 votes, respectively.The Jammu region’s eight constituencies saw strong voter enthusiasm, with long queues at polling stations in Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban districts, which have been reeling from terrorist violence this summer.Former J&K Congress chief Vikar Rasool Wani expressed confidence in his party’s chances despite a “friendly fight” with ally NC in Banihal. “We will win. Mark my words,” he said after casting his vote at Tulbagh-Rallu polling station. “It is not a friendly contest as they (NC) have criticised and abused us continuously.”BJP’s Shagun Parihar, whose father and uncle were killed by terrorists in 2018, also expressed confidence after casting her vote in Kishtwar’s Mohalla Bagwan polling booth. “BJP will form the next govt in J&K,” said the 29-year-old, who is facing NC’s Sajjad Ahmed Kitchloo and PDP’s Firdous Ahmed Tak.However, polling was briefly halted in the booth following complaints of “bogus” voting, where Shagun was allegedly heckled by PDP and NC workers. “I was taunted by NC-PDP workers that I am playing the victim card and trying to gain sympathy.” PDP’s Tak later claimed he was assaulted by a police officer and accused Shagun of trying to disrupt the peaceful voting process.For Kashmiri Pandits, special polling stations were set up in Jammu, Udhampur, and Delhi to facilitate voting for over 35,000 displaced voters. “Free transport from designated locations was provided to them,” an official said.Voting for 26 seats will be held in the second phase on Sept 25, followed by 40 seats in the final round on Oct 1. Votes will be counted on Oct 8.",The first phase of the three-part J&K assembly elections recorded a voter turnout of 59% across 24 constituencies.

It has come. We are witnessing it. Yogi Arvind had declared it. The attitude of the whole world is also changing in this direction, we know this as well,"" the RSS chief said.The publication of Hindi commentary of vedas written by Shripad Damodar Satvalekar is also an indication to this, he added.Bhagwat said the knowledge of religion comes from the vedas because the foundation of these scripture lies in the realisation of truth that the entire world is one and all divisions and the battle of sin and virtue are momentary.""Dharma embraces all, unites everyone, uplifts them, leads them to success. That's why dharma is the basis of life,"" the RSS chief said.""The concept of life is based on religion. If the body, mind, intellect and soul are in harmony, one remains alive.

""Then someone can ask that CT scan is not mentioned in the vedas. It's true. It's not mentioned there. But the vedas know the source of the science of CT scan,"" said Bhagwat.""Thousands of years before the advent of modern science, the vedas mentioned how far is the earth from the sun and how much time sunlight takes to reach earth.

The other seat is Budgam.As “Azadi” and autonomy slogans fade, J&K’s two major regional parties, Farooq’s NC and Mehbooba Mufti ’s PDP, have focused their campaigns largely on taunting adversaries as covert allies of “BJP” or as those “sponsored by BJP/RSS”.In Ganderbal, Farooq accused Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rasheed alias Engineer Rasheed, of having adjustments with Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). “They are their ( BJP ’s) products. Tell me why he (Rashid) was released a few days before elections. But people are aware of such tactics,” Farooq said.Rasheed was recently released for campaigning on interim bail from Delhi’s Tihar jail where he has been lodged in a terror funding case. Rasheed had defeated Omar in the Baramulla seat in this summer’s LS elections. “Rasheed has been sent to divide Muslims,” Farooq said, repeatedly questioning the timing of his release.According to the NC chief, those who once spoke about ushering in “Nizam-e-Mustafa (Islamic Rule)” are now hand in glove with BJP. “NC did not create separatism. They were talking about Pakistan and raising slogans in their favour. However, they have joined BJP now,” Farooq said in a swipe at separatist elements contesting the polls.Accusations of alignment with BJP/RSS drives voters away from such parties or candidates in the Muslim-dominated Valley. APNI party of Altaf Bukhari and Peoples Conference of Sajad Lone have suffered a dent in popularity due to claims of links with BJP. Congress breakaway leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Democratic Progressive Azad Party is hardly visible, not in the Valley, nor in Jammu division’s Chenab Valley where Muslim voters outnumber others.Mehbooba’s PDP also carries the baggage of proximity to BJP as the two had come together in a govt after the 2014 assembly polls -- the last such elections in J&K. This time, Mehbooba is trying hard to shake off the perception by slamming BJP for revoking Article 370 and ending statehood.Farooq’s NC had also partnered BJP when son Omar became a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA govt over two decades ago. However, with time, political analysts believe NC has shed the perception of proximity to BJP.On its part, BJP is striving to overcome its image of a party confined to the Hindu-dominated Jammu region. PM Narendra Modi is likely to address a rally in Srinagar in the coming weeks. Union home minister Amit Shah has been already there on the ground, addressing rallies in Jammu and holding party meetings.",National Conference (NC) president and ex-CM Farooq Abdullah vowed Monday to fight for the return of special status and move the Supreme Court again.
