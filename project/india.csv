None in opposition can match PM Modi's dynamism: Indian American philanthropist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/none-in-opposition-can-match-pm-modis-dynamism-indian-american-philanthropist/articleshow/110162829.cms,"WASHINGTON: Observing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only leader talking about the future of India in his election speeches , a prominent Indian American philanthropist said none in the opposition camp can match his dynamism .In an interview with PTI, Suresh V Shenoy said with India's economy making great strides, the country is all about opportunities.“What I find in Indian elections is that Modi is the only guy who's talking about the future. He's talking about how to implement technology ,” said Shenoy, an IITian and a successful businessman.“I'm not necessarily a Hindutva guy per se. I think that's a narrative that sort of makes political talk. But look at what India has accomplished from an economic standpoint in the last 10 years. It's incredible. They're now the fourth largest economy in the world,” he said in response to a question.Yet there are 800 million underserved people in India who too have aspirations, he said. “So, India will continue to be a cauldron of opportunity for a very large population, whereas the rest of the world is a shrinking population.”“India is all about opportunities and the future and how do you capitalise on that? America is all about, okay, we've had this prosperity, we've had world leadership, how do we maintain that?” he said.Shenoy asked how many political speeches have people heard in the recent past in America, that talk about life in 2020, 2028, or 2032. “Very few. They're talking about what's happening today,” he said.“But if you're a leader, you should be able to paint a picture of what it's going to be like 10 years from now. Whereas in Indian politics, … the others (opposition) are trying, but I think they're sort of stumbling over themselves because they're not able to match Modi's dynamism,” Shenoy said.“I mean, he talks about what life is going to be four years from now or eight years from now. He's talking about leadership, not just Indian leadership, but national leadership. Even his message of one family, one world during the G20 and all that is very appealing to people. Now the rest of the world has to catch up,” he said.","Suresh V Shenoy said with India's economy making great strides, the country is all about opportunities. “India will continue to be a cauldron of opportunity for a very large population, whereas the rest of the world is a shrinking population,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110162815,imgsize-26746,width-400,resizemode-4/110162815.jpg"

The two seaports operational in Pakistan since its inception, are both in Karachi.

Even the water that came, the tanker mafia hoarded it and sold it to the people of Karachi,"" Kamal said.""We have a total of 48,000 schools, but a new report says that out of that 11,000 are 'ghost schools'. 70 lakh children in Sindh don't go to school and a total of 2,62,00,000 children in the country don't go to school...if we just focus on this, the leaders of the country shouldn't even get proper sleep,"" the Pakistani Parliamentarian added.Kamal also criticized the neglect of Karachi's development despite its pivotal role as Pakistan's economic powerhouse. He condemned the failure to provide basic amenities such as fresh water, which has exacerbated the city's challenges.Meanwhile, Pakistan is grappling with economic hardships, including high inflation and mounting debt. The government has sought a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address these pressing issues. Talks between Pakistan and the IMF are underway, with the IMF urging Islamabad to implement comprehensive reforms in the energy sector and tax system.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term $3 billion program, that helped stave off sovereign default, however, the government has highlighted the need for a fresh, longer-term program, according to Dawn.","Pakistani lawmaker drew a stark disparity between India's space achievements and the pressing issues faced by Karachi.

Does Art 39(b) allow govt to take over your property?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/does-art-39b-allow-govt-to-take-over-your-property/articleshow/110161236.cms,"Not just an academic question

The trajectory of the case

What are the possibilities?

The real implications

A Gandhian vision of Article 39(b)

Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question — how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals.BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities.The issue is philosophical: to whom do a country’s material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the Supreme Court is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure “that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common good”.Generally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a ‘dustbin of sentiment’. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C — which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as equality and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case.Of course, the expression ‘material resources’ must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well?A recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that wealth inequality in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a ‘wealth tax’ where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in.Another example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down.The implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that ‘invisible hand’ will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth.Underlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others.During the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision.It is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b). Private property may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust.The authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy",The Supreme Court is preparing to answer this question.

Judges can't dodge explainability of their decisions: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-cant-dodge-explainability-of-their-decisions-cji/articleshow/110157792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Wednesday told a gathering of Chief Justices of J-20 countries , the judicial counterpart of G-20 nations, that judges are neither princes nor sovereigns to dodge the critical responsibility of writing judgments which everyone can understand.Speaking on 'Digital transformation and use of technology to enhance judicial efficiency ' at the Rio de Janeiro J-20 summit in Brazil, Justice Chandrachud said, ""As judges, we are neither princes nor sovereigns who are above the explainability requirement ourselves.""This probably stems from his experience of reading past judgments of the SC and HCs, which though lucidly written, would be Greek and Latin to majority of averagely educated people of India, who would find it even more difficult to fathom the logic behind judgments running into hundreds of pages on important issues, the prime example being the landmark Kesavananda Bharati verdict of 1973.CJI said judges are primarily service providers and enablers of rights-affirming societies, that is to ensure a society governed by rule of law. ""The decision itself and the road leading up to it, must be transparent, understandable to everyone with or without a legal education and must be broad enough for everyone to walk alongside,"" he said.He was commenting on a paragraph from Alexander Bickel's 'The Least Dangerous Branch', which read: ""Judges are after all perhaps the only public functionaries who are perched on a raised platform, who punish for contempt, and make important decisions about the lives of others in discrete private chambers, without the fear of electoral losses""; and Ronald Dworkin's 'Law's Empire' which stated - ""the courts are capitals of law's empire and judges are its princes."" Explaining Indian judiciary's rapid strides to optimise use of information technology in justice dispensation, CJI Chandrachud said petitions can now be filed in the SC by the click of a button and that SC's case management system, developed on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), is the largest in the world.","CJI said judges are primarily service providers and enablers of rights-affirming societies, that is to ensure a society governed by rule of law.

MTP Act

mandate: SC

NEW DELHI: Putting a premium on a 28-week-old fetus 's right to life , Supreme Court Wednesday declined a 20-year-old unmarried woman's plea to let her terminate her pregnancy, even though it had allowed rape survivors or minors to abort much beyond the 24-week outer limit prescribed under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. SC said, ""The child in the womb has a fundamental right to live.""When the woman’s counsel argued for permission to terminate the pregnancy saying she is highly traumatised because of social stigma, a bench of Justices B R Gavai, S V N Bhatti and Sandeep Mehta asked, “Her pregnancy is more than seven months old.How do you address the right to life of a foetus which is fully developed? The child in the womb also has a fundamental right to live.”The counsel said, “right of a child to live materialises only after it is born. The MTP Act only protects the mother’s well-being and health. The unmarried woman is highly traumatised and is unable to face society because of unwanted pregnancy.”But the right to life of a healthy 28-week-old foetus trumped the mother’s right to abort as the bench dismissed her appeal against the Delhi HC’s May 3 order. Justice Gavai-led bench said it cannot pass any order contrary to the mandate of MTP Act especially when the ultrasound report stated that the baby in the womb is fully developed and in fine health.Section 3 of the MTP Act provides that when the length of pregnancy is within 20 weeks it may be terminated by a registered medical practitioner if an opinion is reached in good faith that continuance of the same would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant women or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is a risk to the child or that it will suffer from abnormalities.Justice Subramonium Prasad of Delhi HC had rejected her plea for termination of pregnancy: “Since the foetus is normal, and there is no danger to the petitioner to carry on with the pregnancy, feticide would neither be ethical nor legally permissible. The petitioner would have to be induced for delivering the child and such delivery could be detrimental to mental and physical health of the newborn since it would be a pre-term delivery. It could also be detrimental to the mother for her future pregnancies.”",Supreme Court declined a 20-year-old unmarried woman's plea to let her terminate her pregnancy. Court allowed rape survivors or minors to abort much beyond the 24-week outer limit prescribed under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. Right to life of a healthy 28-week-old foetus trumped the mother's right to abort.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110157507,imgsize-156566,width-400,resizemode-4/110157507.jpg"

For Punjab, it suggested an increase of 13% and 15% for govt employment and education respectively.NCBC's 'advisory' comes amid an intensifying battle between BJP, on the one hand, and TMC, AAP and Congress, on the other, over quotas. The INDIA bloc has alleged that BJP is seeking 400 seats so that it can abolish quotas by amending the Constitution. BJP has retaliated by citing moves by Congress to cut into the quota for OBCs by declaring Muslims as a whole as ""backward"" in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.NCBC chairman Hansraj Ahir told TOI that he had been taking up this issue with the two states for quite some time but they were yet to comply.

Addressing a rally in Kanjurmarg East on Tuesday night, Pawar strongly criticized Modi and said ""official power was being blatantly misused during the Modi era in the past ten years.""He alleged whoever criticised Modi was being jailed and this was unwarranted.In another rally in Dindori LS constituency on Wednesday, Pawar said Modi is the first PM to create a divide on religious and caste lines to garner votes. At a rally at Vani, he said the aim of the PM should be to keep different sections of society united. ""However, instead of keeping the country united, PM Modi is doing exactly the opposite. He is creating a divide between castes and religions to garner votes during the LS polls,"" Pawar said.In Mumbai, Pawar said prices of LPG cylinders had doubled in ten years. Recalling that during LS elections in 2019, Modi had urged women to ""salute cylinders"" while going to vote, Pawar accused the BJP govt of being responsible for rising prices of gas cylinders, petrol and diesel. He said the govt was to be blamed for inflation which impacted the common man.Pawar said there were many youths in the country who were restless and unemployed. ""Instead of giving jobs to them, BJP was shifting factories and industries from here to Gujarat,"" he said, advising Gujarat govt to set up its own factories and not take away factories from Maharashtra.At the same rally, UBT Sena MP Sanjay Raut said ""if we want to save democracy, everyone has to take the responsibility of sending this Kamalabai (referring to BJP) to the old-age home.""He said one should remember ""BJP is the enemy of all of us, and therefore we have decided to take up mashal (flaming torch).

A big Indian community of students doesn’t come with a “homely” feeling.""Explaining her stance, Pattar highlighted what she referred to as 'toxic Indian patterns' within the community, such as excessive drama, unprofessionalism, lack of positive role models, absence of leadership or mentorship for juniors, self-centered behavior, cliques, gossiping, and a lack of seriousness about the future.Pattar further emphasized, ""If you plan to move out of the country, make sure you are also staying away from that mindset, attitude, and nature of people.

Some users supported her perspective, stressing the importance of broadening horizons and avoiding comfort zones within familiar communities, while others countered that personal success abroad hinges on individual efforts rather than the ethnicity or background of fellow students.One user said, ""I respectfully disagree. Having a community of Indian students can provide a sense of familiarity and support, especially in a new country.

The study analysed several studies conducted in high-income countries on the fallout of public hospitals being converted to for-profit or not-for-profit facilities and of services by public hospitals being outsourced.The paper published by researchers at the department of social policy and intervention in Oxford University reviewed studies from the US, Germany, the UK, Sweden, South Korea etc.It found that hospitals converting from public to private ownership status tended to make higher profits than public hospitals that do not convert, primarily through the selective intake of patients and reductions in staff numbers. The authors stated that their analysis provided evidence that challenges the justifications for healthcare privatisation and concluded that the scientific support for further privatisation of healthcare services is weak.The review found that the conversion reduced ""the comprehensiveness and generosity of care"". Privatised hospitals decreased their staffing levels, especially of the highest qualified nurses. It found that outsourcing corresponded with fewer staff members employed per patient, especially true of cleaning staff. Interestingly, the number of physicians was not reduced after privatisation, whereas most other staffing categories were.""Overall, the results suggest that accessibility of care might be affected in different ways, with more precise appointment times and reduced waiting times in some cases, but with effects that could disadvantage some groups, particularly those whose treatments have low profits for the private sector,"" stated the paper.Those who advocate outsourcing services to the private sector argue that financial accountability compels private companies to ensure patients' well-being and eliminates unnecessary bureaucracy. It is also argued that competition from private facilities improves performance across the entire health system as all providers are incentivised to deliver better quality services, especially in a single-payer or purchaser system when the pricesare largely fixed. However, the review noted that ""the profit motive might not always result in desired outcomes"". It pointed out that competitive markets could also discourage providers from revealing information on the quality of their services.""The evidence compiled here does not align with the expectations of mixed markets, namely that they would improve quality by increasing competition,"" stated the study, adding that the findings suggested that some areas of the welfare state, such as education and health care, might be structured in ways that make them less amenable to the kinds of incentives that operate in other markets.","The study analysed several studies conducted in high-income countries on the fallout of public hospitals being converted to for-profit or not-for-profit facilities.

While Rahul was silent on Naveen and his trusted aide V K Pandian, he singled out the PM, accusing him of working to protect the interests of a handful of corporate houses.In sharp contrast, at a poll rally in Kendrapada a fortnight ago, Rahul had talked of a 'BJP-BJD bonhomie', alleging that the two were in a relationship, ""like it is the case in Telangana between BRS and BJP"".Rahul's silence on Naveen at the Balangir rally comes four days after Modi attacking the CM for the first time in these elections when he said: ""How can people entrust their children's future to a CM who doesn't even know the names of Odisha's districts despite governing the state for 24 years?""Rahul Gandhi said BJP will destroy the Constitution if voted to office at the Centre, adding: “I want to tell every BJP worker that let alone BJP or Narendra Modi, no power in this earth can make a scratch on this book.”Holding the Constitution in his hand, Rahul said: “If they harm this book, then they will see what the people and Congress party can do.” He alleged that top functionaries of BJP have said if they win they would abolish reservation meant for people from the backward class.“They have sold the entire public sector to the capitalists. All they did was protect the interests of 22 rich corporates. In India, there are at least 50% people from the backward class, 15% Dalits, 8% STs, 15% minority and 5% general caste poor. So, the poor constitute more than 90%. But in India, their share is nowhere,” Rahul said on Wednesday.“You pay the GST, but their (corporates) loan is waived,” he said, adding that Congress is going to do a revolutionary work to help women and youths. “Every month starting July, women will get Rs 8,500 in their accounts while every graduate will get a job for one year. In one year, women will get Rs 1 lakh in their accounts,” he reiterated. He also said daily wage under MGNREGS will be increased from Rs 250 to Rs 400 after they come to power on June 4. Before his public address, Rahul participated in a motorcycle rally in Balangir town.","Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was silent on Naveen Patnaik and his party BJD at an election rally in Balangir on Wednesday.

Tiger reserves stand on a higher pedestal than national parks and sanctuaries. Whatever protection is accorded to national parks and sanctuaries would automatically apply to tiger reserves, which would also require additional protection.""Bhati told the court that the state has already expanded the area of Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary and taken necessary protective measures. The mining activities have been taking place since the 1970s and these are outside the CTH.The Justice Gavai-led green bench said whatever activity is taking place within the buffer zone of tiger reserves needs to be shifted out and cited the examples of Tadoba and Melghat tiger reserves where all villages inside the tiger habitats have been shifted out.""How can there be mining activity within one km of CTH? There cannot be any activity within the one km no go zone of protected areas.

Congress wanted to spend 15% of Budget on Muslims: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-wanted-to-spend-15-of-budget-on-muslims-pm-modi/articleshow/110157229.cms,"Only exposing Cong bid to divide country on basis of religion:

PM Modi

NASHIK/KALYAN: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday claimed Congress had drawn up a plan to spend 15% of the Union Budget exclusively on Muslims when it was in office and said it now plans to carry forward the same ""agenda"" to ""appease its votebank"" and divide it into a ""Muslim budget"" and a "" Hindu budget"".""Congress us samay chahti thi ki desh ke saare Budget ka pandrah pratishat sirf Musalmano par kharch ho,"" Modi said, adding the govt led by Manmohan Singh then had to shelve the plan after strong opposition from him in his role as Gujarat chief minister and BJP.""Lekin ab ye saare purane agenda lagu karne pe tule hain (But now they are bent on reintroducing their previous agendas),"" he said at a rally at Pimpalgaon Baswant.""If Congress is elected, it will make two budgets on the basis of religion. I will not allow the Budget to be divided as a 'Hindu budget' and 'Muslim budget' and will not allow quotas based on religion,"" he said in Kalyan at another rally.PM Modi, who has been accused by his rivals of polarising rhetoric during LS poll campaign, went on the offensive, saying he was not the one doing so but it was Congress, which was being divisive.He said he was “being accused by their (Congress) ecosystem of raking up Hindu-Muslim issues” but he was only exposing Congress’s attempts to divide the country on the basis of religion.“Should I not expose their designs? Should I think about my image and not speak about it at all? I will not allow my country to be divided like that. Aren’t all Hindustanis one?” he said. He added, “They had to create a nation in the name of religion and so they did. Congress was helpless and gave it. Now you will say ‘Hindu budget,’ ‘Muslim budget.’ Can this country have a separate budget for Hindus and Muslims?”Modi said Congress had shown the “green flag” to distribution of money on the lines of religion and had even asked state govts to spend 15% of their budget only on members of a minority community. “Aap kalpana kar sakte hain ki Budget ka is prakar se tukde karna kitna khatarnak vichar hai. Aur aap jaante hai Congress ke liye minority sirf ek hi hai — unka apna priya vote bank (You can imagine how dangerous the thinking of dividing the budget this way is. For Congress, there is only one minority community — its dear vote bank),” Modi said.Describing Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena UBT again as ‘Nakli Sena’, he said it had joined Congress and was mum on all such things and also on Congress’s clean chit to Pakistan and terrorists. He challenged Sena UBT to get ‘Congress’s Shehzada’ (Rahul Gandhi) to say five positive sentences about Veer Savarkar. Modi said the ‘Nakli Sena’ would merge with Congress after LS poll results and “would cease to exist.”He also accused Rahul of insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, indirectly referring to a clip where the Congress MP was handed a bust of Shivaji on a dais during a recent poll rally.The PM also said in Kalyan that he has prepared a blueprint for work to be done in the first 100 days after formation of his govt and appealed to youth to send him innovative suggestions about what work should be done so that he could make it a target of “the first 125 days instead of 100” and could work on their suggestions for 25 days separately.Modi reiterated Congress was planning to give Muslims the quota meant for SCs, STs and economically weaker sections. “Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar never intended to have reservation on religious lines,” he said.Modi asserted Congress would lose the LS polls in such a way that it would be difficult for it to even get the tag of main opposition party .",PM Narendra Modi claims Congress had drawn up a plan to spend 15% of the Union Budget exclusively on Muslims when it was in office.

Aadhaar linking

can stop double voting’

Candidates with less than 30% vote share have won elections. That's changed now

Shanti keeps her hair well-oiled every election, preparing for a ""picnic"" - voting at home in Mumbai's Panvel as well as her native village in Maharashtra. She isn't alone. Countless others across the country are taking the one-person one-vote principle for a ride in a seamy sideshow of the great Indian festival of democracy.With large numbers of migrants, floating populations and many voter IDs not linked to Aadhaar yet, double voting is more common than many would like to believe, and most officials are in denial or profess ignorance.""We were advised to oil our hair. Just before my turn (to vote), I was asked to ensure my index finger is oily by rubbing it against my hair. As soon as the ink was applied, I rubbed my finger back again in my oily hair and most of the ink was gone,"" Shanti said, recalling how she and many others in Mumbai from their Raireshwar village pull off the double act. Raireshwar is a few hours' drive from Panvel and ""the journey together to vote is like a picnic"", she adds.Ahmedabad's Neeraj offers a peek into another ""ride"". The 28-year-old vegetable vendor was among many herded into a bus arranged by a major political party and taken to vote in their native Rajasthan on April 24, two days before polling day.Neeraj voted again May 7, in Ahmedabad-West. ""I have two voter IDs. I went to Rajasthan to vote with my family in Sirohi last month,"" Neeraj said, holding back his full name.Satish Patel didn’t bother with any hide and seek, posting pictures of himself with ink-stained forefingers on both hands to claim he had voted twice “legally” in Gujarat’s Navsari Lok Sabha seat. Patel, a former councillor of Congress, joined BJP in March this year.In Neeraj’s case, Gujarat chief electoral officer P Bharathi insisted voting twice was illegal but said she would need to verify Neeraj’s case. “We have not come across any complaints of people voting in Gujarat and also in their native places,” Bharathi said.On Patel’s claim, the Navsari collector dismissed it as fake and said he had cast the ballot the second time as an “assistant voter” for his disabled daughter.In Maharashtra’s Chandrapur, at least 50% of the residents of 14 villages straddling the Telangana border cast votes in neighbouring Adilabad on May 13. Flaunting dual voter ID cards, they did not miss voting in Chandrapur either, during the first phase on April 19. Villagers said the Adilabad administration had set up six booths in these 14 Maharashtra villages. As per Maharashtra govt records, there are 5,117 voters in these villages.Adilabad collector Rajarshi Shah told TOI he was “busy with elections and will look into the issue after he gets free”, without refuting the dual voting trend.His counterpart in Chandrapur, Vinay Gowda, who had earlier called it a criminal offence, refused to answer TOI’s calls and text messages.The northeast is not an outlier in this practice. The village of Ranibari, in the foothills of Meghalaya, is “part of both Guwahati and Shillong LS constituencies”. Living along the disputed Assam-Meghalaya border areas, these “dual voters” have been exercising their franchise in Assam for decades, even after creation of Meghalaya in 1972.Despite Meghalaya officials’ stance against double voting, residents with valid identification proof from both states continue to participate in elections in both states. Officials struggle to check it. This time, many of the hamlet’s nearly 200-odd people voted on May 7 in the Guwahati LS seat, after having done so for the Shillong LS seat on April 19.“With poll officers from both Assam and Meghalaya approaching us, we got voter IDs made. When the authorities from both sides want us to vote, can we sit idle at home on election day?” says Pranab Rangsha, (56), headman of Ranibari village.Manash Jyoti Bora, an election officer in Assam’s Kamrup, believes only the completion of Aadhaar-voter ID linking will check “dual voters” while pointing out that only over 50% of voters have completed such coupling. Meghalaya chief electoral officer BDR Tiwari said he was “unaware of villagers possessing two voter IDs cards” or voting twice.(With inputs from Hemali Chhapia in Mumbai, Vaibhav Ganjapure and Mazhar Ali in Nagpur, Paul John and Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad, Kangkan Kalita in Guwahati)","Double voting is more common than many would like to believe, and most officials are in denial or profess ignorance.

Sethi on Wednesday claimed that there had been no fresh incidents of forest fire in the last three days and that as of today forest fires are continuing at three places.Sethi suggested setting up of a six-member expert committee to give comprehensive suggestions for a permanent mechanism to control forest fire in the state, but he was countered by amicus curiae K Parameswaran who informed the bench that there is already a National Forest Fire Plan and Uttarakhand Forest Fire Mitigation Policy of 2022, all of which are only on paper.Sethi then attempted to shift the blame on lack of funding from the Union government, to which the bench said there should be no problem for the Centre to release funds to the state, both being ruled by the same political party.Parameswaran and senior advocate Rajiv Datta said the main problem in tackling the recurring forest fires in the state is the large vacancies in the posts of foresters and forest guards, who are the first to detect fireand take remedial measures. The amicus said there are around 300 vacancies among 1,729 sanctioned post of foresters, and nearly 1,400 vacancies in the 3,650 posts of forest guards.""If the fire line is not cleared of inflammable pine needles prior to onset of summer season, the forest fires are bound to spread to large areas, as happened this year,"" Datta said. On a query from the bench, the state's principal chief conservator of forest V Mohan said an unprecedented dry spell for two months from March to May this year is a major reason for the forest fires. SC said that with climate change, such variation in weather conditions is likely to rise. Mohan said 1,250 vacant posts of foresters and guards have been filled and soon the other vacant posts will be filled up.","Justices B R Gavai, S V N Bhatti and Sandeep Mehta told state's deputy advocate general Jatinder K Sethi.

While Congress’s manifesto resolves to implement personal law, Sharia law. Therefore, people of the country have to decide if this country will now function as per UCC or Sharia law. An impression of Muslim League is seen in Congress’s manifesto as it is playing politics of appeasement,” said Pushkar Dhami .Dhami said, “Congress will snatch right (of reservation) of SC, ST, OBC communities and give it to a community as they have done so in Karnataka already. Leaders of the arrogant (INDIA) alliance are openly announcing to give reservation to Muslim community. Therefore, you need a strong government led by Modi Ji, which will lead the country in the world.”Dhami also hit out at opposition parties for ‘stealing’ word ‘guarantee’ from BJP. In his address at Haryana’s Ambala, Dhami mostly talked about works done by BJP in Uttarakhand state and nationally, in his attempt to woo voters for Kataria. He said they are people who are seeking evidence of surgical strikes from armed forces.“They are misleading farmers and fulfilling their political interests. While the truth is that Modi Ji’s tenure has done most work for farmers since independence,” said Dhami.“BJP does what it promises at any cost and this is what is the guarantee of Narendra Modi Ji. Just by stealing, word ‘guarantee’ does become theirs (AAP’s or Congress’s). Today, many people are talking about several types of guarantees, but the actual guarantee of working style is Modi Ji’s guarantee,” said Dhami.Dhami also hailed Modi for 33% reservation to women by passing the Women Reservation Act, building Ram Temple, ending Triple Talaq.“They (opposition leaders) were given an invitation to attend the consecration of Ram Temple, but they did not come. They never wanted the dream of Ram Temple to come true, but this happened due to the leadership of Modi Ji. The arrogant alliance also disrespects Sanatan Dharam,” said Dhami.Dhami said ""late Ambala MP Rattan Lal Kataria had close relations with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and he was told about his demise by the PM himself during an event. He added Rattan Lal Kataria did a lot of work for Ambala being an MP from here and now, to take forward his work, the responsibility is on Banto Kataria.""“I am sure that Banto Kataria Ji is going to win by a huge margin from Ambala and she is going to break records of 2014 and 2019,” said Dhami.“Under the leadership of Narendra Modi Ji, India’s honour has increased at the world level and today, Indians irrespective of the country they are in, feel proud of their Indian identity. We have jumped to fifth economy from eleventh and soon, we are going to be the third largest economy. The resolution of developed India is to become number one economy in the world. Every company in the world today wants to invest in India,” said Dhami, while highlighting the developments done during the BJP government in the last 10 years.Dhami also highlighted welfare schemes started by BJP for poor people.“Uttarakhand state has taken the honour of becoming the first state in the country to implement Uniform Civil Code.

My every moment is for you, my every moment is for the country, that is why I say 24/7 for 2047.During this time, while questioning the efficiency of Rahul Gandhi , Modi without naming him said that the way India is developing rapidly in every field today, who can take the country from where we have reached today?

Whereas Modi is exposing their dirty secrets. I want to give an example to Congress and this example is recorded in history, I challenge Congress to answer this question of mine"".PM Modi while repeating his earlier statement that Congress openly said that ""Muslims have a right over the resources of the country and Manmohan Singh ji used to say it and during that time I was chief minister and I had opposed it.""PM Modi also claimed that Congress and its allies had planned to divide the country's development budget. They had thought of making a Hindu budget and a Muslim budget. Congress wanted 15% of the budget to be allocated for Muslims.""They (Muslim) had to create a religion in the name of the country and so they did. Congress was helpless and gave it. Now you will say Hindu budget, Muslim budget. Can this country have a separate budget for Hindus and Muslims?"" PM asked the crowd.""Congress was committing this sin and at that time I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and I strongly opposed it. If Congress and its alliance come to power, they will do the same but is it right to divide the country on the basis of religion?,"" PM added.PM Modi said, ""Such party should not be allowed to win even a single seat in the entire country"".PM Modi accused Rahul that the ""prince"" of Congress is playing the same old game of appeasement by giving example of Muslim reservation given by Congress in Karnataka from OBC quota.PM said that before 2014 government there used to be bomb blasts all over the country and attacks on the border, but this did not happen after 2014.During this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called out the previous governments and said that the previous government used to do peace talks when there was an attack, used to fly doves of peace, used to say please please do not attack us, these people shamed the brave land of India, but after 2014, Pakistan does not threaten India. Because we responded to their attack. We did air strikes strikes.PM Modi also said that now Pakistan has stopped giving atomic threats to us, but now this work is done by Congress people who asks us to respect Pakistan saying they have atomic power.During the rally PM Modi also accused Uddhav Thackeray that he does not see the mistakes of the prince of Congress who insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .The ""fake"" Shiv Sena has blindfolded itself, they do not even see the insult of Veer Savarkar by the prince of Congress. I challenge the people of nakli Shiv Sena to make the prince of Congress say 5 sentences about Veer Savarkar. They will not be able to do so.He also accused ""Nakli"" Shiv Sena for using bomb blast accused for their election campaign.","PM Narendra Modi said that if the Congress government is elected, it will make two budgets on the basis of religion.

"Sting of people voting for Congress this time, will be felt by BJP: Bhupinder Hooda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sting-of-people-voting-for-congress-this-time-will-be-felt-by-bjp-bhupinder-hooda/articleshow/110156145.cms,"AMBALA : Former Haryana chief minister (CM) and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday said that the sting of people voting for Congress this time, will be felt by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ).Hooda reached Ambala Cantonment to campaign for Congress Ambala Lok Sabha candidate Varun Chaudhary. During his visit, he addressed several events when he appealed to the public to vote for Congress.Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan and former minister Nirmal Singh were also present with Hooda.In his address, Hooda said, “People of Haryana will vote for MSP guarantee, not for lathi and bullets to farmers, for 32 lakh government jobs, not for record breaking unemployment, for annual apprenticeship guarantee of Rs 1 lakh and not for sending youth to work as labourers in war zone Israel. People will vote for guarantee of vote and not for fear and crime.”“Congress is asking for votes in the name of development and welfare schemes, while BJP is asking for votes without showing any work or future plan. It is obvious that public votes will go to Congress and the sting of these votes will be felt by BJP,” said Hooda.Speaking about unemployment, Hooda said, “There is anger in the entire state including Northern Haryana that the BJP government forced our youth to leave the country by spreading massive unemployment. The youth are convinced that they have no future in the country under BJP rule. It is the reason why every second youth wants to go abroad through dunkie (illegal) routes or any other means. BJP policies have separated young children from their old parents. Congress wants to make Haryana a state from where no youth is forced to migrate from the country.”In his address, Chaudhary Udaibhan claimed that BJP wants to make India an undemocratic country like China and Russia by ""strangulating the Constitution"". “Now BJP does not care at all about bringing back black money, bullet train, smart city, rising prices of diesel-petrol, gas cylinder rates and double income of farmers, nor does BJP want any party to talk about the grassroots issues of the people. That is why those in power spread lies about the 5 justices and 25 guarantees of the Congress, but now the manifesto of Congress has reached the hands and hearts of the people,” he said.In his address, Congress Ambala candidate Varun Chaudhary said, “Lakhs of martyrs have sacrificed their lives to bring democracy in India. There can be no place for dictatorship in this country. Today every person is feeling pressure. The time has come to teach BJP a lesson, which crushed the voices of every section of the society including farmers, labourers, employees, panches-sarpanches, traders and businessmen either by lathis or bullets.”Varun promised that he will raise the voice of Ambala in Lok Sabha after being elected as MP, similar to the way he raised the voice for Mullana assembly constituency.","Hooda reached Ambala Cantonment to campaign for Congress Ambala Lok Sabha candidate Varun Chaudhary.
