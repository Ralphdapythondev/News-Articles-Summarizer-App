"Rahul Gandhi's remarks a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva: RSS functionary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-remarks-a-sinister-attempt-to-demonise-hindus-hindutva-rss-functionary/articleshow/111647489.cms,"NEW DELHI: A senior RSS functionary, in the latest edition of Sangh inspired “Organiser” weekly, has maintained that the recent statement by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament that ‘those who called themselves Hindu are violent, spread hatred and falsehood’ is a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva and a scripted conspiracy to divide society by pushing a repackaged Nehruvian Secularism on to the Indian psyche.“Although there has been an attempt by Left-Liberal-Islamist ecosystem to create a binary between Hinduism and Hindutva, their efforts did not bear fruit due to their declining political clout. But with a slightly renewed mandate in the recent Lok Sabha election , they try to push this dangerous narrative upon the country,” senior Sangh functionary J Nandakumar has written in the latest edition of the Weekly.Nandkumar has further stated that the statement made by Gandhi was a plain attempt to create confusion and chaos in the country and among Hindus in particular and reap political harvest.He has also claimed that Hindu Dharma does not give any individual or sect a mandate to brand any person ‘non-believer’ or fake. “By doing this, with his lopsided understanding of the concept of Shiva, Rahul Gandhi has tried to graft Abrahamic approach on the Hindu Dharma,” Nandakumar has said.The RSS functionary’s remarks are a counter to parts of Gandhi’s first speech as leader of opposition recently in the Lok Sabha where he made mends when Prime Minister Narendra Modi objected, saying, ""Calling entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.""The RSS functionaries’ detailed observations carried prominently in the Weekly magazine inspired by the Sangh is yet another example of its firm support to the BJP and its bid complementing the political outfit over narratives targeted against them and their common ideologies.Taking a cue from PM Modi equating Gandhi’s remarks as “Balak Buddhi”, the RSS functionary has stated that “several commentators” have dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s statement as a juvenile attempt to corner the BJP leadership.“Raising the photograph of Bhagwan Shiva (thank God, he spared Allah – so his head is in the right place) in the house was not without a purpose. It’s part of a well-thought-out global plan to divide and emaciate the Hindu society by forces who have their handlers in foreign lands,” Nandakumar has observed.He has also highlighted how the Congress associates, especially in South, have already planned to build an ‘architecture of hate and anarchy’ by pushing the old Aryan-Dravidian narrative in a new format.“A ‘Muruga conclave’ is being planned to pit Bhagwan Karthikeya against ‘North Indian invader’ Bhagwan Ram. Sometime ago, a DMK leader had said: ‘Who is Ram? Ram has no relevance in the South.’ By this exercise, they propose to drive wedge between Saivaites and Vaishnavaites,” he has written.","A senior RSS functionary has maintained that the recent statement by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament is a sinister attempt to demonise Hindus, Hindutva and a scripted conspiracy to divide society. “By doing this, with his lopsided understanding of the concept of Shiva, Rahul Gandhi has tried to graft Abrahamic approach on the Hindu Dharma,” he has said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111647486,imgsize-821680,width-400,resizemode-4/111647486.jpg"

""There is a lot of misinformation and theatrics by the opposition to demotivate them,"" Vaishnaw said.Vaishnaw highlighted various steps taken by the Railways to improve the working conditions of train drivers. ""Duty hours of loco pilots are carefully monitored. Rest is provided meticulously after trips. The average duty hours are maintained within prescribed hours,"" he wrote. ""The average is less than 8 hours in the month of June this year. Only under exigencies, the trip duration exceed the prescribed hours,"" he added.This statement comes after Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, met a group of loco pilots last week. The pilots had complained of ""inadequate rest due to understaffing,"" and Gandhi assured them he would raise their issues in Parliament.Vaishnaw addressed these concerns by pointing out the significant improvements made since 2014. ""Pilots operate locomotives from loco cab, and before 2014, cabs were in very bad shape. Since 2014, cabs have been improved with ergonomic seats, and more than 7,000 loco cabs are air-conditioned.

He added that in many running rooms, foot massagers are also provided, noting, ""Incidentally, this was criticized by Congress without understanding the working conditions of loco pilots.""Vaishnaw also emphasized the ongoing recruitment process aimed at addressing understaffing issues. ""In the past few years, a major recruitment exercise was completed, and 34,000 running staff have been recruited. The recruitment process for 18,000 running staff is currently in process,"" he said.""The attempt to demoralize the railway family with fake news will fail.

'1986 Act cannot prevail over ...': What SC's big judgment says on alimony for Muslim women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1986-act-cannot-prevail-over-what-scs-big-judgment-says-on-alimony-for-muslim-women-section-125-crpc-maintenance-religion/articleshow/111633619.cms,"What the court said:

Section 125 CrPC, which deals with a wife's legal right to maintenance, covers Muslim women as well

Maintenance is a right of married women, not charity, and applies to all married women regardless of religion

The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 will not prevail over the secular and religion neutral provision of Section 125 of CrPC, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said

The court highlighted the necessity for husbands to provide financial support to their wives, and suggested practical measures such as maintaining joint bank accounts and sharing ATM access to ensure economic stability for women within the household

If a Muslim woman is divorced during the pendency of a Section 125 CrPC petition, she can take recourse to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, in addition to continuing the Section 125 petition.

The court dismissed an appeal by a Muslim man challenging a maintenance order in favor of his ex-wife under Section 125 CrPC. He had argued that the 1986 Act, which was enacted to nullify the Supreme Court's Shah Bano judgment, should take precedence.

However, the Supreme Court has now firmly established that Muslim women can seek maintenance under the ""religion neutral"" Section 125 CrPC, in line with the spirit of the Shah Bano case.

""We are hereby dismissing the criminal appeal with the major conclusion that Section 125 would be applicable to all women...,"" Justice Nagarathna said while pronouncing the verdict.

Applicability of Section 125 CrPC to Muslim women

The Supreme Court ruled that Section 125 CrPC, which deals with a wife's right to maintenance, applies to all married women including Muslim women.

This overrules the argument that divorced Muslim women can only seek maintenance under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.

Practical measures for financial support

The court highlighted the need for husbands to recognize the role and sacrifices of homemaker wives

It suggested practical measures like maintaining joint bank accounts and sharing ATM access to ensure economic stability for women within the household.

NCW welcomes judgment



NEW DELHI: In a landmark decision that is bound to have far-reaching implications, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CrPC ), which is applicable to all women ""irrespective of religion"".The Supreme Court's ruling establishes the right of Muslim women to seek maintenance from their husbands under the general law, and encourages practical steps to ensure financial security for women in the marriage.NCW chief Rekha Sharma welcomed the Supreme Court's landmark ruling that affirms the right of Muslim women to seek maintenance, saying the decision is a significant step towards ensuring gender equality and justice for all women, regardless of their religion.","Supreme Court rules that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CrPC ), which is applicable to all women ""irrespective of religion"" The court highlighted the need for husbands to recognize the role and sacrifices of homemaker wives.

A year later, Navinal's villagers, along with other Mundra villages, approached the high court, arguing that they were left with only 45 acres, inadequate for their cattle needs.Following the villagers' plea, the state government pledged in 2014 to allocate 387 hectares of grazing land to Navinal. The commitment, however, was not fulfilled.In 2015, the state government filed a petition for review in the high court, arguing that only 17 hectares of land were realistically available for allocation to the panchayat.The state government later suggested allocating the remaining land, located approximately seven kilometers away. However, villagers objected, arguing it was impractical for their cattle to travel such a long distance.On July 5, an affidavit was submitted informing the bench that the state government has opted to reclaim approximately 108 hectares or 266 acres of grazing land previously allocated to APSEZ.","The court had asked the government on July 5 to restore the land to a Kutch village, almost 19 years afterit was allotted to Adani Port and Special Economic Zone Ltd.

NEW DELHI: Mihir Shah , the main accused in the Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case, was on Wednesday sent to police custody till July 16 by a local court. Mihir was arrested on Tuesday after a nearly 60-hour statewide manhunt.Mihir, who is the son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah , had been absconding since July 7 when he rammed his BMW into a two-wheeler in the Worli area of south-central Mumbai, resulting in the death of 45-year-old Kaveri Nakhwa , who was riding pillion, while her husband Pradeep survived with injuries.Seeking Mihir's custody, the police on Wednesday told Sewri court in Mumbai that they have to find out how many people helped (the accused) after the incident, and who all helped him to hide for so many days.The police further said they need to find out whether the accused has a driving license and what happened to the number plate of the car, which was discarded by the accused after the accident.The police had asked for 7-days custody of Mihir.Accused Mihir Shah's counsel told the court that the driver and Mihir were questioned after sitting in front of each other. The police have also taken the phone, the counsel said while questioning the need for police custody.The lawyer also said Mihir was taken to the accident spot on Tuesday where he narrated the entire incident.The advocate told the court that the driver's and Mihir's statement matched, adding that the police have not mentioned the grounds for the arrest of Mihir.Chilling details of the accident emerged in CCTV footage produced by the police in the court on Monday.The footage shows Kaveri Nakhwa being dragged by the BMW for 1.5 km before the car stopped.Mihir and his driver Rajrishi Bidawat pulled the woman off the bonnet, placed her on the road, and swapped seats.

The Nov 8, 2016, notification had allowed deposition of demonetised currency notes in banks till Dec 30, 2016. Another notification issued on Dec 31, 2016, made it an offence to hold demonetised currency notes after Dec 30 and made the holder liable for penaltyKohli said apart from the bank being obliged to receive demonetised currency notes presented before it by the KYC-compliant company, it was also obligatory for RBI to ensure that the company received the amount in exchange of valid currency notes as each demonetised note contained a written promise by RBI governor to pay the bearer an amount specified on the currency note. The bench issued fresh notice to Axis Bank and asked it to respond within three weeks after RBI counsel said court would have to hear the bank and find out whether it had a valid reason not to accept the demonetised notes.

As the state's grievances are mainly against CBI, it could not have filed a suit without making the central agency a party.Dealing with Mehta's submissions, the bench said, ""We find that SG's contention that even if CBI, being an independent agency, is considered to be an instrumentality of the State under Article 12 of Constitution, it cannot be equated with Government of India as contemplated under Article 131 of Constitution, in our view, holds no water.""Writing the 74-page judgment, Justice Gavai said, ""In our view, CBI is an organ or a body, which is established by and which is under superintendence of Govt of India in view of the statutory scheme as enacted by the DSPE Act.""He said, ""No doubt that powers of superintendence of central govt would not relate to superintendence of investigation of a particular case (which is vested with Central Vigilance Commission by a judgment of SC) and the probe agency (CBI) would always be entitled to investigate the offences independently.""""However, that would not water down the administrative control and superintendence of DSPE that vests with Centre. In that view of the matter, we find that the contention in that regard needs to be rejected,"" the bench said.It said, ""It is the case of WB (plaintiff) that CBI is established (under Delhi Special Police Establishment Act) by the Union govt (defendant), its exercise of powers is controlled by the defendant and its functioning is also under the superintendence of the defendant. Therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has not made out any cause of action against the defendant.""SC said under the DSPE Act, CBI can probe a case in a state only after a notification is issued by Centre specifying the case and area involved in the particular case with prior consent of the state govt.West Bengal in its suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution had argued that it withdrew general consent on Nov 16, 2018, CBI could not have continued to register cases and exercise its powers under the DSPE Act. ""Continuation of registration of cases and exercise of powers after withdrawal of the consent is an act of constitutional overreach,"" the state contended.","Supreme Court trashes the multiple grounds cited by Centre to seek dismissal of West Bengal's constitutional suit.

Supreme Court: Muslim women entitled to maintenance under CrPC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-muslim-women-entitled-to-maintenance-under-crpc/articleshow/111643999.cms,"Supreme Court: Parliament never sought to limit divorced Muslim woman's rights to 'iddat' period

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Wednesday said women, irrespective of their faith, were entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code and rejected the argument that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, or personal laws of different communities barred them from taking advantage of maintenance guaranteed under the secular law.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih held that it was for the Muslim woman to decide which of the two laws or both she should take recourse to. ""Maintenance is a facet of gender parity and enabler of equality, not charity,"" Justice Nagarathna said.In separate but concurring judgments, the judges said Section 125 of CrPC applied to all married women, including Muslims. It said the provision was a measure for social justice to protect weaker sections, irrespective of applicable personal laws of the parties.Rights of maintenance under both ""exist parallelly"" to ensure right to seek maintenance for divorced Muslim woman, Justice Masih said.We are inclined to conclude that equivalent rights of maintenance ascertained under both, the secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973 and the personal law provision of Section 3 of the 1986 Act, parallelly exist in their distinct domains and jurisprudence, thereby, leading to their harmonious construction and continued existence of the right to seek maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman under the provisions of CrPC 1973 despite the enactment of the 1986 Act,"" Justice Masih said, adding that Parliament never sought to restrict the rights of a divorced Muslim woman to the 'iddat' period. 'Iddat' refers to the period of time for which a Muslim woman must wait before she can remarry, 3 months in case of a divorce.The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act was enacted by the Rajiv Gandhi govt in response to pressure from Muslim groups and politicians who were upset with the SC verdict in the Shah Bano case where the court had ordered that the old and indigent divorcee from Bhopal be given a monthly maintenance of Rs 125 per month.Justice Nagarathna said Parliament's intent in enacting the 1986 law was to enhance the rights of a divorced Muslim woman in addition to what she would have been entitled to under Section 125 of CrPC. She said if the intent was to curtail the rights of a divorced Muslim woman, then the clause of 'notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force' would not have found a place in Section 3 and Parliament did not simultaneously or at any time thereafter create any bar for a divorced Muslim woman from claiming maintenance under Section 125.""One cannot read Section 3 of the 1986 Act containing the non obstante clause so as to restrict or diminish the right to maintenance of a divorced Muslim woman under Section 125 of CrPC and neither is it a substitute for the latter. Such an interpretation would be regressive, anti-divorced Muslim woman and contrary to Articles 14, 15(1) and (3) as well as Article 39(e) of the Constitution,"" Justice Nagarathna said.""Therefore, a technical or pedantic interpretation of the 1986 Act would stultify not merely gender justice but also the constitutional right of access to justice for aggrieved Muslim divorced women who are in dire need of maintenance. This court would not countenance unjust or Faustian bargains being imposed on women. The emphasis is on sufficient maintenance, not minimal amount. After all, maintenance is a facet of gender parity and enabler of equality, not charity. It follows that a destitute Muslim woman has the right to seek maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC despite the enactment of the 1986 Act,"" she said.The court noted that Section 125 of CrPC was more beneficial to women in comparison to Section 3 of the 1986 law as maintenance to a divorced Muslim woman is given within the 'iddat' period by her husband under the 1986 law but under the secular provision, any divorced wife is entitled to maintenance till she remarries. Under personal law, maintenance for children is given by her former husband only for a period of two years but under Section 125, maintenance is given until the children attain the age of majority.","Supreme Court: Women, irrespective of their faith, were entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code.

It expressed commitment towards a robust examination system completely insulated from any malpractice.The apex court will hear the matter on Thursday.The court, while acknowledging that the leak and use of unfair means at a few centres in Patna and Gujarat had compromised the sanctity of the exams, had said it would order a retest if it was convinced that there was a systemic failure, and that the exams were vitiated to the extent that isolating the beneficiaries from untainted examinees would not be possible.Citing the verification done by IIT-M, Centre remained hewed to its stand that leaks and irregularities were limited and localised.On an unusually large number of students getting high scores in NEET-UG this year, the IIT report said, ""There is an overall increase in marks obtained by students, specifically in the range of 550 to 720. This is attributed to 25% reduction in syllabus. In addition, candidates obtaining such high marks are spread across multiple cities and centres, indicating very less likelihood of malpractice.""Centre said IIT-M drew the conclusions by analysing NEET-UG results data with the help of Python for data processing, PostgreSQL for data storage and Metabase for analysis after seeking several data facts from National Testing Agency.On counselling to be carried out based on NEET-UG results, Centre said, ""For any candidate, if it is found that s/he has been beneficiary of any malpractice, candidature of such person would be cancelled at any stage during the counselling process or even afterwards.""Responding to SC's query on steps being taken to make future NEET-UG and similar exams glitch and malpractice free, Centre said it has constituted a seven-member committee of experts chaired by Dr K Radhakrishnan, ex-chairman of Isro and chairman, board of governors, IIT Kanpur.""Confidentiality of question papers is the utmost priority in any examination and govt remains committed towards protecting interests of lakhs of students who have attempted the question papers fairly,"" it said and cited enactment of Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act by Parliament on Feb 12.","IIT-Madras conducted a comprehensive data analysis of the results of NEET-UG, which was marred by a question paper leak.

Both are residents of Hanle village in Ladakh. They had illegally brought in the gold from across China. It is possible that the suspects, both of whom can speak Hindi, carried the gold from Nepal and travelled to China by road before crossing the LAC on foot to enter Ladakh, said a source.When intercepted by the ITBP team patrolling the general area comprising Chismule, Narbula Top, Zakle and Zakla to check attempts at infiltration and smuggling, not unusual for the summer season, the duo started running in direction of the LAC. The ITBP party gave them a chase, intercepted them and took them to its camp for questioning.The duo initially said that they were out collecting medicinal plants but a search of their belongings by ITBP, authorised by the Union home ministry, led to the recovery of 108 one-kg gold bars, besides Chinese food items, two mobile phones, one binocular, knives, torch and hammer, among other things.ITBP Act provides the force powers of customs on the border to check smuggling.After reporting the matter to the higher ups, the ITBP patrol party handed over the seized items and the suspects to the customs department for questioning and action as per law. The two suspects have been arrested.Investigations are on into the origins of the journey undertaken by the two suspects, who are being jointly interrogated by the civil police, intelligence agencies, customs and ITBP.The source told TOI that 2-3 more persons, suspected to be Chamba and Targy’s aides, have been picked up for questioning. The smuggling racket could involve more people with the gold intended for delivery outside Ladakh.Officials did not rule out past involvement of the apprehended duo in similar smuggling episodes. “Usually, smuggling a gold consignment as huge as 108 kg is risked after multiple successful attempts involving smaller quantities of contraband,” said an officer.","ITBP: This is the largest ever haul of smuggled international gold in the history of ITBP.

Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw slams Congress over loco pilot work allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railway-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-slams-congress-over-loco-pilot-work-allegations/articleshow/111642633.cms,"NEW DELHI: Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday accused the Congress of trying to demoralise the “railway family” with “misinformation”. The minister’s response in a social media post detailing the work condition of loco pilots came after Congress’s offensive on the work conditions of train drivers following Rahul Gandhi met some of the pilots on Friday.Vaishnaw said loco pilots are important members of the railway family and that there was a lot of misinformation and theatrics by the opposition to demotivate them.In the detailed post, Vaishnaw said the duty hours of loco pilots are carefully monitored and the rest is provided meticulously after trips. “The average duty hours are maintained within prescribed hours. The average is less than 8 hours in June this year. Only under exigencies, the trip duration exceeds the prescribed hours,” he said.On the loco cabs, before 2014, they were in bad shape. The minister said in the past 10 years the cabs have been improved with ergonomic seats, and more than 7,000 of these are air-conditioned. New locomotives are manufactured with AC cabs.With regard to the off-duty resting facility, the minister said that when a pilot completes a trip, they come to the running room for rest if they are out of headquarters. He added that before 2014, running rooms were in bad shape and now almost all (558) running rooms are air-conditioned. The minister said that in running rooms, foot massagers are also provided. “Incidentally, this was criticised by Congress without understanding the working conditions of loco pilots,” he said.Meanwhile, R Kumaresan, president of All India Loco Running Staff Association (South Zone) said that they have been raising three demands — weekly rest should start after the loco pilots exhaust the period rest rest they get after every 8- hour trip, consecutive night duty limited to only two and return to headquarter within 48 hours. “We have not yet got any response to these issues,” he said.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said loco pilots are important members of the railway family.
