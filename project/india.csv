Courts have bolstered India's reputation for arbitration: Justice Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-have-bolstered-indias-reputation-for-arbitration-justice-kohli/articleshow/112237411.cms,"NEW DELHI: The courts in the country have bolstered India's reputation as a favourable destination for arbitration by upholding the sanctity of arbitral awards, Supreme Court judge Justice Hima Kohli has said. She was speaking at a seminar 'Recent Developments in Arbitration to Promote Business' organised by law firms Gibson Dunn Secretariat and UNUM Law, along with the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre (IAMC) and General Counsels' Association of India on Friday.Justice Kohli said the growth of international trade made dispute resolution more complex and to address the challenges, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), especially arbitration, had emerged as a powerful tool for businesses.""In recent years, India has made significant strides in establishing itself as a reliable partner in arbitration and mediation services. India's transformation into a commercial arbitration hub has been driven by the judiciary's unstinting commitment to fast-tracking matters under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and fostering a broadly pro-enforcement regime,"" said Justice Kohli.The apex court judge said various landmark judgments showed that India is committed to upholding the sanctity of arbitral awards.""By limiting judicial intervention and respecting arbitral awards, the effort of the Indian courts has bolstered India's reputation as a favourable destination for (alternative) dispute resolution. This judicial philosophy complements legislative reforms and signifies India's ambition to become a global hub for arbitration,"" she said.Justice Kohli underlined the need to foster a specialised arbitration bar, comprising experts and legal practitioners solely engaged in arbitration, because of the upsurge of institutional arbitration in the country.She said seminars and training sessions would streamline every facet of the arbitration process, from the drafting stage to enforcement of the award, besides boosting confidence in the country as an arbitration hub.""This would also ensure that arbitration gains traction and does not take a back seat compared to litigation in court,"" said the top court judge.Justice Kohli underscored that the recent amendments in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act aligned the laws with the best international practices and promoted a pro-arbitration regime that inspired confidence in the resolution of commercial disputes.""In 2021, the Act underwent further amendments. The 2021 amendment to the arbitration process is aimed at addressing new challenges and improving its effectiveness. These changes are directed towards promoting institutional arbitration, recognising the importance of specialised arbitration institutions, ensuring confidentiality during the proceedings and impartiality in the appointment of arbitrators,"" she said.Regarding the entry of foreign law firms in India in specific areas and on a reciprocal basis, which was permitted by the Bar Council of India in March 2023, Justice Kohli said it would provide the young talent with opportunities to compete with peers in the Western countries, besides enabling Indian law firms to adopt global best practices.""Additionally, these regulations will help address concerns about the influx of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and establish India as a hub for international commercial arbitration,"" she said.Justice Kohli said the country had the potential to establish itself as a preferred choice for international arbitration, particularly for commercial businesses.""It has a progressive legislative framework, a pro-enforcement judiciary and robust institutional support. Through its verdicts and administrative initiatives, the Indian judiciary has consistently demonstrated its commitment to ensuring the finality of the arbitral awards, encouraging mediation and fostering a pro-investment environment,"" she said.""Undoubtedly, India stands as a reservoir of untapped potential, poised to ascend as a premier destination for commercial mediation on the international level,"" she added.","Supreme Court judge Justice Hima Kohli said the growth of international trade made dispute resolution more complex.

SC bins PILs seeking probe into poll bond quid pro quo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bins-pils-seeking-probe-into-poll-bond-quid-pro-quo/articleshow/112236782.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday dismissed PILs seeking a retired SC judge-led SIT probe into allegations of award of contracts to certain corporate entities and termination of probes against others after they donated huge sums to governing political parties through electoral bonds which were held as unconstitutional by the SC on February 15.Refusing to order a roving inquiry into assumptive allegations of petitioners through advocates Prashant Bhushan, Vijay Hansaria and Pranav Sachdeva, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said the petitions were founded on the assumption that there could be an element of quid pro quo given the EB donations' proximity to award of contracts and change of pace of investigations.""Individual grievances of this nature with regard to the presence or absence of quid pro quo would have to be pursued on the basis of the remedies available under law. Likewise, where there is refusal to investigate or a closure report has been filed (on complaints relating to alleged EB quid pro quo), recourse can be taken to appropriate remedies under the law governing criminal procedure, or as the case may be under Article 226 (before high courts),"" the bench said.Bhushan even alleged that some officers of premier investigating agencies were suspected to have been involved in this quid pro quo exercise to force corporate houses to donate to political parties through EBs. ""At the present stage, absent a recourse to the remedies available under the law to pursue such grievances, it would be premature for this court to entertain the PILs,"" the bench said. ""The intervention of SC must be preceded by invocation of normal remedies under the law and contexted upon failure of these remedies. It would also be inappropriate because intervention of this court at this stage would postulate that the normal remedies which are available under the law would not be efficacious,"" it added.The SC said it had entertained challenges to the validity of statutory provisions embodying the EB scheme and consequential amendments to diverse statutes (Representation of the People Act, Companies Act and Income tax Act) because the power of judicial review to test validity of these changes was within its domain.Distinguishing between criminal wrongdoing allegations and constitutional validity challenges, the bench said the former were of a distinct nature where recourse to the SC's jurisdiction under Article 32 should not be taken as a matter of course, particularly when remedies were available under law. ""Moreover, the other reliefs which are sought in this batch of petitions, including a direction to the authorities to make recoveries from political parties on the basis that they (EB donations) are proceeds of crime and for that matter, the reopening of income tax assessments (of political parties from 2018) impinge upon statutory functions of authorities constituted under law to make inquiry in that regard,"" the bench said.Full report on www.toi.in","Supreme Court dismisses PILs seeking a retired SC judge-led SIT probe into allegations of award of contracts to certain corporate entities.

Poor start for India

PARIS: World Athletics (WA) president Sebastian Coe on Thursday lauded World and Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra for putting India in the elite company of 100 nations who have won a gold in athletics at the Olympic Games.""At Tokyo we had 22 member federations winning gold medals. And we now have 100 countries winning a gold medal in athletics. And that 100th was India, courtesy Neeraj Chopra with his outstanding effort in the men's javelin throw,"" Coe told reporters at a press conference as the blue-riband sport kicked off with the race walk competitions.There are 144 athletics medals up for grabs in 11 days.Asked about the prize money for the gold-medal winners, WA CEO Jon Ridgeon said: ""Our athletes deserve more as our income grows. I hope to extend that to all three medals at Los Angeles . It's the right thing to do. We are not the only one funding athletes; over 60% of NOCs have done that. I had conversations with many athletes from other sports. I think we made the right decision.""On the shoe technology taking the human element away more, Coe said: ""I think it's the evolution of technology. We talked to the athletes and coaches and we are not perfect with the regulations. We will continue to monitor that but if we get faster times at stadia we welcome that.""Coe, who won the 1500m gold in the Moscow Games in 1980 and Los Angeles four years later, said he was happy to see 1500m back in the spotlight.The WA president also said that it was a unanimous decision of the WA council to not allow athletes from Russia and Belarus. ""WA is not a political body and we made a tough decision on Russia and Belarus and that was done on the integrity of sport. There is a track and field team coming here and they have some very serious medal chances. It' a very constrained world that the athletes have to operate in. And was it fair for them to compete against athletes from a country who demonstrated such aggression.""Meanwhile, India's athletics campaign was off to a disappointing start in the men's and women's 20km race walk finals.

Rankireddy and Shetty, previously ranked number one globally, advanced as the leaders of Group C, setting up their encounter with Chia and Soh, who were the runners-up in Group A, trailing behind the world's top-ranked pair from China, Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang.The Malaysian team, which once dominated the head-to-head record against the Indian shuttlers with eight consecutive wins, has recently faced three consecutive defeats in their latest matchups.A victory in this quarterfinal would potentially pit the Indian pair against the tournament's top seeds, Liang and Wang, assuming the latter triumphs over the Indonesian team of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in their quarterfinal match.The competition between the Indian and Malaysian pairs has always been fiercely contested, with both sides aspiring to clinch their country's first badminton gold medal in the Olympics.The Malaysian pair is recognized for their strategic prowess, precision, and fast-paced gameplay. In contrast, Rankireddy and Shetty are known for their aggressive playing style, which they will need to employ effectively from the start to overcome their opponents.Having previously experienced several defeats against Chia and Soh, the Indian pair managed to secure their first victory against the Malaysians at the Indonesia Open Super 1000 final in the previous year, followed by wins at the 2022 Asian Games individual event and the India Open.Elsewhere in the tournament, the second half of the draw features a match between the second-seeded Danish pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Rasmussen and the fourth-seeded Korean team of Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Seung Jae.Furthermore, Thailand's Supak Jomkoh and Kedren Kittinupong will compete against the Tokyo Olympic gold medallists Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin from Chinese Taipei, promising a series of compelling matches in the men's doubles category.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty to face Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in quarterfinals.

The month of August marks a period of heightened involvement in academic and extracurricular activities for both school and college students. With the commencement of the new school year or semester in the previous month following summer vacations, students are deeply immersed in their studies and regular class attendance.August is also notable for several culturally significant holidays that are important to students and other stakeholders.Unlike July, which had almost no holidays, August 2024 offers students multiple school holidays, providing opportunities for relaxation amidst their ongoing classes and school activities.Schools across India will observe holidays for Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi, and Krishna Janmashtami. Additionally, in the middle of the month, India will celebrate its 77th Independence Day, a national holiday during which schools, colleges, and other institutions will be closed.Overall in the month of August 2024, there are a total of nine school holidays, including Saturdays and Sundays. Here's the complete list-Independence Day commemorates India's liberation from British colonial rule in 1947. It's a national holiday marked by patriotic fervor, parades, and celebrations, honoring the sacrifices of freedom fighters.Raksha Bandhan is a cherished festival celebrating the unbreakable bond between siblings. Sisters tie a sacred thread (rakhi) on their brother's wrist, symbolizing protection and love. In return, brothers pledge to protect their sisters.Janmashtami is a joyous occasion dedicated to the birth of Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Devotees observe fasts, decorate homes, and participate in midnight prayers and celebrations. It's a time for spiritual reflection and devotion.In addition to the scheduled holidays in August, there are several important observances, such as awareness days, the birth anniversaries of prominent figures, and other significant events.

"Paris Olympics: Two in the bag, super Manu Bhaker not done yet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-two-in-the-bag-super-manu-bhaker-not-done-yet/articleshow/112153753.cms,"Shooting star 1st Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic

CHATEAUROUX: ""No time to celebrate. My work is unfinished. There's a lot to play for,"" Manu Bhaker had said after winning her first Olympic medal on Sunday. There indeed was a lot more at stake. There was a date with history too. The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games. Bhaker wins bronze in 10m air pistol mixed team event. She is the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Games.

How did the children drown? You have done an investigation now. We are on August 2. Why were they not able to come out of the basement? the bench demanded to know. ""It doesn't get flooded immediately. Water takes at least 2-3 minutes to fill a basement, it can't happen in a minute.""Pulling up the force for not questioning MCD officials, the bench told senior advocate Sanjay Jain, representing Delhi Police, ""No disrespect, but we don't think your police are equipped to handle this case.""Why didn’t you go to the MCD office and seize the file? Will you wait till the file gets changed and evidence lost? Are you a police force or you will wait to file an RTI query for answers?

Which are the MCD officials you have interrogated? These are very glaring omissions in the police probe. Any common man would ask these questions,” it said.HC took a dim view of the police’s act of arresting an SUV driver and blaming him for the incident and caustically observed, “Mercifully, you have not challaned the rainwater for entering the basement. You would have said how dare the water enter the basement. You could have fined the water also, the way you arrested the SUV driver for driving his car there.”On being informed by the MCD commissioner, who was present in the court, that the stormwater drains in the area were dysfunctional, the bench asked why the officials did not inform the MCD chief about it and ordered immediate removal of encroachments and unauthorised constructions, including on stormwater and sewage drains, in Rajender Nagar.HC pointed out that police could arrest a passerby but hadn’t interrogated the municipal official who did not see that the stormwater drain was dysfunctional. “First of all, your police officers, we have called them here for one purpose... (to tell them) Police is respected when it books the culprit and leaves the innocent.It rapped the MCD for not adhering to judicial orders and said its officials were not bothered and there is no respect for the law.

Centre notifies 6th draft on Western Ghats eco zone as states refuse to play ball,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-notifies-6th-draft-on-western-ghats-eco-zone-as-states-refuse-to-play-ball/articleshow/112233057.cms,"Farming won’t be affected, says Western Ghats eco zone draft

NEW DELHI: Three days after the massive landslides in Kerala 's Wayanad district, Centre on Friday released a sixth draft notification proposing earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ecologically sensitive area (ESA) to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats , spread over six states.The draft for the first time has a provision enabling the final ESA notification to be taken up ""in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification"" - a move that may hasten the process without waiting for all six states to be on board at the same time.The states haven't been keen on the proposal.Within the proposed ESA is 9,993 sq km in Kerala, which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district, including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30.Earmarking of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) in Western Ghats, on which Centre issues a sixth draft on Friday, was pending since August 2011, when a central panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, recommended that the government take it up on priority to save the fragile terrain in six states.Environment ministry that notified the sixth draft in official gazette days after the Wayanad tragedy on Wednesday, said the proposal will be “taken into consideration” for publishing the final notification of ESA on or after expiry of a period of 60 days from the date on which copies of the gazette are made available to the public.The ministry sought “objections or suggestions” on the proposals in the draft. Except for provision of notification in a “phased manner”, the sixth draft broadly replicates the fifth one, issued in July 2022, whose validity expired on June 30.Accordingly, it proposed ESA of 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, and recommended prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed a complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up of any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after the final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting industries. The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdictions in Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014, but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry issued 4 more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 & 2022.Centre and an expert panel discussed fifth draft with Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, nine times during July 2022-March 2024 but could not finalise ESA notification due to objections from states — initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa, and later from Karnataka. The then Karnataka govt even requested Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect livelihood of people.The draft clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","The draft for the first time has a provision enabling the final ESA notification to be taken up ""in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification"" The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdictions in Western Ghats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112233128,imgsize-1544822,width-400,resizemode-4/112233128.jpg"

Review

aims to ensure law is working in practice

NEW DELHI: Stepping beyond constitutional courts ' traditional role limited to testing the constitutionality of legislations and validity of executive decisions and taking on oversight functions, Supreme Court has ruled that it can direct a performance audit of legislations to identify and address infirmities in their implementation on the ground.This ruling came from a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Arvind Kumar, who asked the Bombay HC chief justice to constitute a special bench for a performance audit of Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, which has, over the years, been in the eye of litigation in HC and even in SC.Justice Narasimha said, ""Assessment of the working of the statute to realise if its purpose and objective has been achieved or not is the implied duty of the executive government.""Justice P S Narasimha said, “Reviewing implementation… is an integral part of rule of law. It is in recognition of this obligation of the executive govt that constitutional courts have directed govts to carry out a performance audit...”The purpose of review is to ensure a law is working in practice as it was intended and if it’s not, then to understand why and address it quickly, bench said, while pointing to another reason for such performance audits.“A peculiar feature of how our legislative system works is that an overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced and carried through by govt, with few private member bills being introduced and debated. In such circumstances, judicial role does encompass, in this court’s understanding, the power, nay the duty, to direct the executive branch to review the working ofstatutes and audit the statutory impact,” the bench said.However, SC clarified that before a constitutional court orders performance audit of a legislation, it must assess the litigation history of the operation of the law to arrive at a finding that “statutory schemes and procedures (under that legislation) are gridlocked in bureaucratic or judicial quagmires that impede or delay statutory objectives”.“One can only state that this direction must be predicated on a finding that the statute has, through demonstrable judicial data or other cogent material, failed to ameliorate the conditions of the beneficiaries.”","Supreme Court has ruled that it can direct a performance audit of legislations.

Kerala CM Vijayan counters Shah



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Friday moved a privilege motion against Union home minister Amit Shah for his ""gave prior warning to Kerala"" remark in Rajya Sabha on Wayanad landslides . The Centre, however, jumped in to defend the remark.Accusing Amit Shah of ""misleading the Rajya Sabha"", the Congress MP in the letter to the chairman said, ""In his response to a Calling Attention on the Wayanad landslides in the Rajya Sabha on July 31, 2024, the Union Home Minister made several claims on early warning systems and how they were not utilized by the Kerala government in spite of alerts issued by the Union Government well ahead of the tragedy.These claims have been extensively fact-checked in the media.""""It is clear that the Union Home Minister misled the Rajya Sabha by his emphatic statements on early warnings issued by the Union government which have been proven to be false. It is well established that misleading the House by a Minister or a Member constitutes a breach of privilege and contempt of the House,"" the Congress MP wrote.""Under these circumstances, we submit that privilege proceedings may be initiated against the Union Home Minister in this matter,"" the letter read.Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, meanwhile, provided ""additional facts"" to both Houses of the Parliament on the Wayanad landslide incident with ""fact copies of India Meteorological Department's early alerts issued from July 23 to July 29"".The facts mentioned that such heavy rainfall, in hilly areas like Wayanad, could also lead to other rainfall-induced disasters, such as landslides.""As per the National Policy on Disaster Management, the primary responsibility for disaster management, adequate preparedness measures, rests with the State Governments concerned,"" mentioned the additional facts furnished in both the Houses of the Parliament.""In its daily heavy rainfall warning issued by IMD five days before the occurrence of the sad event, it predicted continuously the occurrence of heavy to very heavy rainfall over Kerala during 0830 IST of 29th to 0830 IST of 30th July 2024 based on 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th. On 29th midday IMD issued an Orange colour warning with prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall (upto 20 cm) valid upto 0830 IST of 30th July. IMD issued impact based forecast in colour codes and suggested actions alongwith the heavy rainfall warning. The impact based forecast included possibility of landslide and localized inundation and damage to vulnerable structures,"" it said.Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday blamed the Kerala government for its delayed response to early warning systems regarding potential landslides in state, attributing the major losses to their lack of prompt action. Shah highlighted that on July 23, nine teams from the National Disaster Response Force were dispatched to Kerala following the early warning.""""An early warning was given to Kerala govt on July 23 and again on July 24. Earlier, several states, including Odisha and Gujarat used the Centre's early warning system to limit damages,"" he said in Rajya Sabha.""Under this early warning system, on July 23, at my direction, 9 NDRF teams were sent to Kerala considering that there could be landslides... What did the Kerala government do? Were the people shifted? And if they were shifted then how did they die?"" he asked.""Wayanad losses could have been minimised had Kerala govt become alert following arrival of NDRF teams,"" he said.Over 300 people have lost their lives in the deadly landslides as rescue operations continue.In response to Amit Shah's remark, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan hit out at Centre, saying it was not the time for blame game.Kerala CM further stated that the media provides accurate warnings and that weather notifications are always taken seriously in the state.""Media provides accurate warnings, and weather alerts are always taken seriously in the state. This is not the time for mutual accusations. The facts are clear to everyone. An orange alert was in place in the area where the disaster occurred. In the first 24 hours, 200 millimetres of rain fell. In the next 24 hours, 372 millimetres of rain fell. A total of 572 millimetres of rain was recorded over 48 hours exceeding the warning levels,"" the CM said.Vijayan also highlighted that no red alert was issued for the area prior to the disaster. ""A red alert was only issued at 6 am on the day of the disaster. The red alert was issued only after the landslide occurred. The severe weather warning and red alert were given on the morning of July 30, after the landslide.

ED plans to raid me: Rahul. Bid to hide Wayanad inaction: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-plans-to-raid-me-rahul-bid-to-hide-wayanad-inaction-bjp/articleshow/112233880.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Friday claimed the Centre was planning an Enforcement Directorate raid on him because it was angry with his "" chakravyuh "" comment, a claim which triggered day-long speculation and commentary besides leading BJP to jibe that the leader of opposition's charge was a gimmick aimed at distracting attention from the criticism he is facing over the Wayanad tragedy .Rahul wrote on X, ""Apparently, 2 in 1 didn't like my chakravyuh speech. ED 'insiders' tell me a raid is being planned. Waiting with open arms, director, ED... chai and biscuits on me.""The ""2 in 1"" was widely viewed as a reference to PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. Rahul, who is on bail in a money laundering case related to the National Herald scam, had used the ""chakravyuh"" metaphor in a scathing attack on the Modi govt and BJP during a speech on Budget on Monday.BJP's response was swift and hard-hitting. Former Union minister Anurag Thakur said Rahul's ""wild claim"" was a gimmick and accused the Congress MP of glossing over the fact that he is on bail in the National Herald case, with the court rejecting his claim of innocence after examining evidence. ""By claiming to have been tipped off by ED insiders, he has reduced himself to be a clone of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who was notorious for trying similar PR gimmicks. He should pause and see what happened to Kejriwal's credibility,"" he said.Thakur's colleague, former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, charged Rahul with raising an ""imaginary issue"" to avoid questions related to Wayanad. ""Rahul Gandhi might have been told that people are asking questions about his accountability so he has sought to create a new narrative. The local MP is the last person to reach there,"" he told reporters.Immediately after Rahul's tweet, Congress whip in Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion on ""BJP govt's misuse of agencies like ED, CBI, and income tax department for political harassment"". The notice said despite BJP's reduced numbers from 303 to 240 seats and its reliance on TDP and JDU, the govt was not giving up on its policy of using agencies for ""political intimidation"".BJP also fired volleys through the day. ""As MP of Wayanad for five years, you (Rahul) did nothing to save the people from potential landslides. In Feb 2023, Isro placed Wayanad at 13th place in a list of 147 districts on the Landslide Atlas of India. It still didn't move you. Now, don't shed crocodile tears,"" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said on X.The saffron party also shared a video of Rahul's visit to Wayanad where he was stopped by locals who said, ""Brother, ask him to stop the car. We are the people who voted for him and made him win... He was the MP of this place. If he is so concerned about not getting out of the car and dirtying his feet in the mud, why has he come here? What is there to see here?""""Angry protestors accost third time fail Rahul Gandhi on his visit to Wayanad,"" Malviya said in another post.Congress was tight-lipped about the possible provocation behind Rahul's claim, with MP Shashi Tharoor saying the leader of opposition must have got some information which prompted him to put out the social media post. ""He keeps saying 'daro mat'. He is not worried,"" the Kerala MP said.","Rahul wrote on X, ""Apparently, 2 in 1 didn't like my chakravyuh speech. ED 'insiders' tell me a raid is being planned.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of Supreme Court recommending stricter procedures for verifying candidate identities for examinations, a recent case has come to light where an alert technical organisation under central govt averted a dozen possible impersonators from joining after they had been selected by a government recruitment agency .In some cases, major discrepancies were detected in their documents and in several cases photographs of the candidates in the files sent by the recruitment entity did not match with their actual physical appearance.Officials said the ""successful"" candidates were selected for appointment as multi-tasking staff (technical). ""When their credentials were checked, officials detected discrepancies, such as mismatch of handwriting . A committee was then set up to verify all details and their joining was put on hold till the process was complete,"" said a source.""Subsequently, when we sent communications to authenticate the credentials, none of them turned up. So, the process of joining couldn't be completed,"" added the source.As per sources, during first stage of verification , some of the candidates who were confronted with mismatch with photographs in the files came up with strange excuses of how they had long hair and gained weight just before the exam. Their claims were not convincing and there was a possibility that someone else appeared for the candidate in the test.The organisation has sent the dossiers of the candidates to the recruitment agency for necessary action.Talking to TOI, senior govt officials said proper checking of details and other credentials of candidates at the time of joining any organisation can prevent people coming to the system using unfair means. “Exam centres should have CCTV cameras & recruitment agencies must use good cameras (at least 6 MP) and click colour photographs for more clarity. Best way to prevent any such fraud is to go for biometric attendance at the time of exam so that their authenticity can be verified when they join any office,” an official said.","Officials said the ""successful"" candidates were selected for appointment as multi-tasking staff (technical) When credentials were checked, officials detected discrepancies, such as mismatch of handwriting.

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Friday brought closure to the controversy over NEET UG- 2024 by holding that there was no systemic failure in this year's exam for admission to medical colleges across the country and that the paper leak was limited to centres in Hazaribag and Patna. This brings finality to the results and ranks of the test.Besides, it expanded the remit of the Centre-appointed panel headed by Isro ex-chairman K Radhakrishnan to enable it to recommend measures to ensure security, sanctity and integrity of pan-India exams.It asked for the report be submitted by Sept 30. The SC criticised National Testing Agency for its laxity and flip-flops. ""By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, such a panel will help restore trust in the exam system and implement robust safeguards,"" it said.Pronouncing a 63-page judgment detailing reasons for its refusal on July 23 to cancel NEET-UG, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, such a committee will help restore trust in the examination system and implement robust safeguards to prevent future malpractice.” It faulted NTA for failing to communicate in time to designated banks for release of a particular set of question papers, resulting in candidates getting a wrong set.“A body such as NTA, which is entrusted with immense responsibility in relation to highly important competitive exams, cannot afford to misstep, take an incorrect decision and amend it at a later stage. All decisions must be well considered, with due regard to the importance of the decision. Flip-flops are an anathema to fairness,” the CJI said.Though the bench spared 23.3 lakh students having to take NEET-UG afresh, as demanded by petitioners, it faulted NTA for failing to communicate in time to designated banks for release of a particular set of question papers, resulting in candidates getting a wrong set.The apex court also held NTA responsible for awarding full marks for two options to an atomic theory question when it was clear that only one of the options was correct, as was later reaffirmed by IIT-Delhi. Further, it criticised NTA’s decision to award grace marks resulting in over 60 candidates scoring perfect 720/720 marks.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said the Radhakrishnan committee must evaluate and recommend reforms in the mechanism of administration of exams, which must include rigorous checks and balances at every stage, from setting question papers to declaring results. It extended the panel’s tenure from Aug 22 to Sept 30, by when it must submit its recommendations to education ministry.SC said the Dharmendra Pradhan-headed ministry shall take a decision on the committee’s recommendations within a month of receiving the report.The bench said the committee would also formulate SOPs which set out the timelines for registration, changes to preferred cities, sealing of OMR sheets once candidates submit them to the invigilator, and other processes related to conduct of the exam. “Once adopted by NTA, the SOPs must be adhered to, to maintain the integrity of the exam,” it said.","Supreme Court: No systemic failure in this year's exam for admission to medical colleges. Paper leak was limited to centres in Hazaribag and Patna. Centre- appointed panel to recommend measures to ensure security, sanctity and integrity of pan-India exams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112233231,imgsize-635465,width-400,resizemode-4/112233231.jpg"
"Mamata Banerjee urges Sitharaman to review 'anti-people' taxation policies, withdraw GST on insurance premium",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mamata-banerjee-urges-sitharaman-to-review-anti-people-taxation-policies-withdraw-gst-on-insurance-premium/articleshow/112231488.cms,"Calling tax on essential items 'anti-people,' West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged the central government to remove the goods and services tax ( GST ) on life insurance and health insurance premiums.In a letter, addressed to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , Banerjee emphasized that the tx on essential items increases the financial burden on ordinary citizens.Currently, both life insurance and medical insurance premiums are subject to a GST rate of 18 per cent. Banerjee expressed concern that this additional 18 per cent GST burden might discourage many people from purchasing new policies or maintaining their existing insurance coverage, potentially exposing them to unexpected financial hardships.""The primary objective of life and health insurance is to provide financial security and support during unexpected times such as illness, accidents, and untimely deaths. These policies play a crucial role in ensuring that individuals and their families can cope with financial hardships during such challenging times,"" her letter read.Furthermore, Banerjee contended that insurance is an essential element of the social safety net, alleviating the government's responsibility to provide direct financial support to citizens during health crises. She also requested that the central government include provisions for standard deductions under sections 80C and 80D of the Income Tax Act within the new tax regime, which are currently available under the old tax regime.""We all know that health is wealth. Healthcare is a major social security, and it is our commitment to extend to the common people maximum social security in this area to ensure their good health and well-being,"" the letter further read.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has urged the central government to remove the goods and services tax ( GST ) on life insurance and health insurance premiums.

"1,500 estate workers stare at uncertainty as Manjolai estates return to woods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1500-estate-workers-stare-at-uncertainty-as-manjolai-estates-return-to-woods/articleshow/112231416.cms,"Set deep in the dense woods of Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in Tirunelveli district, Manjolai is a breathtaking hill station. It is also home to 2,500 people, including estate workers, who have been living here for generations. But of late, this small community of estate workers have been losing sleep. The town, which comes under the reserve forest category, is about to be handed back to the government following the end of a 99-year lease on the land.This means all the workers will be deprived of a livelihood.The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd (BBTCL) leased 8,374 acres of land from the then Singampatti Zamindar on Feb 12, 1929. The land was developed to grow cash crops, including tea, coffee, cardamom and pepper for which labourers were brought from Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and neighbouring Kerala. Nestled in the scenic setting, Manjolai, Kakkachi, Nalumukku, Oothu and Kuthiraivetti are all wards in the BBTCL estate.As time went by, workers got houses, civil supplies shops, high schools, govt-aided elementary schools as well as hospital creches and a guesthouse, which belonged to the factory. Temples, churches and mosques were also constructed, besides a biodiversity museum and a conservation centre for lion-tailed macaques.On Feb 28, 2018, the first bombshell dropped, with Tamil Nadu govt declaring the 23,000 acres of land, including the 8,374 acres of the Manjolai estate, as reserve forest. With the courts striking down the BBTCL’s request to grant pattas for the land, it has to hand back the land to the govt by 2028, after bringing down all the buildings within the forest.There are about 3,000 voters in the estate, a majority of whom are dalits, belonging to the scheduled caste community. The workers say caste is not a major factor here, and that they live in harmony, celebrating festivals together.Robert Chandra Kumar was among the first of the youngsters to leave the village for higher studies and is a practising advocate at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. “We have lived here (Manjolai) for five generations, and though my parents have told me about the birthplaces of my grandparents (elsewhere in Tirunelveli district), I have no connection to my ancestral villages,” he says.The BBTCL has offered voluntary retirement to its workers for pensions ranging from 1.45lakh to 3lakh, but if the workers reach 60 years of age, they are not eligible for any compensation, says Robert. “A few lakhs of rupees mean a lot to these workers as their daily wage is 450.”Ward councillor S Stalin says the people know no other livelihood. “They have lived in the cool climate of Manjolai for nearly 95 years. Living in warmer climes in the plains could prove detrimental to them.”For the youngsters who have now completed their higher education and moved to cities, the tea estates provide nostalgia, not a livelihood. But for the older generation, it is their bread and butter. “Who will be willing to welcome or take care of those above 70? How can people like them start a new life in the plains?” asks John Kennady, a worker from Nalumukku.M Jayashree, 46, a tea factory worker, says she has worked as a permanent employee for 16 years, and has 13 more years of service. “They are asking us to find employment elsewhere but where will we go? Manjolai is our mainstay, our identity, what job will a tea factory worker like me get?” she asks. Jayashree adds that many of her co-workers have started losing sleep as they don’t have any other roots, don’t own houses, and have children to fend for. “What can one do with 3 lakhs?’ she asks.The residents have just one request to the government - to allow these estates to remain undisturbed and bring Manjolai under the Tamilnadu Tea Plantation Corporation Limited ( Tantea ), like it did with the estates in Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts to protect the resettled Sri Lankan tea estate workers .“We don’t claim rights to the land, we just want it protected,” they say. “Unlike tea estates, where the estate owners have started promoting tourism, Manjolai remains unspoilt. It is a well-preserved ecosystem, which can remain so, if real estate does not ruin it,” says Robert.The workers have been the guardians of the forest for nearly a century, and almost all the trees have been protected, Robert adds. “Some of Tamil Nadu’s oldest trees in the area are in the Manjolai estate. Unlike other estate regions like Valparai, no major incidents of man-animal conflict have been reported here.”The only untoward incident occurred on July 23, 1999, when hundreds of workers marched towards the Tirunelveli collectorate demanding higher wages from the meagre 70 that they were receiving. Police lathi-charged the protesting workers and as the crowds ran helter-skelter, 17 workers drowned in the Thamirabarani river that flows through the district in the plains.Some of the female workers say that all the political parties had campaigned in their region during the Lok Sabha elections, but did not comment on their livelihood. “We still believe that the govt should at least keep the company running. The future of our children studying in Class X at the Manjolai high school remains uncertain,” they say.When contacted, Tirunelveli district collector K P Karthikeyan said they were waiting for the workers and the factory administration to come to a consensus. “I have spoken to them. The sub collector of Cheranmadevi and joint commissioner for labour are also in regular contact with the labourers,” he said. The estate administration is said to be offering alternative employment to workers in some of their other estates in Tamil Nadu, including in Valparai and Ooty in addition to the VRS offer. “As the model code of conduct is in effect we cannot make any major decision, and it will be decided after the workers and their employer agree on something,” said Karthikeyan.“The government will take its decision based on the outcome of the talks.” A meeting between the factory administration and workers scheduled on May 18, was called off.","Manjolai, in Tirunelveli district, is home to 2,500 people, including estate workers.

"INDIA bloc likely to demand withdrawal of 18% GST on life, medical insurance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-likely-to-demand-withdrawal-of-18-gst-on-life-medical-insurance/articleshow/112231300.cms,"NEW DELHI: The INDIA parties are likely to take up the demand for withdrawal of 18% GST on life and medical insurance premiums in a big way.The demand, first raised by opposition Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) in Rajya Sabha on July 29, saw the party leading a walkout from over it on Friday, with INDIA bloc partner DMK joining the protest by walking out and Shiv Sena (UBT) member joining the chorus for roll back in Lok Sabha.The issue that affects middle class across the country, could snowball into a big issue against the government, with opposition parties threatening to take it up in the streets if the government fails to roll back the tax of insurance premiums.Interestingly, the issue initiated by the opposition, got a new dimension when road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari wrote to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 31, urging her to consider withdrawing the tax on insurance premiums or “uncertainties of life,” as he put it, two days after TMC MP Saket Gokhale raised it in Rajya Sabha.A day after Gadkari’s letter, West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee threatened to take to the streets if the government did not roll back the GST on insurance premiums. “Our demand to Government of India is to roll back GST from life and medical insurance premium on the grounds of people’s health imperatives. This GST is bad because it adversely affects the people’s ability to take care of their basic vital needs. If the Government of India does not roll back the anti-people GST, we will be bound to hit the roads,” Banerjee posted on X on Thursday.On Friday she also wrote a letter to Sitharaman, expressing “deep anguish” while highlighting how the GST on insurance premiums “increases the financial burden on the common man.”On Friday, TMC leader in Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, urged the government to withdraw the GST on life and medical insurance premiums. Soon after Question Hour in the lower House, Bandyopadhyay raised the issue, saying “the 18 % GST charged over life insurance premiums and medical insurance should be withdrawn. This GST is anti-people, it is adversely affecting the people of India,"" with several INDIA bloc members -- DMK and Shiv Sena -- backing him in Lok Sabha. TMC MP Sharmila Sarkar also spoke on the same lines.While TMC and DMK walked out, alleging that there was no clarification from the government on the issue, Sena (UBT) MP Rajabhau Waje also demanded rol back of GST from insurance premiums.Gadkari’s letter to the FM said, ""Levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life. The (LIC, Nagpur) Union feels that the person who covers the risk of life's uncertainties to give some protection to the family should not be levied tax on the premium to purchase cover against this risk. Similarly, the 18% GST on medical insurance premium is proving to be a deterrent for the growth of this segment of business which is socially necessary.""","The demand, first raised by opposition Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) in Rajya Sabha on July 29, saw the party leading a walkout from over it on Friday. INDIA bloc partner DMK joined the protest by walking out and Shiv Sena (UBT) member joined the chorus for roll back in Lok Sabha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112231312,imgsize-1284718,width-400,resizemode-4/112231312.jpg"
