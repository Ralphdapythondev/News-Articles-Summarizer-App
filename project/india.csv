"Poll Outcome: Haryana farmers move on, leaving protest issues behind",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poll-outcome-haryana-farmers-move-on-leaving-protest-issues-behind/articleshow/114103068.cms,"Farmer's protest

NEW DELHI: The farmer protests , billed as the catalyst behind AAP’s win in Punjab, failed to yield similar output for Congress in Haryana where even a prominent farm agitation leader Gurnam Singh Charuni , who could garner only 1,170 votes, lost his deposit from Pehoba assembly seat.While state agriculture minister Kanwar Pal was among the eight ministerial casualties despite BJP surprising even pollsters, after western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana poll outcome indicates that farmers haven’t rejected government's farm policies.Though the Congress candidate Mandeep Chatha won from the Pehoba seat defeating his BJP rival by over 6500 votes, Charuni’s performance shows the year-long agitation during 2020-21 was a thing of the past in Haryana. The farmers seem to have moved on after the government repealed the three farm laws — the key demand of protesters — without being carried away by the change of goalpost by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) that spearheaded the agitation.Legal guarantee on procurement of all crops at minimum support price (MSP) became the key demand of SKM, something that Congress promised to implement if voted to power after a decade in opposition. But with the BJP government in the state offering MSP for crops other than wheat and paddy, the pre-poll proposal in the manifesto had less appeal as procurement during the last season broke previous records.Besides, Haryana farmers have diversified enough towards horticulture crops — non-MSP produce — to become less dependent on government-assisted procurement unlike Punjab where much larger sown area under paddy and wheat makes the state more dependent on the government’s intervention.Haryana is also more industrialised than Punjab through industrial clusters in several parts of the state as well as rice mills, offering people employment opportunities that go beyond tilling farms. Faridabad, Panipat, Kurukshetra, Hissar and Gurgaon-Manesar belt absorb a large number of workers unlike Punjab where industrialists have fled the state due to high power tariffs, poor policies as well as safety concerns in recent months.BJP’s victory in Haryana may, however, see continuation of deadlock between government and protesting farmers as the latter continue to press for legal guarantee to MSP. Although no fresh agitation is expected in the state, protesting farmers may continue the blockade at Shambhu Border along Punjab-Haryana unless the Supreme Court steps in to resolve the crisis by ordering removal of protesters from the current site.",The farmer protests failed to yield similar output for Congress in Haryana.

WWF: The way Indians eat is best for Earth: WWF Living Planet Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-way-indians-eat-is-best-for-earth-wwf-living-planet-report/articleshow/114102748.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: WWF ’s Living Planet Report , released on Thursday, calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies ( G20 countries ), noting that it would be least climate-damaging for Earth to support food production by 2050 if all countries adopt India’s pattern. Argentina, Australia and USA are worst on this count.“If everyone in the world adopted the current food consumption patterns of the world’s major economies by 2050, we exceed the 1.5° Celsius climate (warming limit) target for food related greenhouse gas emissions by 263 per cent and require one to seven Earths to support us,” the report says, making special mention of India’s millet mission .The report points out that if all countries adopt the current consumption patterns of India, the world would need ‘less than one earth’ (0.84) by 2050 to support food production. The Indian scenario is even marginally better than the planetary climate boundary for food, indicating the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that food systems can emit to stay within 1.5° Celsius of the warming limit.In contrast, the world will need the highest 7.4 Earths if it adopts the consumption patterns of Argentina. It means Argentina has the worst system on a sustainable benchmark, followed by Australia (6.8), USA (5.5), Brazil (5.2), France (5), Italy (4.6), Canada (4.5) and the UK (3.9). Among the better ones, Indonesia (0.9) figures only after India (0.84) and ahead of China (1.7), Japan (1.8) and Saudi Arabia (2).The report also appreciated India’s ongoing efforts to promote climate-resilient millets ( nutri-cereals ), saying National Millet Campaign is designed to increase national consumption of this ancient grain which is good for health and highly resilient in the face of climate change .“Eating more sustainable diets would reduce the amount of land needed to produce food: grazing land, in particular, could be freed up for other purposes, including nature restoration and carbon sequestration,” says the report. It also underlines the importance of promoting healthy alternative protein sources such as legumes and nutri-cereals, plant-based meat alternatives, and algal species high in nutritional value.","WWF Living Planet Report calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies.

"India has seen mixed results for species trends, bird populations in open habitats have declined",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-seen-mixed-results-for-species-trends-bird-populations-in-open-habitats-have-declined/articleshow/114101893.cms,"India has seen mixed results for species trends, bird populations in open habitats have declined

What’s the main takeaway for India in terms of vulnerability, decline in number of species (specific examples), habitat loss and efforts, whatsoever, to restore/conserve the country’s natural ecosystem?

Do you think those efforts are enough?

What more can be done?

NEW DELHI: With the WWF ’s Living Planet Report 2024 highlighting catastrophic 73% decline in average size of wildlife populations in just 50 years, the TOI on Thursday sought to find out its main takeaway for India. Dipankar Ghose, Director-Biodiversity Conservation, WWF-India, responded to key questions on India and its efforts, whatsoever, to conserve the country’s wildlife populations.Excerpts:India has seen mixed results for species trends. Tiger populations have increased in the country over the last one and half decades, with a mean population estimate of 3682 individuals as per the last count. However, the situation is the opposite for bird populations. Birds in open habitats have declined. In India, scientists developed fine-tuned SDMs (Species Distribution Models) and predicted 1091 terrestrial bird species that would be distributed in the country by 2070 on two climatic surfaces using Maximum Entropy-based species distribution algorithms. Of these bird species, approximately 66-73% species in the country will shift to higher elevations or shift northwards. Another 58% bird species would lose part of their distribution ranges, whereas that of about 40% bird species would increase.Bird species richness is expected to change extensively in both Western and Eastern Himalayas. An overall decrease in the congregation or flock size of birds has also been observed. The State of India’s Birds (2023) assessed data 942 bird species from 30 million observations and reported a 39% decline of species over the past decades. The same report also classified 178 species as of High Conservation Priority. Vultures have seen a major decline between 2002 and 2022, and the latest survey of vultures across India has seen a reduction in populations of the white-rumped vulture by 67%, the Indian vulture by 48% and the slender-billed vulture by 89%. These declines are attributed to use of NSAIDs like acelofenac and ketoprofen.It is important to conserve bird habitats, in urban, peri-urban and natural ecosystems – they are the indicators of major ecosystem health. Even for tigers, while numbers have increased, habitats have declined. The last All India Tiger Estimation Report (NTCA, 2022) stated that 254,880 sq.km of tiger habitat was found to have invasive species at varying magnitudes across the country. Overall, while India has done well to conserve several key wildlife species and, in fact, holds the world’s largest populations of species like the Bengal tiger, greater one-horned rhino and Asiatic elephant as well as a significant population of aquatic species such as the river dolphin and gharial. At the same time, species like the Great Indian Bustard are on the brink of extinction.India has done well in the recovery of endangered species like the greater one-horned rhinoceros, that saw concerted action from the government, scientists and civil society organisations, backed by tremendous support from people. There was a multi-pronged approach, on protection, habitat restoration and management and species recovery through active management. Such efforts are needed for restoring populations of other Critically Endangered and Endangered species. Along with efforts of the government, industries, institutions and CSOs will need to join hands for species-specific restoration efforts.Long-term conservation of wildlife and ecosystems in India requires a holistic, science-based and inclusive approach that integrates well-managed and connected ecosystems and effective species conservation strategies that are implemented in collaboration and with the support of local communities. With new threats like climate change emerging, ecosystem-based adaptation helps in managing climate change impacts, by increasing ecosystem & community resilience. Specific actions include restoration of wetlands and mangroves. OECMs (Other Effective Area Based Conservation Measures) that support conservation in areas outside formally protected areas with the engagement of communities, businesses and individuals are also a way forward in protecting nature.","India has seen mixed results for species trends, bird populations in open habitats have declined.

"Wildlife Populations: Monitored wildlife populations plummeted 73% in just 50 yrs, says WWF report; experts highlight alarming vulture losses in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monitored-wildlife-populations-plummeted-73-in-just-50-yrs-says-wwf-report-experts-highlight-alarming-vulture-losses-in-india/articleshow/114101671.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: X)

NEW DELHI: There has been a steep 73 per cent decline globally in the average size of ‘monitored wildlife populations ’ in just 50 years (1970-2020), said the WWF ’s Living Planet Report-2024 with experts underlining an alarming decline in the population of three vulture species in India between 1992 and 2002.The report, carrying the Zoological Society of London’s Living Planet Index (LPI), noted strongest decline in freshwater populations (85 per cent) followed by terrestrial (69 per cent) and marine populations (56 per cent) among the 34,836 monitored wildlife populations of 5,495 vertebrate species of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles.The report, released on Thursday, also highlights how the ecological degradation and habitat loss , driven primarily by the food system, combined with pollution and climate change increases the likelihood of reaching local, regional and global tipping point — a critical threshold resulting in potentially irreversible change.In the Indian context, it cites an example of Chennai, saying the rapid urban expansion in the city has resulted in an 85 per cent decline in wetlands areas during the period leaving the people vulnerable to both droughts and floods.“When severe drought hit the region, it caused the city’s major reservoirs to run dry and groundwater levels to plummet in 2019. Without its wetlands to retain and recharge water supplies, the city of 11.2 million people was left vulnerable and forced to truck in water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing,” said the report.Referring to a 2022 nationwide survey in India, experts from WWF-India noted that the white-rumped vulture population has dropped by 67 per cent, the Indian vulture by 48 per cent, and the slender-billed vulture by a staggering 89 per cent compared to their populations in 2002.Since vultures provide essential ecosystem services by removing carcasses, recycling nutrients and reducing transmission of some diseases, they called for an urgent need to protect these critical scavengers and maintain ecological balance.Citing an example of an increase in tiger population, they, however, noted that despite a decline in many wildlife populations in India, some have stabilised and shown recovery largely due to proactive government initiatives, effective habitat management and robust scientific interventions.Explaining the tipping point, the WWF-India experts, including Sejal Worah and Dipankar Ghose, also flagged that more than 36 per cent of the country’s forest cover has been estimated to be prone to frequent forest fires, noting that India detected a total of over 4.48 lakh alerts for forest fires between 2021 and 2024.At a regional level, the fastest declines in ‘monitored wildlife populations’ have been noticed in Latin America and the Caribbean (95 per cent) followed by Africa (76 per cent) and Asia and the Pacific (60 per cent). The report noted that the declines have been less dramatic in Europe and Central Asia (35 per cent) and North America (39 per cent), saying this reflects the fact that large-scale impacts on nature were already apparent before 1970 in these regions.Noting that over half of GDP (55 per cent) is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services, the report called for making progress on the global goals for reversing nature loss by 2030 through transforming energy, food and finance systems.“Nature is issuing a distress call. The linked crises of nature loss and climate change are pushing wildlife and ecosystems beyond their limits, with dangerous global tipping points threatening to damage Earth’s life-support systems and destabilize societies. The catastrophic consequences of losing some of our most precious ecosystems, like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs, would be felt by people and nature around the world,” said Kirsten Schuijt, director general of WWF International.","There has been a steep 73 per cent decline globally in the average size of ‘monitored wildlife populations ’ in just 50 years (1970-2020), said the WWF ’s Living Planet Report-2024.

Paw-sitive legacy: Bombay House-Tata Group's century doors remain open to strays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paw-sitive-legacy-bombay-house-tata-groups-century-doors-remain-open-to-strays/articleshow/114100669.cms,"Legend Ratan Tata No More; Dies At Mumbai Hospital I Tributes Pour In I Tata Sons

While Ratan Tata 's love for animals is well documented, it is also no secret that the only denizens allowed to walk into Bombay House - the Tata Group 's century-old headquarters in Mumbai - without an access card are stray dogs . When the century-old heritage building was renovated and reopened in July 2018, the 86-year-old chairman of Tata Trusts is believed to have allocated a room for the welfare of streets dogs in the vicinity.Apart from non-residents who saunter in now and then, the swish yellow ground-floor kennel - that has a flap door, a bathing area and a team of doctors - houses the formerly-homeless Goa, Sweety, Junior, Simba, Chhotu, Rana, Jackal, Bushy and Munni as permanent residents. Besides cushions, toys and chewies, their upgraded lifestyle apparently entails food boiled in the five-star's kitchen.His social media accounts offer a visual collage of Tata's love for canines. Sur, Sprite and Myra are among the hounds in need on behalf of whom he has posted timely pleas seeking things like blood donation and adoption. ""Of all the different sufferings that animals today have to go through, my heart truly breaks for the ones that get abandoned by families. I cannot imagine what must go through their minds when one day they have a home, and the next they don't,"" read a post urging people to adopt 9-month-old Myra, a dog that had been abandoned.Another monsoon-related post talked about the importance of checking under the car before turning it on to avoid injuries to stray animals taking shelter.On the 14th birthday of his late dog, Tito, the caption under a picture posted on Instagram that showed the veteran holding his pet's paw read: ""I still come home to two kind souls and meet so many others in and around the office. While few have the comfort of families, many struggle on the streets, and yet somehow, their affection remains the same. Those of you who strive for the welfare of the voiceless, truly have my respect.""It was Tata's transcontinental struggle to find advanced care for his injured dog that recently led to the birth of six-month-old Small Animal Hospital Mumbai (SAHM) - a 98,000 square-feet facility in Mahalaxmi that offers round-the-clock medical care for dogs, cats, rabbits, and other small animals. In an exclusive interview with TOI before the hospital's inauguration, Tata had recalled the ordeal he faced before he flew his dog to University of Minnesota in the US for a joint replacement. ""But I was too late, and so they froze the dog's joint in a particular position. That experience enabled me to see what a world-class veterinary hospital was equipped to do.""""In a world where pandemics are caused by the proximity of animals and humans; where rabies still kills; and where there is a rising storm of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; animal health is more important than ever,"" says the hospital's chief veterinary officer Dr Thomas Heathcote in a quote mentioned on the hospital website, adding that SAHM believe in partnering with pet parents and other vets of Mumbai to create a positive world ""where health and wellness are achievable, and medical assistance is accessible to all.""","The 86-year-old chairman of Tata Trusts is believed to have allocated a room for the welfare of streets dogs in the vicinity.

Advocate’s Appeal: A Call for Justice

Urgency in the Situation

UGC NET Exam Background and Recent Developments

A Supreme Court advocate, Ujjawal Gaur, has stepped forward to support UGC NET candidates, urging the authorities to release the results without further delay. Through a formal letter addressed to the Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the National Testing Agency (NTA), Gaur emphasised the distress faced by students due to the prolonged delay in result declaration.If the delay continues, Gaur has indicated a willingness to pursue judicial intervention to ensure justice for students.Supreme Court advocate and member of both the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA), Ujjawal Gaur, voiced his concerns regarding the delay in UGC NET results on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He wrote, ""I have formally addressed a letter to the @ugc_india Chairman and @NTA_Exams Chairperson, urging the immediate release of the UGC NET results. The continued delay is a serious infringement on student’s rights and is causing unnecessary hardship. If needed, we are prepared to seek judicial intervention. Rest assured, I stand firmly with you in this pursuit of justice.""In his letter, Gaur highlighted the severe disruption in students' academic and professional lives, caused by the prolonged wait for their UGC NET results. He stressed that this delay not only undermines the students' efforts but also violates their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution, which ensure equality before the law and the right to practice any profession. Gaur's intervention comes at a critical time when many academic and professional vacancies are closing, leaving students unable to apply or progress in their careers.In his letter to the UGC Chairman, Advocate Ujjawal Gaur underscored the emotional and financial toll the delay is taking on students, many of whom come from modest backgrounds. ""Every passing day without the declaration of results erodes their hope and leaves them further behind in securing crucial opportunities,"" Gaur wrote, highlighting the plight of students whose futures are hanging in the balance.Gaur expressed faith in the Indian judiciary’s role in upholding justice, emphasising that if the UGC and NTA fail to act promptly, judicial intervention would be sought to protect the rights of the students. ""The courts have consistently demonstrated their sensitivity to such issues, ensuring that fairness and transparency prevail,"" he stated, reaffirming his commitment to seeking justice for the students if necessary.The advocate's letter concludes with a call for immediate action, urging the UGC and NTA to restore students' faith in the system by releasing the results promptly. Gaur’s intervention is not merely a legal threat, but a representation of the collective hope and aspirations of thousands of students. He reaffirmed his commitment to standing by them, ensuring that they are not left behind in their academic and professional pursuits.With judicial intervention on the horizon, the UGC and NTA face growing pressure to act swiftly, ensuring transparency and fairness in the result declaration process.The UGC National Eligibility Test (NET) is a significant examination conducted twice a year by the NTA to determine the eligibility of Indian candidates for the role of Assistant Professor and for Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in Indian universities and colleges. The exam has two papers: a common paper and a subject-specific paper, both consisting of multiple-choice questions. The June 2024 session of UGC NET was conducted from 21st August to 4th September 2024 after a series of complications.The original June session had to be rescheduled after the 18th June 2024 exam was cancelled due to allegations of a question paper leak. Rumours suggested that the exam paper had been distributed on the darknet two days prior to the test. However, later investigations revealed that the exam might not have been leaked, but this delay caused widespread confusion and necessitated the re-examination. Following the successful re-examination, students were left waiting for the release of the results, which are still pending.On 26th September 2024, the NTA released the provisional answer key, allowing candidates to raise objections until 14th September 2024. However, students reported that the answer key was riddled with errors, with some papers allegedly containing over 30 incorrect answers out of the 150 questions.

Ratan Tata's legacy





Rendezvous with Simi Garewal and Ratan Tata 1997

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

Congress's 'alliance of convenience' comes under fire as Haryana loss wipes out Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-alliance-of-convenience-comes-under-fire-as-haryana-loss-wipes-out-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/114087221.cms,"'Overconfident and arrogant'

'SP snubs Congress'

'Congress ignores regional parties when ... '

'This attitude leads to electoral losses '

NEW DELHI: The Congress, which was riding high on its success in Lok Sabha elections, has literally fallen flat after the party's stunning defeat in Haryana assembly elections. The Haryana results have left the Congress bleeding - with not just the BJP but even the INDIA bloc partners unsparing in their attacks on the grand-old-party.Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed a scathing attack on the Congress calling it an ""irresponsible party"" and a ""factory to spread hatred."" He also accused the Congress of dividing Hindu society for its political gains and scaring Muslims into becoming party's votebank.But it is not PM Modi's sharp attacks that may rattle the Congress. The party would be more worried about the fallout of this result on its role as the fulcrum of the INDIA bloc.Unfortunately for the Congress, Haryana elections have reinforced two perceptions that go against the party in INDIA bloc. First, the Congress cannot defeat the BJP alone in direct contests; and second, the Congress does not make efforts to take its allies together in states where it has a strong presence or where it is confident of winning alone.In Haryana, the Congress and AAP held discussions for seat sharing after Rahul Gandhi urged the state unit to explore possibilities of contesting the elections under INDIA banner. However, the talks failed to materialise and the two parties contested as rivals in the state.The AAP, which failed to open its account in the state, has claimed that the results would have been different had the two parties contested together. However, results show that AAP alliance could have helped Congress gain only four more seats - Assandh, Dabwali, Uchhana Kalan and Rania. In all these four seats, the voted polled by AAP candidates was more than the Congress's defeat margin. Two of these seats were won by the BJP and the other two by the INLD.Calling Congress ""overconfident and arrogant"", AAP has announced that it will go solo in Delhi assembly polls next year. ""In Delhi, AAP will contest alone. We are capable of fighting the overconfident Congress and arrogant BJP alone,"" party spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said.On Tuesday, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal had said the biggest lesson from the recent round of elections was one should not be ""overconfident"".In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party went a step ahead and unilaterally announced 6 out of the 10 candidates for assembly bypolls due in the state. This despite the fact that the two parties had contested the assembly polls in alliance under the INDIA banner.The Samajwadi Party also has had a bitter alliance experience with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh when during assembly elections, it was openly snubbed on seat sharing. Kamal Nath who led the Congress campaign in the state refused to acknowledge Akhilesh Yadav's party as an alliance partner.The Shiv Sena (UBT) also trained its guns on the Congress and accused it of ignoring other parties that resulted in Haryana poll debacle. Party leader Sanjay Raut said the Congress' ""over confidence"" was responsible for its defeat in Haryana, alleging that it relies on allies only in regions where they are weak but ignores them in its stronghold areas.""Wherever the Congress is weak, it takes help from the regional parties. But where it thinks it is strong, the Congress attaches no importance to the regional parties,"" Raut said.""We could win in Jammu and Kashmir because the INDIA bloc was fighting there under the leadership of Omar Abdullah and Farooq Abdullah. In Haryana, the INDIA bloc did not fight together because the Congress thought they could win on their own. Hooda ji is our friend, he thought he could win on his own,"" he said.Another Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said the Congress needs to introspect over its loss as it was in direct contest with the BJP. ""The Congress has to introspect. There was a direct contest with the BJP. Where did they all fall short? I am sure they will analyse that,"" she said.TMC MP Saket Gokhale took potshots at Congress without naming the party and slammed its attitude of not accommodating regional parties in places where they felt they were winning is leading to electoral losses.""This attitude leads to electoral losses -- if we feel we're winning, we will not accommodate any regional party... But in states where we're down, regional parties must accommodate us,"" the TMC MP said in a post on X.""Arrogance, entitlement and looking down on regional parties is a recipe for disaster,"" he said.Even National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah had a piece of advice for his ally. ""The Congress will have to go deep into it and find the reasons for its defeat,"" Abdullah said.Clearly, the Haryana debacle will reduce Congress's bargaining power within the INDIA bloc. Elections are due in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi. In all these states, the party is an alliance partner with other INDIA bloc parties.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed a scathing attack on the Congress calling it an ""irresponsible party"" and a ""factory to spread hatred"" The Shiv Sena (UBT) accused the Congress of ignoring other parties that resulted in Haryana poll debacle.

Mr Ratan N. Tata Exclusive Interview with Suhel Seth

MUMBAI: Ratan Naval Tata, whose long stewardship saw the Tata Group transform into a global powerhouse, passed away at Breach Candy Hospital around 11pm on Wednesday night. The 86-year-old was admitted for dehydration issues on Monday.Tata’s passing marks the end of an extraordinary corporate journey, one that not only reshaped the Tata Group but also set new benchmarks for Indian industry on the global stage.Under his stewardship, the group’s revenue surged from $4 billion in 1991 to over $100 billion by 2012, when he retired, making it the first Indian conglomerate to achieve such a milestone.Born to Soonoo and Naval Tata during British rule in Mumbai (then Bombay), Ratan Tata grew up in Tata House — now the India headquarters of Deutsche Bank — in Fort. A teetotaller and a non-smoker, he was a bachelor who came close to marrying thrice but remained single throughout his life.He is survived by two brothers, Jimmy and Noel, and their families, along with his stepmother, Simone Tata.Educated at three prestigious institutions including Campion School and Cathedral and John Connon School in South Mumbai, and Bishop Cotton in Shimla, Ratan Tata shared classrooms with notable figures like music maestro Zubin Mehta and business magnates Ashok Birla and Rahul Bajaj, Duke owner Dinshaw Pandole and Cipla’s Yusuf Hamied.He went on to get a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University, initially starting as an engineering student at his father’s insistence. Disenchanted with engineering, he shifted to architecture after two years and briefly worked with Jones and Emmons in Los Angeles, turning down a job offer from IBM. In 1962, he joined Tata Group as an assistant in Tata Industries, rising to the top after 29 years to become chairman of Tata Sons.His tenure was marked by a concerted effort to remove the old guard of satraps and to position Tata Sons as the nerve centre for strategic direction across the group. His leadership also saw Tata Sons tighten its grip over group companies, requiring them to pay royalties for using the Tata brand.He led the group into new sectors like telecom and passenger cars and was instrumental in fostering innovation with landmark projects such as Indica, India’s first indigenous car; Nano, the world’s most affordable vehicle; and Ginger, a budget hotel chain, while overseeing more than 60 acquisitions that expanded the group’s reach. He also took Tata Consultancy Services public, the only major Tata company to do so.Ratan Tata’s legacy, however, was not without controversies. His decision to appoint Cyrus Mistry as his successor in 2011 sparked one of the most contentious chapters in the group’s history. He subsequently selected N Chandrasekaran to lead Tata Sons after Mistry's acrimonious exit in 2016. Additionally, his dream of creating the world’s cheapest car (Nano) faced political opposition in West Bengal, leading to the relocation of production to Gujarat.In 2008, Ratan Tata was awarded the Padma Vibhushan , India's second-highest civilian honour.Despite his many successes, Ratan Tata remained remarkably humble, often attributing his achievements to the efforts of those around him. A believer in steering clear of politics, he once remarked, “Like my mentor JRD Tata, I had never considered politics. I am not cut out to be a political person and will not venture into it.”Beyond the boardroom, he was known for his quiet but resolute demeanour, often choosing to stay out of the limelight. His contributions extended far beyond business as he led numerous philanthropic initiatives through the Tata Trusts , quietly but significantly impacting sectors like healthcare, education, and rural development.He maintained a low profile in retirement, with sporadic public appearances — the last one being on August 15 this year, when he visited the Tata Fire Temple in Bandra to celebrate the Parsi new year.In the post-retirement years, Ratan Tata also became an angel investor in numerous startups, including Upstox, FirstCry, and Ola Electric – proof, if any was needed, of his continued commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship. He also significantly increased his focus on philanthropy through Tata Trusts, transforming the organisation’s funding approach to prioritise large-scale social initiatives, such as establishing cancer care hospitals and setting up India’s largest tertiary care centre for small animals, including strays, in Mumbai.Though his physical activity decreased in recent years, with even more reduced public appearances, he maintained sharp eyesight and engaged in virtual meetings for both official and philanthropic work.Beyond business, Ratan Tata had a personal passion for aviation, holding pilot licences for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. He was also an avid scuba diver and indulged in it until health restrictions limited his mobility. He also had a deep love for dogs, building a special swimming pool for his pets at his Colaba residence, Halekai.Ratan Tata himself designed Halekai as well as his 2,000sq ft beach bungalow in Alibaug. His connection to architecture extended to two other homes he designed in Jamshedpur on road no. 10, Circuit House (East). One of the houses belonged to Soli Devitre, then Tata Sons’ director Jehangir Ghandy’s brother-in-law, and the other belonged to Tata Steel’s former senior executive Cawas Mehta and his wife Perin C Mehta. The properties now have new owners.And just as those homes will always bear his aesthetic stamp, Indian business will bear the imprint of Ratan Tata.","Ratan Naval Tata, 86, passed away at Breach Candy Hospital around 11pm on Wednesday night. The 86-year-old was admitted for dehydration issues on Monday. Under his stewardship, the group’s revenue surged from $4 billion in 1991 to over $100 billion by 2012.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114097112,imgsize-963494,width-400,resizemode-4/114097112.jpg"

India clears two mega defence projects for 2 indigenous nuclear submarines & 31 Predator drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-clears-two-mega-defence-projects-for-2-indigenous-nuclear-submarines-31-predator-drones/articleshow/114095147.cms,"INS Chakra

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday cleared the mega indigenous project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as the deal to acquire 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones from the US, collectively worth around Rs 68,000 crore, as part of the long-term plan to counter China’s aggressive and expansionist tactics in the region, sources told TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore `Project-77’ to construct the two nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs in naval parlance), which will be armed with conventional missiles, torpedoes and other weapons, at the ship-building centre at Visakhapatnam , the sources said.The CCS also gave the green signal to the around Rs 28,000 crore ($3.3 billion) acquisition of the 31 MQ-9B drones, with 15 Sea Guardians earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, paving the way for the govt-to-govt deal to be inked within the next few days.Both the SSNs and the MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft are `hunter-killer’ weapon platforms because they can quietly gather intelligence, track enemy targets at extended ranges and then destroy them if required. The twin-capability, one deep underwater and the other high in the air, is crucial given China’s rapidly-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond.“It will take around 10-12years for the first SSN, with a 190 MW pressurised light-water reactor and a displacement of almost 10,000-tonne, to roll out. The two SSNs will be around 95% indigenous, with foreign help only being taken for some design consultancy,” a source said.The original case was for six such SSNs, which with their speeds of over 30 knots, long endurance and capability to discreetly operate in enemy waters are meant for conventional (non-nuclear) warfare. “Apart from anti-ship missiles and torpedoes to take out enemy warships and submarines, they will also have land-attack cruise missiles. The other four SSNs will be cleared at a later stage,” a source said.The approval comes soon after India commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN, which is for strategic deterrence, not conventional warfare) as INS Arighaat on Aug 29, and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year.TOI was the first to report on Aug 10 about the impending commissioning of INS Arighaat as well as that the case for the two SSNs was headed for the final approval of the CCS after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations.The first MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft, in turn, will be delivered within three years, with all the 31 coming in six years after being assembled in India. They are capable of long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and over-the-horizon targeting, and can also undertake anti-warship and anti-submarine warfare operations.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 fighter-sized drones will come with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment.India will also equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO , in the future.Under the deal, drone-manufacturer General Atomics will set up a MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here and provide performance-based logistics support for eight years. Apart from making an investment in India and sourcing 34% of components from Indian companies, the company will also provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such high-altitude, long endurance drones indigenously.The sheer operational utility of SSNs can be gauged from the fact that the AUKUS military pact among the US, UK and Australia, with an eye firmly on China, revolves around Canberra gradually acquiring at least eight SSNs.In India, as per long-standing approved plans, four SSBNs and six SSNs, apart from 18 diesel-electric submarines, are required to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan.","The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore project. The two nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs in naval parlance) will be armed with conventional missiles, torpedoes and other weapons. Both the SSNs and the MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft are `hunter- killer’ weapon platforms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114095133,imgsize-22152,width-400,resizemode-4/114095133.jpg"

"Man declares income of Rs 9.5k, pays tax on Rs 43.5L after US earnings added",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-declares-income-of-9-5k-pays-tax-on-43-5l-after-us-earnings-added/articleshow/114058589.cms,"Representative AI image (Pic credit: Canva)

Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India

MUMBAI: The income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) recently ruled that income earned in the US would be taxable for an individual residing in India. While the individual initially declared an income of Rs 9,570 for 2012-13, his taxable income surged to Rs 43.5 lakh after the US income was added.Under tax laws, residential status determines tax liability. Non-residents, for example, are not taxed in India on foreign income.However, in this case, the individual was a tax resident of both India and the US, requiring the application of the 'tie-breaker test' under the India-US tax treaty to determine which country he was a resident of.Applying this test, which takes into account certain criteria, ITAT concluded that the individual's ""centre of vital interest"" was closer to India, making his US income taxable in India.Applying the tiebreaker test, ITAT, in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship). “In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident. Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic relationships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India. His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US.The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India.

In a letter to party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, EC said the “unprecedented statement (by Ramesh and Khera)...unheard of in the rich democratic heritage of the country, is far from a legitimate part of free speech and expression and moves towards an undemocratic rejection of the will of the people...”The standoff between Election Commission and Congress intensified on Wednesday. A day after Congress, in a first for a national party, refused to accept the Haryana verdict dubbing it “unexpected and unacceptable”, top party leaders met the EC and submitted a memorandum demanding a thorough probe even as the poll panel slammed Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Pawan Khera for their “unprecedented” statement that the results were “unacceptable”, saying it amounted to “undemocratic rejection of the will of the people”.A Congress delegation comprising former CMs Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Gehlot and party leaders K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh, Ajay Maken and Pawan Khera and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan met the EC and demanded that all the machines for which complaints have been made should be sealed and secured till the inquiry was completed. Senior party leader Abhishek Singhvi joined the meeting online.The poll panel made a distinction between the statements of Congress spokespersons Ramesh and Khera and party president Mallikarjun Kharge’s response to the result. Unlike the two spokespersons, Kharge refrained from rejecting the result, limiting himself to describing it as “unexpected”. EC said it agreed to hear the Congress delegation on EVM grievances only because it considered the party president’s position not rejecting the outcome, and not that of the two spokespersons, to be the party’s official stance.In a strongly-worded letter to Kharge, EC said the “unprecedented statement (by Ramesh and Khera)... in a generic sense, unheard in the rich democratic heritage of India, is far from a legitimate part of free speech and expression and moves towards an undemocratic rejection of the will of the people expressed in accordance with the statutory and regulatory electoral framework, uniformly applied across all polls in the country, including J&K and Haryana”.The stand taken by Jairam and Khera had raised many eyebrows as no national party had so far outright rejected polls, something which is a regular feature in many countries.Though Congress said EVM issues were raised in seven assembly constituencies with no action taken by the returning officer (RO), EC sources told TOI that six complaints were received during counting in Haryana, of which only one related to discrepancy in the battery life of EVMs. “All these complaints were disposed of by RO before declaration of the results. Congress candidates concerned signed the result sheet. Yet, they are now flooding EC with complaints,” an EC functionary said.As per Section 81 of Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, once the result is declared by the RO, it can only be challenged by filing an election petition in the high court within 45 days. “All parties are well versed with these provisions but end up publicly making EVMs or EC the fall guy to build a narrative and cover up their electoral defeat. This noise is rarely followed up with election petitions,” a former legal advisor to EC said.Barely 92 election petitions were filed within the 45-day timeframe after 2024 Lok Sabha elections, as against 138 filed post the 2019 LS polls.In its memorandum addressed to the chief election commissioner, Congress said, “During counting of votes for Haryana, a glaring discrepancy was discovered by INC candidates and their respective polling agents related to the battery charge/health/capacity of the EVM machines.”","The standoff between Election Commission and Congress intensified on Wednesday.

Not really, if we look solely at the arithmetic. There were only three seats of the 53 that Congress did not win in which AAP got more votes than the margin for the eventual winner.Thus, even if we were to assume that a Congress-AAP alliance would have garnered all of the votes that Congress and AAP got contesting on their own, the alliance would at best have won three more seats taking the tally to 40 against the 37 that Congress actually won.Of the three seats, only one was actually won by the BJP. That was Assandh in Karnal district, where BJP got 54,761 votes, beating the Congress tally of 52,455 by 2,306 votes. The AAP candidate here received 4,290 votes.The other two seats were the only ones that INLD won in the state - Dabwali and Rania in Sirsa district.In Dabwali, INLD got 56,074 votes and Congress 55,464 which meant INLD won by 610 votes. The AAP candidate got 6,606 votes. In Rania, INLD got 43,914 and Congress 39,723 to lose by 4,191 votes. AAP got 4,697 votes.If we assume the votes would have been seamlessly transferred between Congress and AAP, these three seats could have been won by an alliance between the two. That would have meant 47 seats to BJP, 40 to the Congress-AAP alliance and none for INLD, which would not have changed the outcome though reducing the gap.Of course, alliances are not just about arithmetic, but whether an alliance between the two parties would have generated a buzz for AAP and Congress is a moot question.","There were only three seats of the 53 that Congress did not win in which AAP got more votes than the margin for the eventual winner.

NC unlikely to reverse 10% ST quota for Paharis in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nc-unlikely-to-reverse-10-st-quota-for-paharis-in-jk/articleshow/114099768.cms,"SRINAGAR: There is unlikely to be a reversal of the 10% ST reservation carved out for the Pahari community in J&K, National Confernce sources said Wednesday, arguing that rolling back the quota could lead to agitations which would not be in the interest of the new party-led govt.The reservation, unveiled ahead of the J&K assembly polls, results of which were declared Tuesday, was seen as part of political quid pro quo struck by BJP with the Pahari community.But, BJP failed to win in Rajouri and Poonch areas which are populated by Paharis.The quota issue remains a heartburn among the youth and the non-reserved classes as total reservation in J&K has increased to 70%, majorly shrinking the space for open merit. During the poll campaign, protesters had demanded that the new govt reverse the policy, with claims that the 10% quota is disproportionately higher to the population of the beneficiaries.Out of the eight seats in Poonch and Rajouri, BJP could win only Kalakot, while NC won four, two went to Independents and one to Congress. These are the pockets where BJP had high hopes of expanding its footprint.Ahead of the polls, the UT administration announced 10% reservation for Paharis and three other communities, besides the existing 10% ST reservation that includes Gujjars/Bakarwals.NC sources ruled out a revision, arguing that quota is a sensitive subject, and taking back what has been given can touch off protests which would not be in the interest of the new regime.""I don't think we can touch the status quo. It will create a headache and open a new political front. As is it, with what the Centre has done to the powers of the state, there are already many fronts open,"" a top NC functionary said.The failure of BJP to capitalize on the Pahari reservation brought a sense of relief to NC and Congress who ""were worried about its fallout"" in the elections. Their major fear was that it could help BJP win in Muslim areas of Poonch and Rajouri, which would have been at the cost of the ""secular"" parties. Finally, BJP was confined to 29 MLAs.""We were worried. Only Budhal in Rajouri has majority of Gujjar community, while the other seven seats have Paharis in higher numbers,"" said the NC functionary, suggesting that BJP could have won up to seven seats if Paharis had voted for it in big numbers in Nowshera, Poonch, Mendhar, Rajouri, Thanamandi and Surankote.Now, BJP's failure has become a source of satire on social media, with people mocking that the party was fooled by its greed for power into giving a 10% quota.","The reservation was seen as part of political quid pro quo struck by BJP with the Pahari community.

NEW DELHI: BJP swept all the seven seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Jammu, while bagging eight of the 17 in Haryana , leading its functionaries to claim that Congress 's allegation that the Modi govt was conspiring to scrap caste quotas has petered out.In 2019, BJP had won five seats reserved for SCs in Haryana while Congress won six. In the 2014 polls in Jammu & Kashmir, before delimitation in 2022 which resulted in an increase of seats from 83 to 90, BJP won five seats reserved for SCs in Jammu and Congress bagged one.Speaking at the post-poll celebrations at BJP headquarters on Tuesday evening, PM Narendra Modi had highlighted BJP's strong performance in constituencies reserved for SCs.""People have seen through the falsehood Rahul Gandhi spread during Lok Sabha polls,"" Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who was in-charge of BJP's Haryana campaign, said.The highest winning margin among reserved seats in Haryana was recorded in Pataudi, where BJP's Bimla Chaudhary defeated Congress's Pearl Choudhary by 46,530 votes. In Jammu, the largest winning margin was seen in Akhnoor constituency, where BJP's Mohan Lal defeated Congress's Ashok Kumar by 24,679 votes.Anand Kumar, retired professor of sociology at JNU, said BJP's improved showing in Haryana was because of Congress's projection of B S Hooda as its CM candidate at the cost of Kumari Selja, former Union minister and the party's biggest Dalit face in Haryana. The two previous tenures of Hooda were identified with Jat hegemony and instances of high-handedness against Dalits, especially the killing of two Dalits in Mirchpur.BJP talked up the incidents during the campaign, besides accusing Congress of marginalising Selja because of her Dalit background. The party also supported the demand for sub-categorisation of Dalits in the state to ensure that the benefits of quotas travel beyond the Jatavs to the more disadvantaged SC categories: a social agglomerate of several castes which put together match the numbers of Jatavs, the single most numerically preponderant Dalit caste in the state.Dr Manoj Kumar, a political commentator who teaches at Delhi University, said the Modi govt's focus on ""inclusive development"" since 2014 has led to many sections of SCs developing a positive view of BJP. ""Congress's narrative may have worked before the Lok Sabha elections but it was unlikely to resonate forever,"" he said.Prof Ashwini Kumar of the School of Development Studies put Congress's dismal showing in the SC seats of Jammu, and rise of BJP's share in the ones in Haryana to the latter's weakness against the Modi-led saffron outfit in bipolar contexts. ""This is a reflection of their general weakness,"" he said.","BJP swept all the seven seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Jammu, while bagging eight of the 17 in Haryana.

Naya Kashmir? BJP's Jammu confinement reeks of the old,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naya-kashmir-bjps-jammu-confinement-reeks-of-the-old/articleshow/114099606.cms,"SRINAGAR: PM Modi's ""Naya Kashmir "" turned out to be so yesterday on Tuesday.The National Conference-Congress alliance, flagging the fear of BJP in the wake of the revocation of special status and downgrading of J&K as UT, swept the Kashmir region. Despite Congress 's failure to damage BJP in Jammu in the face of the latter's overwhelming campaign which included the push for ""Dogra CM"", J&K delivered a verdict that is bound to sound warning bells in the Delhi establishment.NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah called the results a ""people's rejection of the decisions of August 5, 2019"".That BJP became the bogeyman of the election is spotlighted by two facts. While PDP was punished for its 2014-18 alliance govt with BJP, that was followed by the abrogation of Article 370 , the much-touted ""X-factors"" - Engineer Rashid, Apni Party, DPAP of Ghulam Nabi Azad and Independents - were swept away amid avalanche of allegations of being ""Delhi's fronts"" sent to divide the votes of the mainstream parties to later emerge as pillars of a BJP govt. Engineer's Awami Ittehad Party failed even in Baramulla that he won in Lok Sabha elections from prison. The clear verdict also puts the INDIA alliance beyond the fear of ""five nominated MLAs"", a major row that erupted ahead of the results.Omar Abdullah's decision to junk PDP after being part of the post-370 Gupkar Alliance was vindicated, having already defeated PDP in the Lok Sabha polls in June. Now, PDP is staring at an existential crisis.The return of NC restores the salience of Sheikh Abdullah family in J&K politics, which came to battle a two-front challenge over last two decades - while emergence of PDP erected a rival in Kashmir and Jammu regions both, the post-2014 BJP fragmented the state into parallel political entities and established its dominance in the Hindu pockets of Jammu. The twin developments majorly diminished the space for NC.Evidently, BJP started the 2024 assembly elections with a special strategy. Convinced of its hold over Jammu, it took a leap of faith by creating ""proxies"" in Kashmir to fill the future numbers gap. The ""proxies"" came at the cost of PDP which haemorrhaged its leadership structure, losing 43 important faces by a calculation. First to go was Altaf Bukhari who launched Apni Party, and when he was seen floundering came the exit of Ghulam Nabi Azad from Congress who formed DPAP. Both faced charges of being BJP's fronts. But when they failed to live up to their initial promise, the victory of Engineer over Omar in LS polls threw up a new and more viable option for BJP. To the shock of all, he secured bail to campaign, reinforcing the ""proxy"" charge. In the end, they all came a cropper.BJP's 29 seats mark a decent tally but impresses its continued ghettoisation in Jammu, with signs of stagnation. It is a disappointment for its strategy to win over Muslim communities with reservation for Paharis, to expand its footprint.The party won 25/37 seats in 2014 state polls held after Modi’s advent on the national scene, and led in 25 assembly segments in the post-Pulwama 2019 LS polls, then leading in 29 assemblies out of post-delimitation 43 segments in 2024 LS polls. Jammu-based journalist Mohit Kandhari says, “For BJP to now end up with the same 29, and that too with very close margins on some of the Hindu seats against Congress, is a cause of concern as it was eyeing to finally break out of its stronghold.”While the results now pose a problem for NC which would need some Hindu faces to join the govt, a predicament which supposedly saw late Mufti Mohd Sayeed to strike an alliance with BJP in 2014, the Abdullahs are unlikely to go down the PDP road. But the greater dilemma will be for BJP which has seen junking of the special status has not gone down well in Kashmir, even as it does not animate Jammu so much.The mandate is clearly a rewind to the old days of Jammu & Kashmir, sans 370.","NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah called the results a ""people's rejection of the decisions of August 5, 2019"" The much-touted ""X-factors"" - Engineer Rashid, Apni Party, DPAP of Ghulam Nabi Azad and Independents - were swept away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114099750,imgsize-56852,width-400,resizemode-4/114099750.jpg"

The case originated from a tip-off purportedly received by crime branch inspector K C Ashokan on May 7, 2012 about Rehman getting introduced to LeT operatives through Pasha and Khoya, both of whom he met in Bengaluru jail after their arrest on different charges.The prosecution linked all three to a conspiracy allegedly hatched by LeT to recruit Muslim youth for terrorist activities, including blasts in Bengaluru.A trial court convicted the trio of criminal conspiracy and waging war against the state, for which they were sentenced to life and additional 5-10 years under UAPA and the Explosive Substances Act.The division bench hearing their appeal pointed out that the UAPA case was not referred to an independent review authority, as mandated by law. “In view of this, the sanction order (to invoke UAPA) loses its sanctity, which the trial court failed to consider,” it said. The court also pointed out that “mere meetings” in jail among the trio and their call details were insufficient to infer conspiracy, and that the evidence did not support their conviction.

They were shouting ""Sati mata ki jai"", which amounted to glorification of the banned practice.

We will increase our lead,” NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said Wednesday.NC, with 42 seats, emerged as the single largest party. Congress won six, and CPM 1, taking the alliance tally to 49. With the backing of six independents, NC’s numbers would rise to 48 — the figure required for a comfortable majority in assembly on its own.This development comes amid shifting political dynamics in the Union territory. Omar, set to become the next chief minister, acknowledged Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s congratulatory message and sought cordial relations with BJP-led central govt. He also advised ally Congress to introspect on its loss to BJP in Haryana.Elections in Jammu & Kashmir were held for 90 seats, but the assembly’s total strength will be 95, with five MLAs to be nominated by the lieutenant governor. BJP secured 29 seats, all from Jammu region.Omar said NC would challenge the nomination of MLAs in Supreme Court. “You will only nominate five MLAs to sit in the opposition, and there will be a row because we will then have to approach SC and file a case against it… The nomination of five MLAs will not have any impact on govt formation… BJP will not gain anything by nominating these five MLAs,” he said.Sources said the independent MLAs likely to support NC include Jammu region’s Choudhary Mohammad Akram (Surankote), Muzaffar Iqbal Khan (Thanamandi), Payare Lal Sharma (Inderwal), and Dr Rameshwar Singh (Bani), and Khursheed Ahmed Sheikh (Langate) and Shabir Ahmed Kullay (Shopian) from Kashmir Valley.Akram, a long-time NC loyalist, ran as an independent after Surankote went to Congress under the seat-sharing arrangement.

Congress bent on dividing Hindu society on caste lines: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-bent-on-dividing-hindu-society-on-caste-lines-pm-modi/articleshow/114097377.cms,"NAGPUR/NEW DELHI: A day after BJP 's win in Haryana, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday doubled down his attack on Congress for trying to divide Hindu society for its partisan ends and said the opposition, which consistently talks about castes among Hindus, never talks about castes among Muslims, potentially setting the tone for the campaign for the coming contest in Maharashtra.""They (Congress) never discuss caste within the Muslim community, but when it comes to Hindus, they rake up caste issues to divide us,"" the PM said while virtually inaugurating projects worth more than Rs 7,000 crore for poll-bound Maharashra.""Congress's formula is simple: keep Muslims under fear, turn them into a vote bank, and stoke divisions in Hindu society to benefit electorally,"" he said. He termed the party's tactics a betrayal of national unity .While the accusation that Congress had been seeking to split Hindu society for political gains is not new, it is perhaps the first time that Modi had accused the opposition party of keeping mum on castes among Muslims. Significantly, the PM had spoken about the backwardness of Pasmandas, the OBC among Muslims.Modi said Congress wants to keep Hindu society simmering by any means to make political gains. “Wherever elections take place , Congress uses the same formula — to secure its vote bank, sow seeds of division. Congress fights elections purely on the basis of communalism, casteism, and dividing Hindu society,” he said and appealed to people to vote for Mahayuti alliance comprising BJP, Sena (Shinde) and NCP led by Ajit Pawar.This was the third time in last 10 days PM attacked Congress for seeking to split Hindus along castes. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat have also raised the issue, though the latter did not mention Congress.He said entire ecosystem of Congress and the entire gang of urban Naxals were busy misleading public, but all the conspiracies of Congress have been ruined.Referring to BJP’s s record-shattering victory in Haryana, Modi said falsehoods spread by Congress have been exposed. He expressed optimism about BJP’s prospects in ensuing contests. “Just yesterday, election results of Haryana and J&K were declared. Haryana has told what the mood of the country is. It is historic to be elected for the third consecutive time .”Emphasising farmers of Haryana are happy with welfare schemes introduced by BJP govt, Modi said, “Dalit community of Haryana has given record support to BJP.

The unilateral move drew protest from Avinash Pande, Congress secretary in-charge of UP. Congress had refused to share seats with SP in Haryana.It soon became open season on the largest opposition party with even National Conference leader Omar Abdullah saying, “Congress will have to go deep into it and find the reasons for its defeat (in Haryana). Abdullah, who won the J&K polls in alliance with Congress, said, “My job is to run the NC and help the alliance here, which I will.”Left parties and TMC further twisted the knife by saying Congress should learn not to ignore its allies.Shiv Sena (UBT) was the harshest as it virtually accused Congress of being opportunist in its dealings with partners. “Congress relied on allies in weak regions but ignored them where it was strong,” its spokesperson Sanjay Raut wrote in party mouthpiece Saamna. “In Haryana, the INDIA bloc couldn’t form the govt because Congress thought that it could win alone,” he added.“If SP, AAP and parties like ours would have joined them, the result would have been different,” Raut said. The allies won in J&K as Omar Abdullah was the face of the opposition, Raut said.Reiterating the demand to declare the CM face (read Uddhav Thackeray) for Maharashtra elections , Raut said, “In a state like Maharashtra, people want a leader. People cannot digest the policy that you first contest polls and declare the CM's face later.”Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole slammed Raut for his comments and said accusations against the party won't be tolerated. “The political situation in Haryana and Maharashtra is different. Congress fights elections alongside its allies, as was seen in the Lok Sabha elections,"" he said.JMM, which will contest the Jharkhand polls with Congress, advised the party to “come down from its high pedestal” and give due importance to regional parties . Maintaining that the results were not very surprising, party general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “It is a repeat of what happened in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and Congress must learn to give importance to its partners.”Trinamool Congress minced no words in driving home the point. “Arrogance, entitlement and looking down on regional parties is a recipe for disaster,"" party MP Saket Gokhale said on X.“Congress lost again when it was a straight fight between it and BJP. Regional parties do much better in defeating BJP. TMC is the only party in the INDIA bloc who does not have an electoral understanding with Congress. All others do. The question: will Congress ever shed its big brother attitude?” another senior party leader said.Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had questioned Congress’s poll strategy in Haryana. The party announced on Wednesday that it would fight the Delhi assembly polls on its own.RJD too called on Congress to ""introspect (and) focus on accommodative politics"". “Alliance principles should be respected. Big parties should respect regional parties... everyone has to make sacrifices,"" a party leader said.CPM urged secular forces to unite and asked Congress to “introspect” on its strategy in the aftermath of the “unexpected setback” it faced in Haryana.CPI general secretary D Raja too said Congress needed to introspect over the poll results in Haryana and take along all INDIA bloc partners in the upcoming polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand."," INDIA bloc parties came out against it for ""ignoring allies"" and blamed its ""arrogance and overconfidence"" for the debacle.

BENGALURU: Isro , which got the Union cabinet clearance for its fourth lunar mission , the Chandrayaan-4 , has completed the initial design study for setting up a facility to process the 2-3kg of lunar samples this mission will bring back to Earth, while the long-term lunar vision will involve setting up of permanent communication networks and establishing GPS-like infrastructure on Moon and much more.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Isro chairman S Somanath said: “Currently, the experience for handling any such material is only with PRL. And, they have been doing it with very sophisticated instruments. But, raw material containerisation, slicing, and preserving it for long periods of time will all require much more facilities.”At present, he said, project detail has been worked out by PRL and that a configuration of that was available. “Facility building is currently under discussion. This cannot happen in a short time and cost is also high. We will have to look at how to contain costs as we cannot spend too much money on sample processing, this will cost hundreds of crores. So we are looking at how to do it at a low cost. Those discussions are going on,” Somanath said.Pointing out that Chandrayaan-4 and other missions approved by the cabinet on Sept 18 are only part of the first phase of the long-term vision set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Somanath said, space station enhancement will be the next step as the clearance now is only for the first unit of the Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS) and Isro needs four more units of BAS.Following this, Isro will focus on missions to the space station — each mission is a rocket-plus-crew module involving cost, which would differ based on whether it is crewed or uncrewed.“A series of these missions will need approvals, for building/constructing and integration. After that we’ll need at least 3-4 missions a year to the space station. The next set of approvals will be the Chandrayaan series of missions. These are beyond Chandrayaan-5,” Somanath said.Isro will need many technologies to be proven. “For example, we’ll need to go around the Moon and come back. Then, we should scale up the payload capacity which will be similar to the one with the mission that will ultimately take humans to the Moon. We also need to establish communication infrastructure on the Moon so that you don’t depend on the module that we sent alone. We need a permanent communication relay station there,” Somanath said.Human landing would also need navigation infrastructure like GPS. “Landing is very difficult given the nature of the Moon. Right now we use cameras to look at the terrain to finalise a precise location for landing. Precise landing is easier on Earth because we have navigational tools. There are global efforts to build navigation infra for the Moon using multiple satellites and India should also become part of it and make some contribution so that we can use it,” Somanath said.Lastly, he said, India would need to establish ground systems. Right now, Isro has only one deep space network, which won’t be enough. It will need a global network, which includes bigger antennas in other continents.“...We have started discussions on this. We also need to have a space-based communication network using relay satellites. Work on this is happening for Gaganyaan. It has reached reasonable completion and will be launched in the coming days. Many such components are required. We’ve identified various phases in which we will seek approvals,” Somanath said.",Isro has completed the initial design study for setting up a facility to process the 2-3kg of lunar samples this mission will bring back to Earth.
