"Baliga credits his success to rigorous training, curriculum at IIT Madras",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baliga-credits-his-success-to-rigorous-training-curriculum-at-iit-madras/articleshow/113077700.cms,"Bantval Jayant Baliga, winner of the 2024 Millennium Technology Prize , told TOI in an exclusive interview that he puts his success down to the rigorous training and curriculum he received at IIT Madras. The prize is awarded by Technology Academy Finland for innovations that benefit millions of people.Baliga's invention, the insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ), developed in 1980s, is estimated to have reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by over 82 gigatons (180 trillion pounds) in the past 30 years.""This award is coming at the culmination of my career as I am now retiring after 50 years, so the timing is perfect,"" he said.Born in Chennai, Baliga lived in Delhi until he was 10, then went to Bishop Cotton Boys' School in Bengaluru, before studying electrical engineering at IIT Madras. ""The IITs are extremely rigorous and difficult institutions in terms of the rigour of the classroom and practical training... During the first two years we spent a lot of time in the lab rather than in the classroom, so I learnt things other students may not learn. The biggest thing was the extremely competitive, tough climate,"" he told TOI on Zoom. His father, Bantval Vittal Baliga, was the first chief engineer of All India Radio after Indian Independence.Baliga moved to the US in 1969 to do a master's and PhD in electrical engineering at New York's Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He arrived with just $10 in his pocket. ""In 1969, the Indian govt only gave $10 to people leaving for the US due to limited foreign reserves,"" he explained. It was his first trip out of India and the first time he saw snow. ""At that time they were not admitting Indian students to my department. My professor told me later that is because they thought Indian students could not handle the curriculum. I went in and I got a perfect 4.0 GPA during my time there, and then they said, 'Oh, maybe we were wrong' and started letting Indians in.""""I would have gone back to India, but since I was doing work on cutting edge semi-conductors, there was no opportunity to do that in India... Semi-conductors have always had a problem flourishing in India because you needa lot of infrastructure, like good, clean gas, clean water, reliable electricity, and you cannot have any of this interrupted... But there is nothing to stop them being manufactured in India due to the availability of highly educated and capable engineers if sufficient investments are made,"" he said. The prize will be presented to Baliga in Finland on Oct 30 by the Finnish president.","Baliga's invention, the insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ), developed in 1980s, is estimated to have reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by over 82 gigatons (180 trillion pounds) in the past 30 years.

Traffic violations frustrate Union mantri: 'Can't keep on increasing fines',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-violations-frustrate-union-mantri-cant-keep-on-increasing-fines/articleshow/113075574.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expressing frustration at rampant violation of traffic rules despite steep hike in fines , Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday wondered how many times or by how much can govt increase penalties to deter violators. He said there is also a need to induce behavioural change in road users .“We are using technology (ITS) for enforcement of traffic rules.We have increased fines for violations, but it’s not yielding results because people are not taking them seriously. How much fine can we increase? It’s a problem. This can be addressed only by changing human behaviour with the involvement and cooperation of social and educational organisations,” Gadkari said while addressing the World Safety conference.The govt amended the Motor Vehicle Act in 2019 with provisions of high fines and penalties expecting this would prove as a deterrent. But these measures proved inadequate with violation of traffic and transport rules rising and the number of road crash fatalities actually increasing by around 6% from nearly 1.59 lakh in 2019 to 1.68 lakh in 2022.The minister said enforcement alone cannot bring down crashes and fatalities, without focussing on changing road users behaviour by educating people and convincing them to follow road safety rules . On the rising number of two-wheeler riders’ deaths due to riders not wearing helmets, he said he is looking at urging vehicle manufacturers to offer helmets to the buyers at a discount or reasonable rate. In 2022, 50,029 people lost their lives in crashes when they were not wearing helmets.He also flagged the problem of mixed traffic on Indian roads and lack of lane discipline. “We are trying to train the bus and truck drivers, and if they can maintain lane discipline, we can reduce road accidents,” the minister said. He added that large-scale violation of lane driving is coming in the way of increasing the maximum speed limit on access-controlled highways.Gadkari said there is also a need to do more on the trauma care front to save lives.Earlier in the day, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said the govt would soon roll out universal free medical care for 48 hours for all crash victims across the country soon. A pilot run for this is going on in Chandigarh. He added that the govt is working at doubling the fleet under the National Ambulance Service, which is now around 16,000. These will be fitted with modern equipment for 24X7 telehealth services.The global conference attended by top representatives from World Health Organisation, United Nations, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, public health experts called for immediate action for all nations to take a multi-pronged approach to reduce road crashes and fatalities.Etienne Krug, director (social determinants of health) at WHO told TOI, “India having the biggest share of road deaths globally, we need a strong political commitment at national, state and local level. We know what’s to be done and have solutions. Prevention is the best solution. It’s extremely costly to treat victims of road crashes and sometimes the disability is for months, years and for the entire life.”",Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari wondered how many times or by how much can govt increase penalties to deter violators. He said there is also a need to induce behavioural change in road users.

The pact marks yet another step forward in the govt's efforts to bring lasting peace and development to the northeast region .As part of the tripatite memorandum of settlement, over 328 armed cadres of ATTF and NLFT will give up arms and violence, join the mainstream and disband their armed organisations.Centre, Shah said after signing of the memorandum, has approved a Rs 250 crore package for development of Tripura, particularly its tribal-dominated pockets, while preserving their culture, language and identity.""It is an important day as NLFT and ATTF have reaffirmed their commitment towards development of Tripura by ending the 35-year-old conflict in the state,"" Shah said while sharing that the latest memorandum is the 12th for the northeast region and the third for Tripura.Addressing participants during the signing event - attended by Tripura CM Manik Saha and officials of MHA and Tripura govt - Shah underlined how Modi govt has been working since 2014 to realise PM Modi's vision of building a capable and developed northeast through peace and dialogue. Referring to the concept of Ashtalakshami and Purvoday, Shah said the govt has tried to bridge the distance between Delhi and northeast not only with better road, rail and air connectivity but by bringing hearts closer.Shah appreciated the role of Pradyot Debbarma, scion of erstwhile royal family of Tripura, in ending unrest by local tribes.Calling the settlement with NLFT and ATTF ""as yet another milestone in realisation of a fully-developed northeast"", Shah said the 12 peace pacts so far have got 10,000 armed cadres into the mainstream and tackled the cause behind loss of thousands of lives. ""Modi govt remains committed to implementing every peace agreement in letter and spirit,"" Shah said while recounting the earlier peace pacts with NLFT(SD) in 2019, followed by accords with Bru-Reangs and the Bodos in 2020.

Theatre Commands: India's Proposed Integrated Theatre Commands Plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-proposed-integrated-theatre-commands-plan/articleshow/113074831.cms,"NEW DELHI: India’s top military brass is now taking the final look at the blueprint for the proposed theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region, with the aim to ensure a well-integrated war-fighting machinery, at the two-day joint commanders’ conference (JCC) that kicked off in Lucknow on Wednesday.With defence minister Rajnath Singh slated to attend the JCC on Thursday, senior officers told TOI that it will take 12-18 months for the tri-Service theatre commands to take concrete shape on the ground after the final approval by the government.“The blueprint, with the requisite command, control and operational structures for the theatre commands, prepared by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan, is more or less ready. Presentations have been made to the defence minister and others. The government will now have to take the final call,” an officer said.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram.This will involve the IAF giving up its Southern Air Command at Thiruvananthapuram and the Army its South-Western Command at Jaipur for the theatre commands. The Army’s Central Command at Lucknow will be shifted to some other location. At present, India has as many as 17 single-Service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in operations, planning and logistics.A sticking point, however, could be the recommendation that the three theatre commanders-in-chief and a vice CDS should be four-star generals like the CDS and three Service chiefs, who rank above the secretaries to the Union government.At present, the chiefs of the 17 single-service commands and two tri-Service commands (Strategic Forces Command and Andaman Nicobar Command) are senior three-star officers (Lt-Generals, Air Marshals or Vice Admirals).“A four-star officer is needed for the requisite command and control of a theatre since he will have all the three Services under him in that geographical region,” a top officer told TOI.“The maritime theatre command chief, for instance, will have the entire Navy as well as parts of Army and Navy under him. Whether the politico-bureaucratic establishment agrees to four more four-star officers remains to be seen,” he added.Addressing the JCC on Wednesday, Gen Chauhan stressed on enhancing integration across various domains to adapt to the contours of future warfare and conduct of effect-based operations.With the three Services “initiating numerous measures” on the roadmap for integration, the CDS said it was “a step-by-step process, beginning with cross-service cooperation, leading to a ‘joint culture’, and finally achieving integration of forces for conduct of joint operations”.China, incidentally, re-organised its 2-million People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into five theatre commands in early-2016 to boost offensive capabilities and establish better command-and-control structures.The PLA’s Western Theatre Command, for instance, handles the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India, in contrast, has four Army and three IAF commands for the northern borders with China.","India's top military brass is now taking the final look at the blueprint for the proposed theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region.

AHMEDABAD: When Dr Deepak Vyas and Dr Samisth Vyas appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year, they became one of the rare father-son duo who wrote this tough exam together in the same year, on the basis of which admission in PG medical courses is granted in the country.Interestingly, Dr Samisth, who completed his MBBS in 2023 and is currently doing his internship, scored more than his father, who has 28 years of experience! ""Son proved to be better than the father.I had clinical experience, but my son scored better,"" said 51-year-old Dr Vyas.The duo declined to share their scores, saying that the first attempt was more for experience and that Dr Samisth would take the exam again.""When Samisth started preparing for his NEET-PG exams, I decided to give it a shot. When I passed MBBS in 1996, conditions were such that I had to start working and I could not pursue specialisation. Hence, I took it as a challenge to write the NEET-PG exam to test my knowledge, way of learning and format,"" says Dr Deepak Vyas.""I wanted to give company and competition to my son, who passed from GMERS Gandhinagar. We studied together where I guided him in practical aspects, while he would help me with the theoretical aspects from his syllabus.""Dr Vyas said when he last appeared for the MBBS exam 28 years ago, the format was descriptive, and the MCQ format in which NEET-PG is conducted was unthinkable. ""I am from the pen and paper era when MBBS marks were considered for PG admission. Writing the exam on the computer in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format was a new experience,"" added Dr Vyas, a medical counsellor with Apollo Hospitals.The duo said that the examination was a good way to prepare for what comes next – Samisth, who wishes to pursue MD (medicine), will appear next year with better preparation to get admission in his desired field. So, the duo did not fret much about the exam or rank this year as the purpose was not to secure a seat. They had different centres for the exam, they added.The outcome was a win-win. The duo said that it was the spirit of competition that kept them going. ""The result was not the goal – it was the journey, the time spent together and the sense of achievement that we will cherish,"" said Samisth.","Dr Deepak Vyas and his son Samisth appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year.

Three Foreign Nationals Tricked into Kidney Trafficking Scam in India: Harrowing Tales of Betrayal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/lured-with-job-offer-3-bangladesh-men-lose-kidneys-in-india/articleshow/113006025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two decades ago, the Bollywood film Run depicted a young man venturing to Delhi in pursuit of employment only to be snared by kidney transplant scammers . A recent chargesheet filed by the law enforcement authorities reveals a strikingly analogous plot orchestrated by a syndicate that preyed on desperate individuals seeking a better life and left them with an indelible scar and a haunting future.Three Bangladeshi citizens (identities withheld) have disclosed harrowing accounts of falling victim to a kidney trafficking ring operating in India.Their testimonies, documented under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code , expose a sinister scheme in which these unsuspecting individuals were enticed to India with the promise of employment but were deprived of their kidneys in the guise of medical examinations . Sedated and helpless, they would regain consciousness 48 hours later, discovering their kidneys had been harvested with a paltry sum of 4 lakh takas deposited into their bank accounts as compensation.TI, a 30-year-old Bangladeshi man, didn't know whether to celebrate Eid this year or not after being rescued by police from the clutches of the traffickers that day. He had already lost his kidney. TI, who lived with his mother, sister and wife in Bangladesh, had been advised by an acquaintance to seek employment in India .He said, ""When a fire destroyed my cloth business, I took an 8-lakh taka loan from an NGO. I repaid 3 lakh takas, but the remaining debt caused financial strain for us. A friend suggested that I go to India and arranged my passport and medical visa, claiming job opportunities awaited me. On arrival in India on June 1, I was told there were no jobs. But the men pressured me to donate a kidney for money. I refused, but they withheld my passport and visa, threatening to prevent my departure from India unless I complied.""SS, 35, was similarly assured of employment by an individual named Taskin in Bangladesh. He was transported to India on February 2. At the airport two men, Rasel and Mohammed Rokon, were waiting for me. ""I accompanied them to Hotel Rampal in Jasola. I was promised employment at a hospital and told I had to undergo medical examinations in accordance with Indian regulations,"" said SS. ""I undertook 15-20 tests, including blood tests and an ECG. On April 2, I was taken to a hospital where a nurse administered a liquid substance, causing me to lose consciousness.""He continued, ""On April 3, I was administered an injection and became unconscious. Upon regaining consciousness on April 5, I discovered a scar and stitch marks on my abdomen. I was informed that I had undergone surgery. On April 6, Rasel and his associate Sumon relocated me to the hotel in Jasola. Rasel obtained my bank account details and deposited 4 lakh takas in it but confiscated my passport. My visa had expired in the interim and Rasel told me that I would no longer be employed and instructed me to return to Bangladesh.""S, the third Bangladeshi, suffered a similar experience. He was contacted by a person named Aronno on Facebook, who promised him a job in India with a stipend during training. He was asked to undergo extensive medical tests and 49 tubes of blood were drawn from him over six days. S said, ""I was administered something that made me feel weak and I lost consciousness. I woke up to find my kidney missing. I was told I could live with one kidney without any problem. I was paid 4.5 lakh takas.""The trio has returned to Bangladesh with their tales of horror.

Yograj's remarks highlight a longstanding grievance, alleging that Dhoni's influence curtailed Yuvraj's career, despite his crucial contributions to Indian cricket, particularly in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup under Dhoni's captaincy.After the recent remarks by Yograj, a video of his son Yuvraj has gone viral, in which the World Cup-winner was saying that his father has ‘mental issues'.Yuvraj, India's 2011 World Cup hero, expressed concern over his father's various statements, suggesting that his father has ""mental issues"" and is unwilling to accept it. Yuvraj made these comments during a podcast, signaling his discomfort with his father's persistent accusations.""I think my father has mental issues and he just doesn't want to accept it,"" Yuvraj had said in a podcast.Yuvraj's cricket career, spanning 17 years, was marked by significant achievements, including pivotal roles in India's victories in the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup.However, after 2014, his appearances for the national team diminished, with his final international match being in 2017 against the West Indies. Yograj attributes this decline to Dhoni's influence on the team's selection decisions.In a recent interview on the Zee Switch YouTube channel, Yograj expressed his deep resentment towards Dhoni, stating: ""I won't forgive MS Dhoni. He should look at his face in the mirror. He is a very big cricketer, but what he has done against my son can never be forgiven in life. I have never forgiven anyone who has wronged me, and I never will, even if they are family.

The plea was mentioned before a division bench of Justices B P Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla for urgent hearing.The bench agreed to hear it on Wednesday. Ranaut, who has directed and co-produced the film besides playing the lead role of former prime minister late Indira Gandhi, on Monday accused the CBFC of stalling certification to delay the release.Scheduled for release on September 6, the biographical drama is caught up in controversy after Sikh organisations including the Shiromani Akali Dal objected, accusing it of misrepresenting the community and getting historical facts wrong.Kangana took to Twitter to express her frustration. She stated that despite rumors claiming the film had received its censor certificate, the certification process had been halted due to threats received by CBFC members. She alleged that there was pressure not to depict certain historical events and figures, such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the Punjab riots.The controversy began after the trailer for Emergency was released, which featured Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a controversial figure in the Khalistan movement. This portrayal led to legal action from the Delhi unit of the Shiromani Akali Dal and strong reactions from Sikh organizations like the Akal Takht and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).","Zee Entertainment Enterprises, co-producer of Kangana Ranaut's upcoming film ""Emergency"" filed a petition in Bombay high court to seeking a direction to the Central Board of Film Certification to issue the film's certificate.

Haryana assembly elections: Congress-AAP explore 'win-win alliance' to consolidate Lok Sabha gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana-assembly-elections-congress-aap-explore-win-win-alliance-to-consolidate-lok-sabha-gains/articleshow/113068469.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress, which is exploring a ""win-win alliance"" with the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) in Haryana, on Wednesday set deadline for Arvind Kejriwal's party to finalise the seat-sharing deal. The Congress is also in talks with other parties, including Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party, as it explores the possibility of contesting the elections under the banner of opposition's INDIA bloc.""We are in talks for an alliance with AAP and are exploring a ""win-win situation"" for both the parties. The alliance should benefit both of us and we hope to finalise seat-sharing deal in a day or two. If the talks do not succeed in a day or two we will leave it,"" AICC in-charge of Haryana Deepak Babaria said.The Congress leader refused to share the details of ongoing negotiations but confirmed that AAP would be given seats in single-digit. According to reports, AAP has sought 10 assembly seats, but the Congress is not ready to give that many seats.""It will be a very small number, in single digit,"" Babaria said when asked about the number of seats the Congress was ready to give to Kejriwal's party.Congress and AAP, which share a blow hot and cold political relations, initiated discussions for a possible alliance at the behest of Rahul Gandhi, who wanted to ensure that opposition votes were not divided in Haryana. The alliance move comes as a surprise as both the parties have in the past made it clear that their association under INDIA banner was limited only to Lok Sabha elections. In fact, the state units of both the parties have spoken against any alliance at the state level. Punjab chief minister and senior AAP leader Bhagwant Singh Mann has gone to the extent of alleging that Congress is in collusion with BJP in Haryana.So, why are both the parties now trying for an alliance?The Congress is upbeat about its prospects in the state after the party's success in the recent Lok Sabha elections in which the grand old party wrested 5 Lok Sabha seats from the BJP. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won 10 seats with a vote share of 58%, while the Congress could not open its account with 28% of the votes. The AAP, meanwhile. could manage only .36% of the voteshare.In the assembly elections later in 2019, the BJP lost majority as it won 40 seats in the 90-member assembly with a voteshare of 36.49%. This was 7 less than its 2014 tally. The Congress, meanwhile, increased its tally to 31 seats from 15 in 2014 with 28% voteshare. The AAP, with a .48% of voteshare, lost deposit in all the 46 seats it contested. The BJP did manage to form a government with the help of Dushyant Chautala's JJP, but the saffron party's prospects in the state did not improve. The saffron party made a course correction ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections replacing Manohar Lal Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini as the state's chief minister in March this year.However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP's tally was reduced to 5 seats and its vote share dipped to 46.11%. The Congress, on the other hand, consolidated its gains as it won 5 seats and increased its voteshare to 43.67%. The AAP also increased its presence in the state registering a voteshare of nearly 4%.The Congress would want to consolidate its gains further and not take any chances. By ensuring that the INDIA bloc contests together, Congress will hope to prevent any possible division of anti-BJP votes. Also the party would hope to benefit from AAP's influence in seats bordering Delhi where Arvind Kejriwal has a fairly strong presence.The AAP, which saw its vote share increase in the last Lok Sabha elections in alliance with the Congress, had earlier announced to contest all the 90 seats in the state. However, with Arvind Kejriwal in jail, the party perhaps realises that it can make only limited gains if it contests alone. A continued alliance with the Congress may help Kejriwal's party open its account in the state assembly.No wonder, the two parties hope that an alliance will be a win-win situation for both of them.But the BJP has been quick to target Congress over its alliance move. BJP leader Anil Vij has claimed that the Congress lacks strength to contest Haryana elections on its own so it is ""cosying up"" to the AAP. Political attacks notwithstanding, the fact remains that Congress and AAP are averse to any alliance in states where the two parties perceive themselves as strong contenders to power - like in Delhi and in Punjab.","Congress is exploring a ""win-win alliance"" with the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) in Haryana. The Congress is also in talks with other parties, including Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party. Both the parties have in the past made it clear that their association under INDIA banner was limited to Lok Sabha elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113071000,imgsize-921747,width-400,resizemode-4/113071000.jpg"

The drones were primarily meant for deployment along the northern borders with China.The MoD's department of defence production has also asked industry bodies Ficci, CII and Assocham to ""sensitise and caution"" their member companies from procuring Chinese components for drones and other related equipment.Amid the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now, the armed forces have gone in for the procurement of a wide array of drones. These range from nano, mini and micro drones to kamikaze, logistics, armed swarms and fighter-size MALE (medium-altitude, long-endurance) and HALE (high-altitude, long-endurance) UAVs.Maj General Mann said the Army will host the 'Him-Drone-A-Thon' for domestic companies to showcase their ""drone solutions for high-altitude areas"" at Wari La, near Leh, on Sept 17-18.""For drone operations, a rarefied atmosphere results in reduced lift and degraded engine performance, which are further accentuated by extreme cold temperatures and high wind speeds.

Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) personnel could be relieved from checking ticket details & matching them with photo I cards at terminal entry to allow passenger access — something that can be done by private agency guards — so that the former can focus completely on keeping airports secure.And the exhaustive upto eight-hour shifts that most personnel perform at airports could be reduced to ensure a fully alert watch.Govt sources say the Union home ministry had some time back set up a committee under recently retired IPS officer M A Ganapathy, an expert in aviation security , to study the existing security setup at airports and recommend changes. They add the committee has submitted its recommendations to the Govt which, if accepted and implemented, will lead to less visible but more effective security at airports.At present uniformed personnel in large numbers are deployed at terminals. The panel is learnt to have sought a mix of uniformed and plain clothes security personnel as that would reduce the unease among general public and at the same time enhance security. Airport security , the report is learnt to have stressed, must be inconspicuously foolproof.Govt sources say the committee is not in favour with continuing the long duration (upto eight-hour) shifts of security personnel as that leads to fatigue and less alertness, apart from negatively impacting their health. It has recommended shorter periods of duty to ensure more alert personnel who are the first responders in any crisis and have to hold fort till backup reaches the location. The committee has also recommended sufficient deployment of personnel — armed with night vision devices and thermal sights — along perimeter wall and land side (the terminal entry point side).The report is learnt to have suggested doing away with multiple tasks that security personnel are assigned with — like checking ticket details and matching them with passengers’ I cards to allow them terminal entry. It reportedly points out security personnel should specialise in one task to manage at a time to avoid distractions. Taking away the task of checking tickets and I cards will free up personnel for providing security cover at terminal entry points.Most importantly, the report has recommended setting up of a dedicated airport security group for all airports in the country comprising of personnel from CISF and state police forces. The report has called for ensuring work-life balance and better facilities, including accommodation, for personnel. And it has suggested holding annual validation tests to check the skill set of personnel deployed at airports and taking off duty those who fail from the same.Govt sources say the report is under consideration and will be implemented after consultation with all stakeholders.",CISF personnel could be relieved from checking ticket details & matching them with photo I cards at terminal entry to allow passenger access.

President approval

Amid ongoing widespread protest across the nation for the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal Assembly on Tuesday passed the Aparajita Woman and Child Bill (West Bengal Criminal Laws and Amendment) Bill 2024.The bill passed by the Mamata Banerjee government, proposes stringent punishments, including the death penalty, for convicted rapists, especially in cases where the crime results in the victim’s death or leaves them in a vegetative state.The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, recently introduced criminal law by the central government.Those convicted of severe crimes could face death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. It also includes provisions for harsher sentences for repeat offenders, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.The bill provides quicker investigations, with a new three-week deadline for cases to be completed, a significant reduction from the current two-month period. However, an extension of up to 15 days could be granted under specific conditions.Additionally, the bill aims to establish a special task force called the ""Aparajita Task Force"" at the district level, led by a deputy superintendent of police. This task force would focus on handling these serious cases with the necessary resources and expertise to reduce the trauma for victims and their families.Special courts will also be set up to try these cases, and publishing any details about court proceedings without permission could result in imprisonment for up to five years, along with a fine. The bill, which will be introduced by State Law Minister Moloy Ghatak, is expected to be discussed in the state assembly soon.Criminal law in India falls under the concurrent list, meaning both state and central governments can legislate on the subject. However, for the Aparajita bill to be enacted, it must receive the President's approval.","The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023. Those convicted of severe crimes could face death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole.
