"Greenhouse gas levels surge and hit a new record in 2023, WMO warns of long-term global warming threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/greenhouse-gas-levels-surge-and-hit-a-new-record-in-2023-wmo-warns-of-long-term-global-warming-threat/articleshow/114713343.cms,"NEW DELHI: The year 2023 was not only the warmest on record but also witnessed another record-high surge in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, committing the planet to rising temperatures for many years to come, according to an annual bulletin of the World Meteorological Organisation released on Monday.It also cautioned that carbon dioxide (CO2) is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than at any time during human existence, having risen 11.4% in just 20 years. WMO said the last time the Earth experienced a comparable CO2 concentration of was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degree Celsius warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.“Another year. Another record. This should set alarm bells ringing among decision makers. We are clearly off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degree Celsius and aiming for 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.Noting that these are more than just statistics, she said, “Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet.”The WMO bulletin, released ahead of the upcoming UN climate conference (COP29), shows that the globally-averaged surface concentration of CO2 reached 420 parts per million (ppm), methane 1,934 parts per billion, and nitrous oxide 336.9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023. “These values are 151%, 265% and 125% of pre-industrial (before 1,750) levels,” it said, noting that these are calculated on the basis of the long-term observations within the Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.According to the bulletin that reports on GHG concentrations rather than on emission levels, the CO2 level has increased 11.4 % (42.9 ppm) above the level of 377.1 ppm recorded in 2004. CO2 is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 64% of the warming effect on the climate.The long-term CO2 increase is mainly due to fossil fuel combustion but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The surge in 2023 was also contributed by El Nino — a climate pattern associated with unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean — as during such years drier vegetation and forest fires reduce the efficiency of land carbon sink.Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas which remains in the atmosphere for about a decade, on the other hand, accounts for about 16% of the warming effect of long-lived GHG. The third one, nitrous oxide, is both a powerful GHG and ozone depleting chemical, accounting for about 6% of the radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases with the remaining 14% being contributed by other polluting gases.","The year 2023 was not only the warmest on record but also witnessed another record-high surge in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable CO2 concentration of was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degree Celsius warmer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114713420,imgsize-1660001,width-400,resizemode-4/114713420.jpg"

Census 2021 to resume in 2025: Digital implementations and major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-2021-to-resume-in-2025-digital-implementations-and-major-changes/articleshow/114712233.cms,"The process of conducting Census 2021 , on hold since 2020, could begin in 2025, sources told TOI on Monday. The population figures to be thrown up by the much-delayed and keenly-awaited census will form the basis for delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies — due after 2026 and which will also involve earmarking seats to be reserved for women, besides Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — likely to follow in 2027-28.If the decadal pattern of previous census exercises is retained, the next census cycles may fall due in 2035, 2045 and so on. Sources, however, said there is no clarity yet on conducting a caste census — a demand made by allies like JD(U) and TDP as well as the opposition parties — possibly by adding a ‘caste’ field in the houselisting schedule.The Census 2021 houselisting schedule, notified in January 2020, comprises 31 fields sans ‘caste’.Though sources had earlier indicated that a decision on census was expected shortly, the schedule for National Population Register (NPR) updation, which was to be done alongside the first stage of Census — houselisting and housing operations — has not been notified yet. Even the schedule for the second stage of Census 2021 — the population enumeration phase — has not been notified.The 84th amendment to the Constitution of India had placed a freeze on delimitation of parliamentary and assembly seats until 2026, apart from requiring the next delimitation process to be done based on figures of the first census to be undertaken after 2026. A census beginning in 2025, which will put out the population figures in March 2026, may not fulfil this criteria for fresh delimitation, unless the 84thamendment is revisited, a former officer at the Office of Registrar General of India (ORGI) told TOI.The deadline for freezing the boundaries of administrative units like districts, tehsils, villages etc — a mandatory procedure prior to start of census — was repeatedly extended after Census 2021 exercise, due to begin in April 2020, was deferred due to Covid outbreak. However, no extension order was issued after June 30, 2024.Usually, the preparatory process for census — which comprises houselisting and housing phase, usually undertaken between April 1 and September 30, followed by the population enumeration phase taken up in February of the following year — begins with a pre-test in the year preceding the start of census. This pre-test for Census 2021 was conducted in August-September 2019.“The census process has undergone major a technical updation since...the next census will be the first digital census and will allow respondents to self-enumerate at both the houselisting and the population enumeration stage. All replies to the census questionnaire will be uploaded on the dedicated Census portal,” said an officer. A source told TOI that the Census portal is still being readied. “Since the processes have undergone a technical overhaul, the requirement for a fresh pre-test may be considered, even though the app and the software are being tested internally. The enumerators need to be well versed with the new processes and the census app,” said an former Census officer.","Census 2021 exercise, due to begin in April 2020, was deferred due to Covid outbreak.

The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor’ by 6pm, with an AQI of 299, as winds picked up. However, it’s likely to remain ‘very poor’ over the next few days and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali.Wind direction on Monday was south-easterly, but the met department’s forecast shows it is likely to change to north-westerly on Diwali. North-westerly winds are favourable for transport of smoke from stubble burning sites to Delhi.Experts said winds turn calm during the night time, causing accumulation of pollutants, while light winds prevail during the daytime. However, on Monday, wind speed increased, leading to dispersion of pollutants.“Winds play an important role in dispersion of pollutants in the absence of any significant weather activity like rain, which washes them out. The average wind speed during the daytime on Monday was 15-18 kmph,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice chairman, Skymet Meteorology.The air quality is likely to stay ‘very poor’ till Wednesday and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali if there are added emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning. “The outlook for the subsequent six days from Thursday is that the air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category,” said the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.CAQM, which reviewed the air quality in NCR Friday, directed Delhi govt and NCR states to ensure strict implementation of the SC order on firecrackers and their respective regulations. It directed agencies to work in coordination to ensure AQI levels don’t compel the necessity to invoke further stages of GRAP.“NCR states and Delhi govt were directed to augment the capacity and intensify the use of mechanised road sweeping and sprinkling of water, identify more highrises for installation of anti-smog guns, and deploy nodal officers to address air pollution from hotspots. The strict implementation of SC orders and orders on firecrackers was highlighted, in view that festivals this year coincide with the peak paddy harvesting season in northern India,” CAQM said Monday.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature stood at 34.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal while the minimum settled at 20.4 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.","The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor’ by 6pm, with an AQI of 299.

A white Skoda Fabia car bearing registration number stopped next to their vehicle.There were five men - Nasir Hyder alias Nasir, Shafeeq Ahammed alias Shafiq, Shoyeb alias Shaikh Kalfan, Mohammed Hafeez alias Hafiz and Mohammed Ishq Soudh alias Soudh — in the car. They told Trisha to get out of her car.Trisha tried to run but was caught by the men and forcibly made to sit in the rear seat of their car. They even bundled Ranjith onto the rear seat. The car traversed various roads for an hour, during which Nasir started sexually harassing Trisha.At last, they stopped the car on the side of a railway track. Ranjith was taken out of the vehicle by others, while Nasir raped Trisha after threatening to kill her friend if she didn't cooperate. The ordeal went on for 15 minutes. Later, the gang released both of them.After learning about the sexual abuse of Trisha, her friends started searching for the miscreants' car in Pulakeshinagar. On July 12 of that year, they found the vehicle near a gym on MM Road.After waiting for hours, they managed to catch a man who came to take the car and took him to the police station.The same night, Trisha went to Pulakeshinagar police station to lodge a complaint of kidnap, sexual assault and molestation. The police officers dictated her complaint and made mention of only molestation.The matter reached then police commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar, who suspended Pulikeshinagar police inspector Mohammed Raffi.Later, police took a fresh statement from the girl and invoked appropriate sections of the law.

She got a call asking her to withdraw the complaint and she changed her number. Even I got calls and was pressured to get her to withdraw the complaint. She did not relent."" Trisha is now working for a private firm.Public prosecutor Savitha D Ratan said the collection and matching of DNA samples played a crucial role in securing the convictions.The case was meandering till 2022 as only eight witnesses had deposed till then.

This is a slight improvement from Sunday's AQI of 356.The Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) reported that the AQI at Anand Vihar was 357 at 7am, which is in the 'very poor' category but a drop from 405 recorded on Sunday. The AQI near the Akshardham temple was 357, worse than yesterday's 261 at 7am.SAFAR predicts that even with the firecracker ban in effect until January 1, air quality is likely to remain 'Very Poor' due to firecrackers and stubble burning. ""The meteorological conditions are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants,"" stated SAFAR.Vansh Aggarwal, a student in Delhi, called for the government to use ""new techniques and innovation"" to tackle pollution. ""There are many reasons for the increase in pollution including vehicle and industrial pollution. Even though it is said that it is increasing due to Diwali, but there are a lot of reasons for it, it would be wrong to attribute it to just Diwali. There should be a proper system to tackle the issue of pollution,"" he said.Another resident, Sukhram, described having health issues due to pollution.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a major shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.



BRICS Leader's Summit In Kazan

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.India has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.","U.S. sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

"US, France & Armenia top three buyers of Indian defence exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-france-armenia-top-three-buyers-of-indian-defence-exports/articleshow/114666748.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India shedding its hesitations in exporting lethal arms to other countries, Armenia has emerged as its biggest client of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, among others.The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India, which chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24, official sources said on Sunday.Indian public and private sector companies are now exporting a wide range of arms, ammunition and fuses to around 100 countries, which also include some complete weapon systems and platforms like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Dornier-228 aircraft, artillery guns, radars, Akash missiles , Pinaka rockets, and armoured vehicles, the sources added.The exports to the US, however, mainly consist of sub-systems and components, which include global defence majors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin sourcing fuselage, wings, and other parts of aircraft and helicopters from India as part of their global supply chain networks as well as offset commitments.The Tata Boeing Aerospace venture in Hyderabad, for instance, is making the fuselage and secondary structures for Apache attack helicopters. “France, in turn, is importing a lot of software and electronic equipment,” a source said.The former Soviet Republic of Armenia, on its part, has inked a flurry of deals with India over the last four years for import of ‘finished products’ like missiles, artillery guns, rocket systems, weapon-locating radars, bullet-proof vests, and night-vision equipment as well as a wide variety of ammunition and artillery shells. Some of these deals were inked even during Armenia’s clash with Azerbaijan — which has close ties with Turkey and Pakistan — over Nagorno-Karabakh, as reported by TOI earlier.Armenia has become the first foreign customer for the indigenously-developed Akash air defence missiles, which have an interception range of 25 km, while other countries like Brazil are even keen on co-production and co-development of advanced versions of the system. “Brazil wants an inter-governmental agreement on it…talks are underway,” another source said.Similarly, after India clinched the $375-million contract in Jan 2022 for the export of three BrahMos anti-ship coastal missile batteries to the Philippines, other Asean countries as well as some Gulf nations are increasingly showing interest in acquiring the precision-strike missiles that India has co-developed with Russia.India, of course, continues to remain in the strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 9.8% of the total global imports in the 2019-2023 time-frame.The country, however, is now progressively expanding its domestic defence-industrial base (DIB) and banning import of some weapon systems under the drive for ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) or ‘Make in India’, while aggressively pushing arms exports.With India’s annual defence production reaching a record high of Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2023-24, the govt has set an ambitious target for it to touch Rs 3 lakh crore by 2028-29, along with arms exports of Rs 50,000 crore.India’s defence-industrial base, apart from the 16 defence PSUs, has now expanded to over 430 licenced companies and 16,000 MSMEs, with around three times increase in value of production since 2014-15. The private sector’s contribution amounts to 21% in this, the official sources said.","The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India.

While Reshma died on the way to the hospital, her two daughters are still under treatment,” said a police officer.Following a complaint from her family members, food safety officials of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, along with Banjara Hills police, tracked down the street vendor from Chintal Basti, Khairatabad. Police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and took into custody two persons from Bihar running the business.During investigation, police found that at least 20 other residents of nearby areas were hospitalised with similar complaints – all after having momos from the same stall.Food safety officials carried out an inspection and found that the establishment was operating without the mandatory FSSAI licence, and that the food was being prepared under unhygienic conditions.“We have collected samples of food articles found at the location and sent them to the state food laboratory for analysis. We have also issued orders to stop the operations. The blood culture and stool test reports of the victims have been collected to determine the exact cause of food poisoning,” said a food safety official.“We have also written to the SHO of Banjara Hills police station to conduct an inquiry and take necessary action against the accused,” he added.","Reshma Begum (31) and her daughters, aged 12 and 14, had momos from a street vendor on October 25. Soon afterwards, the trio started showing signs of severe food poisoning - vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. They did not immediately go to a hospital, assuming a little rest would make them feel better. At least 20 other residents of nearby areas were hospitalised with similar complaints.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114709063,imgsize-920318,width-400,resizemode-4/114709063.jpg"

Union Bank of India, the complainant in the case, has demanded Rs 11,000 crore dues from the accused, alleging that the loans taken by them were laundered through shell entities.The latest attachment includes bank deposits, mutual funds, shares, various landed properties and buildings acquired in the name of shell companies, apart from that of Corporate Power Ltd and the family members of Manoj Jayaswal and others, ED said.The money laundering probe was initiated by the agency based on an FIR registered by the CBI against Corporate Power Ltd and its promoters alleging criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.Union Bank of India had alleged that the accused had submitted manipulated project cost statements to avail loans and also diverted bank funds, causing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs 4,037 crore.

Those entrusted with protecting common people and their investments had abrogated their responsibilities and were indulging in widescale corruption and malpractice, Gandhi alleged. In the video, Khera is seen explaining to Gandhi the conflicts of interest allegations against Buch and how there were powers behind her that were at work, an apparent reference to the Adani Group.Sharing the video, the party said the role of the Sebi chairperson was to maintain the security of the stock market and to ensure that investments of common Indians were not at risk. However, when the chairperson was involved in manipulating the market to benefit a single player, like the Adani Group, everyone's money was at risk, it said.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rahul Gandhi wrote, ""What was Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch taking money from ICICI for?""

Student sets self afire amid Uttarakhand stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/student-sets-self-afire-amid-uttarakhand-stir/articleshow/114707730.cms,"Almora/Dehradun: A 23-year-old MSc student from Almora’s Soban Singh Jeena (SSJ) University set himself on fire on Monday as part of ongoing protests against the state govt’s decision to cancel student union elections in colleges and universities this year.Deepak Lohani , a candidate for the president’s post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest, said doctors.The incident occurred during a protest at Chaughanpata, where Rahul Dhami, the university’s current student union president poured petrol on himself. As police tried to de-escalate the situation, Lohani, also a member of the same students’s group, set himself on fire after dousing himself with petrol. Police quickly extinguished the flames and rushed Lohani to the district hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment.The issue of students’ elections has been simmering for almost a month ever since the deadline given by the state govt to universities for conducting the elections passed. The govt had issued an academic calendar on April 23, directing that student union elections be conducted by Sept 30. However, some of the university administrations failed to organise the elections within the specified time. The matter reached the Uttarakhand high court (HC) where a PIL was filed requesting the HC to intervene in getting the student union elections to be held. However, the PIL was dismissed on Oct 24 after the HC accepted the state govt’s contention that it is too late into the academic session to hold the elections.In Almora, student organisations had given the call for a protest rally in the Chaughanpata area where they intended to burn effigies of state education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. This came as Amit Bisht, an NSUI member, announced on Saturday that he would self-immolate if demands were not met by Monday. The protest quickly escalated, leading to Dhami and Lohani’s self-immolation attempts. They warned the govt “not to test their patience” and vowed to keep fighting saying they will “force the state to yield”.Dhan Singh Rawat said, “We have sought response from the universities. A double bench of the HC had passed the order to not go against the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee, which says that student union elections should be held between six to eight weeks after a new academic session starts. Now the students may approach Supreme Court to challenge the HC’s order because universities cannot go against it or the Lyngdoh Committee.”Meanwhile, students from other districts also converged in Dehradun on Monday and marched from Congress Bhawan in the state capital to the secretariat. Another group of students from colleges in Dehradun also held a “funeral march” for Rawat by taking out a procession from DAV college to the secretariat.Students said that the last polls were also held after a two-month delay, making the decision to cancel it this year an “undemocratic move”.“If the admissions were postponed and the last admission was conducted till Sept 25, then preparation should have been made to postpone the elections too,” said Pradeep Singh Tomar, national coordinator (Uttarakhand), NSUI. Earlier, on Oct 18, angry over the college’s failure to announce the date for student union elections, three students from Haldwani’s Moti Ram Babu Ram Government Post Graduate College had climbed on the roof of the principal’s office and threatened self-immolation after pouring diesel on themselves. Later, the students issued an apology for their act.Elsewhere in Dehradun, students have set up tents outside DAV College and Dayanand Brijendra Swarup College, where they have been camping since Friday. Several colleges in the district have also been forced to shut down due to the agitation.","Deepak Lohani, a candidate for the president’s post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest.

Not a single witness was examined in the enquiry, the HC pointed out.Yadav was a BDA revenue officer in 2015 when he was accused of making some changes to the lease deed of a piece of land at ISBT-Bhopal which caused financial loss to BDA. He was suspended and issued a notice in 2016. Yadav replied to the notice and moved HC, challenging the action against him.HC asked Yadav to approach the BDA appellate authority, which upheld the order to sack him without giving him a hearing, his petition stated. After hearing both sides, Justice Dwivedi cited an HC order stating: ""The doctrine of proportionality exists in India from time immemorial. It is applied by courts in criminal cases on a regular basis. The principle is that one cannot be visited with an extreme order/punishment which is not commensurate with the conduct/misconduct /offence.""Citing an SC order, the HC said that getting a copy of the enquiry report is the right of the delinquent when the enquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority, but in this case, the petitioner was neither given the enquiry report nor told why. Thereby, the petitioner was denied a reasonable opportunity to prove his innocence.","Vijay Singh Yadav was a BDA revenue officer in 2015 when he was accused of making some changes to the lease deed of a piece of land at ISBT-Bhopal.
