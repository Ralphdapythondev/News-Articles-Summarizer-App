NEW DELHI: Opposition INDIA bloc , including the Congress, DMK and communist parties, have called for a(strike) in Puducherry on Wednesday.The dawn-to-duskhas been called to protest against the rise in power tariff by the AINRC-BJP-led coalition government in the Union territory.The opposition has claimed that the government's move to introduce pre-paid meters for power supply and privatise power distribution would cripple the farmers of the fair supply of electricity.Congress's Puducherry unit chief V Vaithilingam , who also happens to be Puducherry Lok Sabha MP , has sought the cooperation of all sections of the people for the successful conduct of Wednesday's bandh.The opposition has claimed that privatisation of power distribution would lead the private players to charge an unfair amount and hold consumers to ransom with much-hiked prices.The INDIA bloc stated that there was no inconvenience now when the Department of Electricity is supplying the power. All department assets would be placed at the disposal of the private sector if the power supply becomes the prerogative of the private entrepreneurs, reported news agency PTI.Earlier, speaking at a similar protest organised by the INDIA bloc, DMK's R Siva regretted that the AINRC-BJP coalition government had failed to learn its lesson from the Lok Sabha defeat.Puducherry's former chief minister and senior Congress leader V Narayanasamy has also warned that the INDIA alliance would hold a series of protests if the government refuses to withdraw the hike in power tariff and dropped its proposal to privatise the electricity department.In view of the protest, classes will be suspended today (Wednesday) for standards 1 to 8 in all government and private schools in the Puducherry region.

: Camps to be set up from this week

NEW DELHI: In a move that will simplify the transfer of ownership rights of agricultural land in 174-plus 'declared urban villages', lieutenant governor V K Saxena announced Tuesday the opening of mutation on the basis of inheritance. He said the decision will impact lakhs of residents who had been denied this natural right from 2010.""I have been frequently visiting villages of the Capital and repeatedly received demands from every single village.Several civic society organisations had requested the opening of the process for mutation... A delegation of seven MPs from Delhi too had given a representation,"" Saxena said at a DDA event in Mangolpuri industrial area. ""From Tuesday, mutation of agricultural land in the urbanised villages of Delhi on the basis of inheritance has begun by revenue authorities as it used to be done earlier.""To roll out the process, camps will be set up in villages from this week, starting with 12 villages on Friday. An official said no amendment will be required in Delhi Development Act to implement the process.The 174-odd villages were declared urbanised from 2017 onwards. However, the process of transferring the title or ownership of the land to family members was stopped as the villages were urbanised and transferred to DDA. Officials argued that post-urbanisation, the Delhi Land Revenue Act, under which mutation is done, was no longer applicable to them.Bhupinder Bazad , president of the master plan committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, welcomed the decision. ""We were holding protests at two places in Delhi, including Daulatpur village, and allowing mutation was among other prominent demands. Our demand also included implementing master plan 2041,"" said Bazad.The LG also laid the foundation for supplying PNG to 21 villages, laid the foundation stone for 41 new projects, and inaugurated seven projects spread across 18 villages of northwest Delhi under the Dilli Gramodaya Abhiyan (DGA). The ' NaMo Drone Didi Scheme ' was also launched to empower women and help them earn livelihood for their families.To date, 573 projects worth Rs 523 crore have been sanctioned under the DGA scheme, with funds of about Rs 960 crore transferred to DDA for development works in various villages. Of these, 89 are being executed by DDA. While DDA is the nodal agency, it is working in sync with various civic agencies like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Irrigation and Flood Control.The developmental works launched on Tuesday will cover villages across northwest Delhi, under the subdivisions of Kanjhawala, Rohini, and Saraswati Vihar. Projects to be taken up include renovation, repair, and upgrade of chaupals, public buildings, baarat ghar, community halls, roads, lanes and drain improvement works, and repair and renovation of cremation grounds.","Lieutenant governor V K Saxena announced Tuesday the opening of mutation on the basis of inheritance.

Among the poets and storytellers, Saadat Hasan Manto had roots in this pretty town cradled by the towering Pir Panjal range in south Kashmir's Anantnag district.Dooru is currently drawing attention not for its rich literary history, but for politics, as J&K gears up for its first assembly polls in a decade.Among the ten candidates vying for Dooru assembly constituency is AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir , the nominee of National Conference-Congress alliance.Mir, a two-time legislator, faces competition from PDP 's Mohammad Ashraf Malik and Independents backed by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami and Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party . The entry of former separatists as Independents might shake things up for Mir, who is also a former J&K Congress president and minister.The significance of the battle for Dooru can be gauged by the fact that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi kicked off his party's J&K election campaign here with a rally, while party president Mallikarjun Kharge announced five guarantees for the Union Territory if the alliance is elected to office.Mir has focused his campaign on local issues, saying: ""We had approved a cable car project here, but the PDP-BJP govt shifted it to Pahalgam.""NC and Congress have historically dominated the constituency, winning six of the seven assembly elections since 1977. Mir won in 2002 and 2008, while the seat went to PDP in 2014 when Syed Farooq Ahmad Andrabi, brother of party founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, defeated Mir.In the 2023 delimitation process, Dooru saw an additional 40,000 voters added, bringing the total to 116,749. This expanded electorate could play a vital role in determining the poll outcome.In this summer's LS polls, NC's Mian Altaf secured victory in the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency, which includes Dooru assembly segment. Altaf defeated PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, gaining nearly 30,000 votes compared to Mufti's 9,802 from Dooru.Political analysts are optimistic, saying the NC-Congress combine stands a good chance in absence of prominent rivals. However, it remains to be seen whether the NC vote base will shift to Mir.The constituency votes in first phase.

Development, Welfare Atishi's Priorities

NEW DELHI: The frontrunner was the chosen one. In an expected turn of events, the AAP legislative party on Tuesday elected finance and education minister Atishi , 43, as its leader, paving the way for her to become the eighth chief minister of Delhi.Outgoing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal later met lieutenant governor VK Saxena at Raj Niwas along with his council of ministers - Atishi, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Imran Hussain - to submit his resignation.Chief minister -designate Atishi then submitted a letter to stake her claim to form govt. She will remain at the helm for a maximum of five months in this term if the assembly polls are held as per schedule in Feb 2025.""Now, Atishi steps up to lead Delhi till the upcoming elections, carrying the weight of both CM Arvind Kejriwal's vision and the national capital's future,"" said AAP in a statement.AAP functionaries said an assembly session will be convened on Sept 26 and 27, and the new govt under Atishi will prove its majority. This is a mere formality, considering AAP's brute majority of 59 legislators in a 70-member House. Three MLAs have resigned from AAP in the past five months.Leaving Raj Niwas, Atishi told reporters: ""Had it been any other CM, he would have immediately sat on the CM's chair after coming out of jail. No one in the world would have taken a decision like Kejriwal ji (to step down).""""This is an emotional moment for the party and the people of Delhi. At the same time, the people of Delhi have resolved to make Arvind Kejriwal chief minister again. Till elections are held, I will be looking after Delhi,"" she added.Atishi will be the second youngest to become the CM after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (1952-55) who was just shy of 34 when he was sworn in as CM. She will also be the third woman chief minister of the capital.Her name was proposed by Kejriwal at the meeting of the legislative party, which was held at his camp office at Flag Staff Road. It was unanimously accepted by all legislators.Kejriwal had on Monday held one-on-one meetings with members of AAP's political affairs committee, including all ministers, to seek their view on prospective successors.Kejriwal had announced his decision to step down on Sunday, in less than 48 hours of his release from Tihar Jail after getting bail in the excise policy case. He had told party workers that he would sit in the CM's chair only after obtaining a ""certificate of honesty"" from the electorate in the upcoming polls. He had ruled out deputy CM Manish Sisodia , who was also in jail for over 17 months in the same case, taking over from him. Kejriwal had also urged Election Commission of India to hold elections in Delhi in Nov.A first-time MLA from Kalkaji, Atishi forayed into electoral politics in 2019 when she unsuccessfully contested against BJP's Gautam Gambhir. In 2020, she contested the assembly polls from Kalkaji and won. She was inducted into the cabinet only after Sisodia and former health minister Saytendar Jain resigned due to their incarceration in separate cases.She was initially given six departments which later ballooned to 13. While Kejriwal, even during his first stint of 49 days and 2015 onwards, never kept any portfolio with himself, Atishi is likely to hold on to some departments.Officials said the LG will forward Kejriwal's resignation and Atishi's claim for forming govt to the President and to the Union ministry of home affairs. Once the approvals are received, Raj Niwas will invite her to take the oath of office.Speaking to reporters, AAP's Delhi convenor Gopal Rai had earlier announced that Atishi had been nominated leader of the legislative party. ""At the meeting, it was unanimously decided that till the next elections, which we want to be held in Oct-Nov, when people make Arvind Kejriwal Delhi CM again with a thumping majority, Atishi will carry out the responsibilities as the new CM,"" Rai said.He added that during her stint as CM, Atishi will have two important responsibilities. ""She will ensure that the development work in Delhi is not stopped despite BJP's opposition and also that all welfare schemes of AAP govt, such as free electricity, water and pilgrimage for senior citizens, continue,"" Rai added.Party functionaries were stressing throughout the day that Atishi as CM was an interim arrangement and that after the polls (if AAP wins), Kejriwal will take charge.Kejriwal did not speak to the media or issue any statement after her resignation. Reposting Sisodia's post on X, Kejriwal wrote, ""All the best to Atishi"" in Hindi.In his post on X, Sisodia said PM Narendra Modi had hatched a dirty political conspiracy and made false allegations against Kejriwal and other AAP functionaries, questioned their integrity, sent them to jail and tried to topple the govt.""Arvind Kejriwal has courageously resigned from the post of CM and announced he will go to the court of people. Today, Atishi has been given the responsibility of the CM of Delhi till the elections,"" Sisodia said on X.","Finance and education minister Atishi will become the eighth chief minister of Delhi.

NC

and PDP

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The mood was sombre but the air was thick with anticipation as authorities shifted to high gear to ensure trouble-free voting and a high turnout during Wednesday’s first phase of the three-part assembly elections in J&K — the first in a decade.Loudspeakers have been switched off and campaign vehicles, having logged hundreds of miles, were garaged during the 48-hour silent period that began Monday.On Tuesday, the only signs of polls were party flags, posters, and security personnel stationed at sensitive locations across J&K’s 24 constituencies — 16 in south Kashmir and eight in Jammu division spread over seven districts on either side of the Pir Panjal range.These elections are expected to set the stage for a political showdown as established politicians, new faces, and rebel candidates vie for influence in J&K’s 90-member assembly. More than 23 lakh voters are eligible to vote in this phase, where 219 candidates, including 90 independents, are in the fray.In Kulgam, CPM ’s Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami is seeking a fifth consecutive term, while AICC general secretary Ghulam Ahmad Mir is eyeing a third term from Dooru. PDP has fielded Iltija Mufti, daughter of party chief Mehbooba Mufti, from Srigufwara-Bijbehara, making her the third generation from her family to contest there.Sakina Itoo of NC is contesting for another term from Damhal Hajipora, while PDP’s Waheed Para, Sartaj Madni, and Abdul Rehman Veeri are key candidates in Pulwama, Devsar, and Shangus-Anantnag, respectively.In Jammu, political veterans are making their bid, including NC’s Sajjad Kitchloo, Khalid Najid Suharwardy, Congress’s Vikar Rasool Wani, and Abdul Majid Wani of Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP). BJP ’s Sunil Sharma and Shakti Raj Parihar are also in the fray, along with independent candidate Ghulam Mohammad Saroori, a three-time MLA who was denied a DPAP ticket after he quit Congress in support of Ghulam Nabi Azad two years ago.Other prominent candidates include former MLA Daleep Singh Parihar (BJP), Firdous Tak, Imtiyaz Shan (PDP), NC’s Pooja Thakur, BJP’s Shagun Parihar, and Mehraj Din Malik of AAP. Shagun’s candidacy is particularly poignant as her father and uncle were killed by terrorists in 2018.Allies NC and Congress are contesting against each other in Banihal, Bhaderwah, and Doda under what they term a “friendly contest”. Rebel NC candidate Pyare Lal Sharma is running as an independent in Inderwal, while BJP rebels Rakesh Goswami and Suraj Singh Parihar are contesting in Ramban and Padder-Nagseni, respectively.The elections in south Kashmir are expected to witness close contests between NC and PDP in several constituencies, although independent candidates could disrupt traditional vote banks. PDP’s Para, who is facing charges in a terrorism case, is locked in a tough battle in Pulwama with Mohammad Khalil Bandh, a former party colleague now running on an NC ticket. The contest is further intensified by the entry of Talat Majid Alie, a former member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami. CPM’s Tarigami also faces a similar challenger in Sayar Ahmad Reshi in Kulgam.A total of 14,000 polling staff will oversee the process at 3,276 polling stations, ensuring smooth conduct of the polls.“Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel are deployed in the districts to maintain security and order during the polling,” an election official said. Authorities have expressed optimism about an excellent turnout, particularly due to efforts such as special polling booths for women, people with disabilities, and nomadic tribe folks. Arrangements were also made for home voting. “We saw remarkable participation, with specially-abled and senior citizens casting their votes,” said the official.These will be the first assembly elections in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019. The previous elections were held in 2014, when the House strength was 87, including four seats from Ladakh. BJP and PDP won 25 seats each in Jammu and Kashmir valley, respectively. NC secured 12 of Kashmir’s 46 seats, while Congress took four. In Jammu’s 37 seats, Congress finished second to BJP with five seats, while NC and PDP won three each. Following the 2023 delimitation exercise, the assembly now has 90 seats, with 47 representatives from Kashmir valley and 43 from Jammu.Voting for 26 seats will be held in the second phase on Sept 25, followed by 40 seats in the final round on Oct 1. Votes will be counted on Oct 8.","More than 23 lakh voters are eligible to vote in this phase, where 219 candidates, including 90 independents, are in the fray.

The reactor is expected to go into operation in Dec, according to information from several sources.Referring to capacity addition, Mohanty told the delegates that the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) has begun commercial operation of two units of the indigenous 700MW pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) at Kakrapar Atomic Power Station in Gujarat in the last one year.“Also, initial fuel loading is complete in another unit of 700MW PHWR at Rajasthan Atomic Power Station,” he said, adding that towards strengthening the fuel supply chain, a green field nuclear fuel complex at Kota in Rajasthan has now entered an advanced commissioning stage, which will mainly cater to the requirement of the forthcoming fleet of indigenously built PHWRs.“As India sets its path to establish itself as a developed nation (Viksit Bharat), the govt of India envisages a significantly greater role for nuclear energy in the next two decades to meet the dual challenges of energy security and balancing climate goals,” Mohanty said.In pursuit of this goal, the govt recently said it will partner with the private sector in developing and setting up compact nuclear reactors — Bharat Small Reactors — which will generate electricity on a smaller scale and have the advantage of being set up faster and be cost-effective, too.Mohanty told the conference that the Heavy Water Board (HWB) is exporting heavy water to several countries for non-power applications, including medical applications and healthcare.“At the dawn of the new era of nuclear renaissance, India stands ready to partner with the agency (IAEA) and other like-minded member states to harness the potential of nuclear energy and contribute to a future defined by growth, innovation, and energy security,” Mohanty said.","India’s first 500MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) near Kalpakkam, close to Chennai, set to become critical.

denial again puts spotlight on

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed criminal proceedings by Nagaland Police against the 30 Army personnel for allegedly killing 13 civilians in a 2021 botched operation to ambush militants in the state's Mon district. It said the Centre had declined sanction, which is mandatory before proceeding against Army personnel under Section 6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.Noting that sanction had been declined since Feb last year, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale said the FIR lodged against the personnel could not survive and also refused to pass any direction for departmental proceedings against them.""The proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs shall remain closed. However, in case sanction is granted at any stage under Sec 6 of the AFSP Act-1958, the proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs may proceed in accordance with law and be brought to a logical conclusion,"" the bench said.The SC bench noted that the Nagaland govt had already approached the court challenging the Centre's decision to reject sanction to prosecute the Army personnel.The denial of sanction has again put the spotlight on Afspa which is resented by local communities who feel that it has been reduced to blanket immunity for the armed forces personnel guilty of atrocities and, worse, killings.The defence establishment and armed forces, however, have strongly argued for continuing with the controversial law, saying it is a necessary shield against harassment through malicious campaigns launched by overground supporters of insurgents.""The learned senior counsel and counsel for the parties had made submissions making allegations and counter-allegations. However, we are not inclined to go into those submissions, as in our opinion, in view of the specific bar contained in Section 6 of the Afspa, which provides that no prosecution, suit, or other legal proceedings can be instituted except with the previous sanction of the central govt with respect to exercise of any power conferred under the said Act, the proceedings based on the impugned FIRs cannot continue any further,"" the bench said.","Court quashes criminal proceedings by Nagaland Police against the 30 Army personnel for allegedly killing 13 civilians in a 2021 botched operation to ambush militants in the state's Mon district.

bulldozer action

: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday put the brakes on 'bulldozer justice' by directing all state governments and their authorities not to carry out any demolition work till Oct 1 without taking its approval. It added that people holding public office must stop glorifying the practice or engage in grandstanding on it.Raising serious concern over bulldozers being used as a punitive tool, which SC said was against the ethos of the Constitution and needed to be subjected to ""judicial oversight"", Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said there was apprehension of its misuse by the executive, which could not act as the judge.However, the bench said that its order would not come in the way of authorities taking action in case of encroachment on roads and public land, and structures built on it could be demolished without notice even if they were religious in nature.SC passed the interim order that would remain valid till the next date of hearing on Oct 1 after it was alleged that razing of houses and commercial property continued unabated in different states even after SC frowned on the practice and agreed to examine a plea for framing guidelines.Senior advocate C U Singh and lawyer Fauzia Shakil brought to the court's notice incidents in Rajasthan's Bhilwara where several shops were recently razed. Senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, pitched in and said targeted demolitions were being carried out.The contention was countered by SG Tushar Mehta who told the court that a narrative was being built that people from a particular community were being targeted by bulldozers, and urged the court not to give credence to it.Mehta said notices were served in 2022 in the case of the demolitions in Rajasthan, adding that in MP, 50% of the 700-odd shops demolished belonged to Hindus.The bench asked the SG why demolitions were ""hurriedly"" carried out in Rajasthan when nothing had been done in the last two years and assured him that it did not get affected or influenced by ""outside noise"". SC said it was not concerned about any community but about law and its implementation, which should be applicable to all. ""Our immediate priority is to streamline the procedure,"" SC said.The court also took strong exception to people holding public office, including ministers, extolling the practice of bulldozer justice and said it may seek response from Election Commission on the issue. ""This glorification, grandstanding and justification of bulldozer has to stop,"" the bench said.The court thereafter passed the interim order and said, ""Till next date, there shall be no demolitions without seeking leave of this court. However, such an order would not be applicable for unauthorised constructions on public streets, footpaths, abutting railway lines or public spaces.""On the previous hearing on Sept 2, the bench had strongly criticised the practice of 'bulldozer justice' by demolishing homes or commercial places just because it belonged to someone who was alleged to have committed an offence and emphasised the need for nationwide guidelines and had sought suggestions from parties.Another SC bench on Sept 12 had said govt authorities indulging in 'bulldozer justice' amounted to running a bulldozer over the laws of the land and had added that alleged involvement in crime was no ground for demolition of a property.""In a country where actions of the state are governed by the rule of law, transgression by a family member cannot invite action against other members of the family or their legally constructed residence. Alleged involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property. Moreover, the alleged crime has to be proved through due legal process in a court of law. The court cannot be oblivious to such demolition threats inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme. Otherwise, such actions may be seen as running a bulldozer over the laws of the land,"" a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and SVN Bhatti had said.","Supreme Court directs all state governments and their authorities not to carry out any demolition work till Oct 1 without taking its approval.

They want equal opportunity with security. If it is a 12-hour shift, let it be for all resident doctors irrespective of their gender. The state govt must correct this circular.""Even though the circular was not mandatory but in the shape of an advisory, Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma said the circular will be amended and these two clauses, objected to by the court and the resident doctors, would be withdrawn.The bench cited the SC's judgment in the Anuj Garg case which involved a challenge to the validity of Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act prohibhiting the employment of women on premises (bars) where people consume liquor or intoxicating drugs. In the 2007 judgment, SC ruled that ""instead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the state should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal consequences of sex differences can be eliminated"".""It is the state's duty to ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to discharge the duty freely in accordance with the requirements of the profession they choose to follow,"" SC had ruled.Deprecating the Delhi govt's opposition to employment of women in bars citing the Jessica Lal murder case, SC had had allowed men and women below the age of 25 to take up jobs in bars, saying these youngsters graduate in hotel management courses at the age of 22 or 23 years and cannot be prohibited from taking employment in the relevant industry.",West Bengal health department issued a circular 10 days after a woman doctor's rape-murder.
