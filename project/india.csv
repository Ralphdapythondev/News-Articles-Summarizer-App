Unified Genomic Chip: PM Modi to launch Unified Genomic Chip and indigenous sex-sorted semen production tech to boost dairy farming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-launch-unified-genomic-chip-and-indigenous-sex-sorted-semen-production-tech-to-boost-dairy-farming/articleshow/113954457.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: In a move that may improve the efficiency of dairy farming and tackle the problem of stray cattle in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will, during his Maharashtra visit on Saturday, launch a Unified Genomic Chip for cattle and an indigenous sex-sorted semen production technology to help farmers multiply high-quality bulls and milch cattle.During this trip, Modi will also release the 18th instalment of financial assistance under the PM-Kisan scheme to over 9.4 crore farmers across the country, amounting to more than Rs 20,000 crore.Tailored for Indian breeds, the Unified Genomic Chip – the 'Gau Chip' for cattle and 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo – will enable farmers to make informed decisions on animal selection by identifying young and high-quality bulls at an early age. On the other hand, the indigenous sex-sorted technology will increase the availability of sex-sorted semen for farmers at a reduced cost for producing only female calves.""Though India has been using sex-sorted technology for producing female calves for a long time, the high cost of imported production technology at Rs 1,000 per dose deters dairy farmers from opting for it, as sometimes animals need multiple doses. The use of indigenous technology will, however, now reduce its cost to Rs 200 per dose,"" said an official in the department of animal husbandry and dairying (DAHD).He said, ""The indigenous technology combined with the Unified Genomic Chip for selecting high-quality and disease-free bulls will not only make the entire effort economically viable for farmers but also substantially reduce the number of non-productive animals who end up as stray on roads and farmlands.""With affordable sex-sorted semen production technology in hand, the DAHD has now planned to produce a minimum of 10 lakh sexed semen doses annually for the ongoing artificial insemination (AI) programme. The IVF technology (commonly known as test tube baby technology) is also being used for this purpose.The sex-sorted semen ensures the birth of only female calves with more than 90% accuracy, whereas the IVF technology makes the process faster. ""Sexed semen of high-grade merit bulls of indigenous breeds will cut short the period of producing desired milch cattle and buffalo. The Unified Genomic Chip will help the process,"" said the official.Launched in February 2019, the PM-Kisan scheme provides Rs 6,000 annually to each landholding farmer family in the country. It is given to them in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each. With the 18th instalment release, the total disbursement under the scheme will exceed Rs 3.45 lakh crore, supporting more than 11 crore farmer families.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a Unified Genomic Chip for cattle and an indigenous sex-sorted semen production technology. The move may improve the efficiency of dairy farming and tackle the problem of stray cattle in the country. Modi will also release the 18th instalment of financial assistance under the PM-Kisan scheme.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113954499,imgsize-845151,width-400,resizemode-4/113954499.jpg"

Being frugal in a world of excess,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/being-frugal-in-a-world-of-excess/articleshow/113935570.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

‘The Psychology of Money’ by Morgan Housel has become a popular topic of conversation after actor Arvind Swamy mentioned it in a recent interview. Unlike many others that glorify risk-taking and quick riches, Housel offers a refreshing perspective on financial discipline.

One of my favourite sections in the book discusses the virtues of modest living. ""There are modest folks with hidden wealth, and flashy people who are just a step away from insolvency."" It reminds me of a lesson I learnt years ago.

While cleaning the loft at my parents’ house, I found a dusty bag of childhood treasures—dolls, a Monopoly set and comic books. At the bottom was a pink piggy bank. My mother had used that piggy bank to teach me my first lesson in financial prudence. I’d fill it with coins and the occasional small denomination notes gifted by visiting relatives. Once, a friend of my dad gave me a 50-rupee note, and I felt like Richie Rich! However, there was a catch—my mother held the key. Whenever I wanted an ice cream or a new bangle from ‘John Fancy Shop’ on Triplicane High Road, Amma would ask a series of questions. If it wasn’t a need, but a want, she’d deny the key.

We also had a clay piggy bank, an undiyal, which had no key. It could be broken open only for emergencies. Each month, Amma made us deposit a ten-rupee note in it, reinforcing the idea that savings should only be used when necessary.

In retrospect, I realised that it was the best financial advice I ever received. My parents lived modestly, despite being relatively well-off compared to our neighbours. My father was a school headmaster, and my mother worked for the central govt. We celebrated festivals and birthdays, but there were unspoken rules; only two new outfits a year excluding school uniforms, and one outing a month, either to a cinema or a restaurant.

When we begged for more clothes or accessories, Amma would point at street children who didn’t get three meals a day. “Buy only if you need it, not to show off,” she’d say.

Her words shaped my own financial habits. When I started managing finances, I created two bank accounts—one for essential spending like the pink piggy bank, and the other like the clay one, reserved for a genuine emergency.

It’s difficult to instil financial discipline today. Our homes are filled with things—bags, food items, gadgets, clothes, shoes. Frugality, once a guiding principle in households, has been replaced by a culture of excess.

RBI’s recently published data indicates a sharp decline of 7 percent in household savings of Indians. Yes, frugality is not just a personal financial strategy, but a societal imperative for sustainability as well. Understanding the difference between needs and wants helps curb unnecessary consumption, which adds little value to our lives.

Tamil poet-saint Thiruvalluvar, known for his wisdom on ethics and love, also gave timeless financial advice. He warned people against living beyond their means:

Alavarindhu Vaazhaadhaan Vaazhkkai Ulapola

Illagi Thondraak Kedum.

Behold the man who doesn’t live modestly within his means,

His life will appear glamorous, but will soon thin and disappear.

His words remind us that modesty is not just about money; it’s about balance. In a world obsessed with more, there is power and freedom in choosing less.

BENGALURU: In a temporary relief for ride-hailing company Ola, a division bench of Karnataka high court on Friday stayed the single-bench order that directed the company to pay a penalty of Rs 5.5 lakh, including legal expenses, to a woman who had filed a complaint under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, (PoSH), alleging Ola had failed to act on her plaint after one of its drivers sexually harassed her.On Sept 30, 2024, the single bench had also ruled that a driver of the transport aggregator is an ""employee"" of the company. However, the senior advocate appearing for Ola argued in court that Ola drivers are not employed by the ride-hailing company.The case dates to August 23, 2018, when a woman rider complained she was sexually harassed by the driver during her ride on an Ola cab from Yelahanka to J P Nagar here. She said she noticed the driver watching a pornographic video clip on his mobile phone, even as he was masturbating.The vacation division bench, comprising Justices S R Krishna Kumar and M G Uma, issued the stay order after senior advocate Dhyan Chinnappa, appearing for M/s ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, the company that runs Ola, argued: ""The single judge/bench concluded that there is an employee-employer relationship.

"Quit ‘armed struggle’ in 1994, have turned Gandhian: Yasin Malik to UAPA Tribunal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-quit-armed-struggle-in-1984-have-turned-gandhian-yasin-malik-in-court/articleshow/113949900.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front -Yasin (JKLF-Y) chairman Yasin Malik , in his affidavit submitted to the UAPA tribunal that reviewed the ban on JKLF-Y, claimed that he gave up “armed struggle” in 1994 as a means to achieve JKLF-Y 's object of establishing a “United Independent Kashmir”, in favour of a “Gandhian way of resistance”.Yasin’s affidavit -- cited in the UAPA Tribunal’s order issued last month and published in the gazette on Thursday, upholding the declaration of JKLF-Y as an ‘unlawful association’ under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, for a further five years -- adds, “through questionable factual assertions”, how top political and govt functionaries at the Centre have, since 1994, engaged with him to explore a peaceful settlement to the Kashmir issue raised by the separatists.Yasin, who founded JKLF-Y in 1988, is a prime accused in the sensational killing of four Indian Air Force personnel at Rawalpora, Srinagar, in 1990, with witnesses having identified him as the main shooter earlier this year. He was also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life in May 2022 in a terror financing case probed by NIA.Yasin, in his reply-cum-affidavit to the tribunal, claimed that he was assured by “various state officials” in the early Nineties that they shall resolve the Kashmir dispute through a meaningful dialogue and that once he initiated a unilateral ceasefire, all cases against him and JKLF-Y members would be taken back. “Subsequently, a unilateral ceasefire was declared in 1994 by him and his organisation and consequently, he was provided bail in all the 32 pending militancy-related cases under TADA and, thereafter, none of the cases were pursued against him in terms of the ceasefire agreement from 1994 till 2018,” records the tribunal’s order.The JKLF-Y boss claimed that while armed militancy was the outfit’s chosen path from 1988 to 1994 to achieve its aim of establishing a United Independent Kashmir by reintegrating PoK, Gilgit, Baltistan with J&K, “after the year 1994, the said efforts were continued through a non-violent struggle”.The Centre, both in its ban notification dated March 15, 2024, as well as through depositions by officers investigating cases against JKLF-Y, maintained that though Yasin had distanced himself from armed resistance in 1994, he did not step back from supporting and sustaining terrorism. “He used his new facade to become one of the most important channels of financial resources for the violent campaign. JKLF-Y continued its anti-national activities and...played a vital role in the riots which broke out during the years 2008, 2010 and 2016,” it was submitted.Yasin sought to dismiss the charge that he had received Rs 15 lakh from terror-financing accused Zahoor Ahmad Watali as “concocted”, but the tribunal in its order noted that he had refused to comment when asked by ED the purpose of receiving this money. On NIA’s charge that he is implicated in over 89 cases of stone pelting post the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016, Yasin said he was in police custody during the violence.Though Yasin claimed JKLF-Y officers in Kashmir were closed since it was first banned in 2019, he admitted that its international branches in over 50 countries are functional and supporting the cause of the outfit. This belies his submission that there is no unlawful activity by JKLF-Y and its cadres since the 2019 ban.The tribunal, in its order confirming the ban on JKLF-Y, said there is no denial to the assertions by witnesses who deposed on behalf of the Union of India, that JKLF-Y has indulged in acts of secessionism and is still committed to secession of J&K from the Indian Union, “which directly and gravely impinges upon the territorial integrity of India”.","Yasin Malik, who founded JKLF-Y in 1988, is a prime accused in the sensational killing of four Indian Air Force personnel at Rawalpora, Srinagar, in 1990.

He owns a 13% stake in Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, which has significantly boosted his position on the wealth index this year.In 2024, Meta's shares surged nearly 70% owing to his rising personal wealth and fueling investors optimistically. This marks a major turn for the company, which laid off 21,000 employees in late 2022 as part of Zuckerberg's cost-cutting strategy—a move seen as pivotal to Meta's recovery.Despite its substantial investments in virtual and augmented reality, investor confidence in Meta remains high.

NEW DELHI: As India prepare to take on New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday, the pressure is on skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and her senior stars to deliver a strong start. With past near-misses haunting the team, most notably their loss to Australia in the 2020 final, the Women in Blue are determined to overcome their mental fragility and aim for a deep run in the tournament.Harmanpreet, likely playing in her last T20 World Cup, has been central to India's rise but has also experienced heartbreak in pivotal moments.The Indian side, brimming with talent, stands toe-to-toe with top contenders like Australia, but unlike the six-time champions, India still lack a major ICC title.The key challenge for India has often been faltering at clutch moments in global events. To combat this, the team held a preparatory camp at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), including counseling sessions to address their mental toughness. However, as any seasoned athlete knows, external help only goes so far, and it will come down to India's ability to execute flawlessly on the field.In their opening match against New Zealand, a team that might not be as formidable as Australia but remains tough and competitive, India will need to be at their best. A victory could signal India’s tactical and mental readiness for the tournament, especially in a group that includes heavyweights like Australia, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.For India to make a strong start, the contributions of senior players are essential. Skipper Harmanpreet, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, and Deepti Sharma are expected to lead from the front.India’s spin-heavy bowling attack could be their trump card, given the likely weariness of the tracks. With only three pacers — Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, and Arundhati Reddy — India will likely depend heavily on their variety of spinners.New Zealand, however, are no pushovers. Led by talismanic skipper Sophie Devine, with seasoned campaigners Suzie Bates, Lea Tahuhu, and Leigh Kasperek, the Kiwis boast a strong core. The presence of young all-rounder Amelia Kerr adds dynamism to their squad, though they might rely heavily on their more experienced players.The highly anticipated opening match of the Indian team will take place on October 4 at 7:30 PM IST at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium , Dubai.Throughout their T20I history , India and New Zealand have faced each other on 13 occasions, with New Zealand holding a statistical edge, winning nine of them. India have just four wins under their belt.On the current form, India have the edge as they have won seven of their last 10 matches, with one no result, whereas New Zealand have lost all their last 10 matches coming into the contest.The Dubai has historically provided a balanced track, with equal opportunities for both batters and bowlers. And for night matches, the Dubai pitch has favoured chasing teams, with dew often playing a role under the lights, making it tougher for bowlers in the second innings.From a fantasy cricket perspective, the pitch report indicates that batting conditions are optimal at the beginning of the innings when the ball is hard and new, more so while batting first. Therefore, selecting the top three batters from both teams can be a strategic advantage in fantasy contests. Additionally, new ball bowlers can use the conditions better before dews make their presence felt..India’s top-order batter is one of the consistent run-scorers in the game and is coming into the contest riding on good form.India’s swashbuckling opener is known for her big shots and can destroy any attack with his aggressive style of batting.the experienced New Zealand all-rounder and captain is a proven match winner and can contribute handsomely with both bat and ball.India squad: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh, Yastika Bhatia (subject to fitness), Pooja Vastrakar, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh Thakur, Dayalan Hemalatha, Asha Sobhana, Radha Yadav, Shreyanka Patil (subject to fitness), Sajana SajeevanUma Chetry (wk), Tanuja Kanwer, Saima Thakor.Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Suzie Bates, Harmanpreet KaurSophie Devine, Deepti Sharma, Amelia KerrRicha GhoshRadha Yadav, Renuka Singh Thakur, Leigh Kasperek.","India take on New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday.

Why NIA and ED are after him

NEW DELHI: The central government on Friday reacted to controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik 's Pakistan visit , calling it ""disappointing and condemnable but not surprising"".Naik, who is wanted in India for hate speech and terror-related charges, was warmly welcomed in Islamabad on October 1 for his month-long visit.""We have seen reports that he (Zakir Naik) has been fitted into Pakistan and warmly welcomed there.It is not surprising for us that an Indian fugitive has received a high-level welcome in Pakistan. It is disappointing and condemnable but not surprising,"" Randhir Jaiswal, minister of external affairs spokesperson told media at a press brief.Naik, who has lived in exile since 2016, also met Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , who praised him for his ""insightful and impactful"" lectures on Islam.Zakir Naik's Pakistan visit was at the invitation of the government and marks his first return to the country in over three decades. He will be delivering lectures in major cities including Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore.Naik fled India in 2016 following allegations of money laundering and promoting extremism , and was granted permanent residency in Malaysia by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. His visit to Pakistan has sparked renewed attention, given his controversial reputation and ongoing legal issues in India.Naik, 58, is the founder of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF). A doctor by profession, he is known for delivering inflammatory lectures in English, unlike many other Islamic preachers who use Urdu or Arabic. He was born on October 18, 1965, to Abdul Karim Naik and Roshan Naik in Mumbai.He attended Kishinchand Chellaram College and then studied medicine at the Topiwala National Medical College, where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS). Naik attended South African Islamic preacher Ahmed Deedatʼs lecture in the late 1980s.Naik is the founder of Peace TV, a channel on comparative religion with a reported audience of over 100 million.It faces a ban in India in connection with alleged money laundering and hate speeches. India also banned IRF in 2016, accusing it of encouraging followers to promote enmity and hatred.He fled India in July 2016 after Bangladeshi authorities claimed that one of the attackers on a cafe in Dhaka was inspired by Zakir Naik. The incident had left 22 people dead.The NIA filed a charge sheet under Section 10 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, which has been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The investigation revealed that Naik is the founding trustee and a member of an “unlawful association” – IRF.","Zakir Naik is wanted in India for hate speech and terror-related charges.

'China rapidly building infrastructure along LAC': IAF chief Amar Preet Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-rapidly-building-infrastructure-along-lac-iaf-chief-amar-preet-singh/articleshow/113936296.cms,"Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh addresses a press conference at Akash Air Force Mess, in New Delhi. (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Chief of air staff (CAS) Air chief marshal Amar Preet Singh on Friday said that China is rapidly building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the Ladakh sector.While addressing a press conference ahead of the Air Force Day, the chief of air staff also said that India too was upgrading infrastructure in the area rapidly.In response to a question, the IAF chief shared his views on China's military growth and India's preparedness in response, saying, ""We have done our analysis. We don't have a design to go offensive unnecessarily. Only when we are pushed will we be doing something. So we have our plans in place. One place we can positively say we are training much better than them. We have exposure much better than them.""Singh acknowledged that India has lagged behind China in terms of technology, and stressed the need for India to catch up in both technology and production rates. ""Because we do come to know through our sources how they train, how many different air forces they interact with and how many do we interact with. So I am very confident that as far as human angle is concerned, as far as our people behind the machine are concerned, we are way ahead of them. As far as technology is concerned, we may be not so good as of now. We have lagged. We were better than them in technology also some time back. But have lagged in that and we need to catch up with it. As far as production rates are concerned, we are way behind. We need to catch up with that. And that will happen over a period of time. It cannot happen overnight,"" Singh added.During the press conference, the air chief marshal also discussed the importance of indigenous weapons systems in tackling future security challenges amidst geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide. Singh said, ""The Indian Air Force should have entire inventory produced in India by 2047.""The IAF chief stressed the importance of domestic manufacturing capabilities, saying, ""When it comes to building the capacity, one is capability, another one is capacity. So building the capacity, it becomes important for our manufacturing agencies to come forward and increase their production rate. When it comes to conflict situations, if you are relying on getting your weapons from outside, there will always be different interests and changing interests which can create a choke point for you.""He further elaborated on the necessity of self-reliance in weapon production , and said, ""If you need to fight the war, you have to have them (weapons) being manufactured in India. You cannot afford to have them being bought and rely on that supply chain. It is imperative that we have these things being produced in India. We can't be stocking up everything forever. These things will have life. If we keep stocking up, we'll have wastage.""The most recent formal disengagement along the LAC occurred in September 2022, when both India and China withdrew troops from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh. Over the past four years, friction points such as Galwan Valley, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and the Gogra-Hot Springs area have seen some progress towards resolution with the establishment of buffer zones along the LAC.","Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh said that China is rapidly building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the Ladakh sector.

Pincer move by forces took

Reds by surprise

RAIPUR: Around 28-30 Maoists were killed in fierce encounters over a 10km range in the jungles of Abujhmarh, in Bastar, on Friday. Police believe at least five senior commanders have been eliminated. It’s the biggest blow to Maoists in Bastar ever, surpassing the Kanker gunfight of April 16 in which 29 cadres were eliminated.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai and Narayanpur SP Prabhat Singh put the Maoist toll at 28, but Dantewada SP Gaurav Rai said around 30 Maoists have been killed and the final count would be known later at night.“Since it’s dark, forces are sanitising the region carefully. Collection of Naxal bodies is taking some time,” Rai said. Singh said the toll could rise. There were specific inputs about presence of at least 50 Maoists.The encounter site stretches over 10 km and gunfights took place at separate locations. There was continuous firing from 1 pm to 9 pm. It was a very courageous operation,” Narayanpur superintendent of police Prabhat Singh said.There were specific inputs about the presence of at least 50 Maoists, including cadres from PLGA Company 6, headed by commander Nandu, the Narayanpur SP said. The forces pinpointed locations in Govel, Nendur and Thulthuli villages in Orccha and Barsur areas. This densely forested region is around 300 km from Raipur and 50 km north of Dantewada. “A joint District Reserve Guards and Special Task Force team walked at least 25 km from Dantewada and Narayanpur to penetrate the Maoist den,” Singh said.The pincer movement took the Maoists completely by surprise and the first gunbattle erupted at around 1 pm. Skirmishes continued into the night, with forces pursuing the fleeing Naxals into the pitch-dark forest.Around 4 pm, the first reports of Maoist casualties came in, and by 6 pm 14 bodies had been found. The toll kept rising. Automatic weapons, including AK-47s and SLRs, and explosives have been seized. The dead Maoists are yet to be identified but, going by the weapons recovered, there could be senior commanders, say sources.“Communication with officers on the spot is difficult. Our forces are expected to return by Saturday evening,” said the Narayanpur SP.CM Vishnu Deo Sai called it a “great success”. “I salute the forces’ indomitable courage. Our fight to end Naxalism will now end only after reaching its conclusion. Our double-engine govt is committed to eliminating Naxalism,” he said.“Till now, 28 bodies have been recovered, and this seems to be one of the biggest operations so far. We have been asking Maoists to give up arms and join the mainstream. Maoism is breathing its last and very soon peace will be restored in Chhattisgarh. Union home minister Amit Shah has visited Chhattisgarh twice and he has vowed that Maoism will be eradicated by March 2026 from the country. As per his commitment, our jawans are fighting with full valour in Chhattisgarh,” he said.As many as 48 Maoists have been shot dead this year in Abujhmarh, an area once considered out of bounds for even the police.","Around 28-30 Maoists were killed in fierce encounters over a 10km range in the jungles of Abujhmarh, in Bastar, on Friday.

Key candidates in fray

BJP vs Congress takes centre stage

AAP relies on Congress, BJP rebels

NEW DELHI: After witnessing the weeks of high-octane poll campaigns for assembly elections, Haryana on Saturday will vote to elect MLAs for the 90-member House.With 1,031 candidates in the fray, electors in Haryana will be polling in a single phase to elect their assembly representatives.Chief electoral officer Pankaj Aggarwal confirmed to news agency IANS that 20,632 polling booths have been set up statewide, including 455 in the Panchkula and Kalka assembly constituencies.Polling will take place from 7 am to 6 pm, and a total of 2,03,54,350 people are eligible to exercise their franchise in the state.In Panchkula, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Himadri Kaushik has briefed paramilitary forces and police personnel on security measures, emphasising the need for heightened vigilance, especially at sensitive polling stations.The poll body has laid down strict guidelines, with a zero-tolerance policy towards negligence during duty.In the high-stakes polls, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is scrambling to save its citadel in the northern state, while the Congress is pushing against the saffron party to regain the ground it lost in 2014.In a bid to make inroads in Haryana, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP has decided to punch above its weight as it is contesting all the seats after its alliance talks with Congress faltered.Dushyant Chautala's Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), earlier BJP's ally, tied up with the Chandrashekhar Ravan's Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram). The alliance is contesting all assembly constituencies in Haryana, with JJP competing on 70 seats while ASP on 20.Two other parties, ex-CM Om Prakash Chautala's INLD and Mayawati's BSP, have entered into a pre-poll alliance, expecting to sway a significant Jat and Dalit votes in its fold.Prominent among those in the fray include chief minister Nayab SIngh Saini (Ladwa), leader of opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda (Garhi Sampla-Kiloi), INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala (Ellenabad), JJP's Dushyant Chautala (Uchana Kalan), BJP's Anil Vij (Ambala Cantt) and O P Dhankar (Badli), AAP's Anurag Dhanda (Kalayat) and Congress's Vinesh Phogat (Julana).Among the independent candidates include Savitri Jindal (Hisar), Ranjit Chautala (Rania) and Chitra Sarwara (Ambala Cantt).This election, there is a drop in the number of women candidates. Only 101 women are contesting for the Haryana election including Ambala's Shakti Rani Sharma and Shalley Chaudhary.As BJP eyes a hat-trick, Congress will look to make a comeback in the state after a decade. Both parties launched aggressive campaigns to win the support of the people of Haryana. As BJP relies on its 10-year development record, Congress is attempting to capitalise on anti-incumbency sentiment and issues such as the farmers' protest and the Agnipath Scheme, which offers short-term recruitment in the armed forces.In the run-up to the assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held four rallies in the state, targeting Congress on various issues, including corruption in land deals, urban-Naxal agenda, reservations, appeasement, dynasty politics and Article 370. On the other hand, Congress' campaign focused on allegations of misgovernance by former CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who led the BJP government in the state for nearly 9 and a half years.In a strategic move ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP replaced Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini as the CM of Haryana.AAP is independently contesting the Haryana assembly elections for the first time. The party has gained momentum in the final stages of campaigning, boosted by the release of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal from jail. AAP, which has fielded candidates for all seats, has offered tickets to disgruntled ticket aspirants from BJP, Congress, and INLD. The party has embraced five rebels from BJP, three from Congress, and one from INLD.AAP has fielded BJP rebels Satish Yadav in Rewari, Sunil Rao in Ateli, Krishna Bajaj in Thanesar, and Jawahar Yadav in Bawaal. Bajaj worked with BJP for around 44 years. The party also nominated Congress rebels Pradeep Jatoli in Pataudi, Bhim Singh Rathi in Radaur, and Adarshpal Gurjar in Jagadhari.According to AAP workers, Gurjar poses a serious threat to Congress candidate Akram Khan. The Jagadhri constituency is likely to witness an interesting fight between three Gurjars: BJP's Kanwar Pal and Congress's Adarsh Pal Singh, who are Hindu Gurjars, and Khan, who is a Muslim Gurjar. Additionally, former INLD spokesperson Ranbir Singh Lohan joined AAP and is now contesting from Narnaund, having previously announced his intention to contest as an independent candidate.The counting of the votes will be done on October 8, along with the Jammu and Kashmir, where elections were held after 10 years.","Haryana on Saturday will vote to elect MLAs for the 90-member House.

NEW DELHI: Protesting junior doctors in Kolkata called off their "" total cease work "" on Friday and resumed their service while also issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to the Mamata Banerjee government to meet their demands or else they would launch an indefinite hunger strike .The doctors had called for ""total cease work"" demanding better safety and security at medical facilities.The now-called-off strike, which began on October 1, followed an earlier partial return to work on September 21 after a 42-day protest.The initial protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.""Considering the well-being of the patients, we've decided to call off the 'total cease work', but we are not doing this due to the fear of (West Bengal) government. If our demands are not met within 24 hours, we will be forced to go on a hunger strike,"" said an agitating junior doctor to news agency PTI.The doctor also alleged that one of their colleagues was assaulted by the police during their protest march earlier today.On Wednesday, a protest march was organised by the Junior Doctors' Front in Kolkata, demanding justice for a medic who was raped and murdered.The march, which began at College Street and ended in Esplanade area, was joined by thousands of junior doctors and people from various walks of life. The protesters vowed to continue their agitation until the government takes decisive action.The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers , and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals.The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment.""We joined our profession to serve the people, but how can we do so when we constantly live in fear? We don't feel safe in the very places where we are supposed to save lives,"" said another junior doctor.Despite initial promises by the West Bengal government to address the doctors' concerns, the agitating doctors claim that there has been little follow-up action.The government's attempts to broker peace with the doctors have so far been unsuccessful, with state officials urging the medics to return to work and suggesting that police investigations into the alleged murder of the junior doctor are ongoing.","The doctors had called for ""total cease work"" demanding better safety and security at medical facilities.

What is SCO?

On Saarc's revival

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) meeting scheduled to take place on October 15 and 16.""The external affairs minister will lead our delegation to Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit which will be held in Islamabad on 15 and 16 October,"" said Randhir Jaiswal, external affairs ministry spokesperson.Pakistan had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) in-person meeting, which now Jaishankar will be attending.Pakistan will be hosting the SCO meeting as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG, the second highest decision-making body in the Eurasian group after the Council of Heads of State. PM Modi has been a regular at the heads of state summit, although he skipped the same in Kazakhstan this year apparently because it clashed with the Parliament session in early July.SCO is one of the few multilateral forums where India and Pakistan have managed to work together, despite the hostilities that have plagued the relationship since their abortive attempt to relaunch the dialogue process in 2015 and the terror attacks that followed.While Indian delegations have travelled to Pakistan for participation in SCO exercises and vice versa, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India last year for a meeting of SCO foreign ministers. This cooperation has been made possible by the SCO Charter that doesn't allow member-states to raise bilateral issues.The SCO is a Eurasian permanent intergovernmental international organisation created in June 2001 by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and China. The SCO was preceded by the Shanghai Five mechanism.Known as the ""alliance of the East"", the SCO is the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of geographical coverage and population, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population.SCO represents around 42 per cent of the world's population and 20 per cent of the global GDP. The SCO is seen as a counter-balance to Nato, limiting the influence of United States of America (USA) in Central Asia.India was an observer state at the SCO since 2005 and was admitted as a full member of the SCO in 2017. India's membership was pushed by Russia which was aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region. However, with changes in the geopolitical realities since 2014, India aims to stay involved in the SCO to balance the growing closeness between Russia and China even as India has got closer to the US.Responding on the chances of Saarc's revival, which has remained in abeyance since 2017, Jaiswal said the government ""has given impetus to Bimstec on Saarc"".""We attach deep importance to regional cooperation, to regional connectivity. Therefore, we have given impetus to BIMSTEC on Saarc.

You can not wipe out Santana dharma. If anyone tries to wipe out Santana dharma let me tell you from the feet of lord Balaji you will be wiped out.""He also said a ' Sanatana Dharma Protection Board ' should be established at both the national and state level to oversee the implementation of this Act. ""Annual funds must be allocated to support this board and its activities,"" he added.Pawan Kalyan further advocated for the implementation of sanatana dharma certification.

However, with Modi’s participation in SCO restricted to the heads of state summit, the key question always was whether he would nominate Jaishankar, who has participated in the same meetings in the past.India also had the option to send a junior minister or participate virtually.Foreign minister Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan later this month, although it's for SCO summit and can't be seen as a peace outreach, opens the possibility of a rare high-level visit from India to Islamabad at a time when ties remain downgraded since the revocation of special status of J&K in Aug 2019.The decision to send Jaishankar is significant as India had the option of sending a junior minister or participating virtually. Jaishankar had said recently that India is not passive on Pakistan and will react accordingly to both positive and negative developments. Whether or not there's a bilateral meeting with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar is likely to depend more on the host.India's last high commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, said the ball is now firmly in Pakistan's court as by sending Jaishankar India has made a bold move, signalling its desire to stabilise this troubled relationship. ""Pakistan must seize this opportunity and as the host propose a meaningful bilateral conversation on SCO sidelines. A good starting point for both countries would be to grab some low-hanging fruit - exchanging high commissioners and reviving trade ties,"" he said.While announcing Jaishankar's participation, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the visit was about SCO and not much should be read into it. The visit also underscores the significance India attaches to the Eurasian bloc.Despite the Chinese predominance, and efforts to position it as an anti-West forum, SCO remains an important platform for India to build ties with resource-rich central Asia and address issues related to regional security and assert its strategic autonomyInterestingly, as foreign secretary, Jaishankar had accompanied then Union foreign minister Sushma Swaraj when she visited Pakistan in 2015 for Heart of Asia - Istanbul Process talks.",S Jaishankar will represent India at the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

""We have to catch up with them,"" Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said, speaking in the run-up to the IAF Day on Oct 8.""We have done our analysis. We don't have a design to go on an offensive unnecessarily. Only when we are pushed will we do something,"" he said, adding that IAF has its operational plans in place to tackle any contingency.Acknowledging that IAF was grappling with a depleting number of fighter squadrons, which is down to just 30 when 42 are authorized, ACM Singh added, ""We are focusing on fighting with whatever we have... so training becomes very important. Should we be required to contest with somebody, we should be able to win.""China has deployed additional jets, including its most advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at its airfields facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping after upgrading them with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.This somewhat offsets the terrain constraints China faces at its airbases due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft. Overall, China has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.ACM Singh said China is rapidly building infrastructure, but India too is constructing new airfields, which include the high-altitude Nyoma one in eastern Ladakh, and strengthening capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft.Plans are also afoot to take over or use civil advance landing grounds (ALGs) in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), after upgrading ALGs in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.""It's important for our manufacturing agencies to increase their production rate,"" ACM Singh said. IAF would be able to plug its shortfalls if HAL sticks to its promise of stepping up its annual production rate to 24 Tejas fighters. ""Private players also have to come in in a major way... We can't rely on only one production agency,"" he said.IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. It is yet to get the first ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A jet of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021. Another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore are also going to be ordered soon.Then, IAF plans to induct at least six squadrons (108 jets) of Tejas Mark-2, with a longer combat range and greater weapon-carrying capacity. In August 2022, the PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the over Rs 9,000 crore development cost for Tejas Mark-2 with more powerful GE-F414 engines, and the first test-flight is slated for October next year.

Dalrymple criticises British Musuem exhibition 'Silk Roads' for ‘excluding’ India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalrymple-criticises-british-musuem-exhibition-silk-roads-for-excluding-india/articleshow/113949562.cms,"Ceramic figure of a lute player (Credit: Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford)

LONDON: Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum featuring over 300 objects from the Silk Roads from CE 500 to CE 1000 for excluding India.Speaking to TOI from London after visiting the show, Dalrymple said he was shocked India was excluded given that India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.The exhibition “Silk Roads”, which opened last week, claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route, instead showing how the Silk Roads were made up of overlapping networks.”“Hanging from the ceiling in a single corridor are various location names — it covers almost all of Asia, except India, and it seems so bizarre, because India was the largest trading partner of the Roman empire,” the author said.“When you are trying to present the trade routes of the ancient world and do all the minor sites of international trade and miss out the biggest trading partner where east-west trade took place in its greatest quantity, it is bizarre, particularly when you open the exhibition with a Buddha from Swat and end with a purse containing Rajasthani garnets,” he said.“They acknowledge these garnets, but there is no display for India which should be at the heart of the show. It ends up being a bizarre omission, almost inexplicable, to anyone that knows the centrality of India to ancient trade networks,” he added, pointing out not one Roman coin horde has ever been found in China, yet Roman coin hordes are found in India every year.India was the greatest trading partner with Rome of the classical world, while China and Rome had only the very faintest impression of each other’s existence, Dalrymple said.This is a theme of his book, ""The Golden Road”, in which he argues this notion of an East-West overland route linking China with the Mediterranean, the so-called Silk Road, is a myth which grew out of a Sino-centric reframing of history. “Silk was not even the biggest product imported from the East; pepper from India was,” he said.“India has a haunting presence throughout the exhibition,” Dalrymple said.Buddhism is a central feature, even if the exhibition misses out the home of Buddhism, India.“Nalanda doesn’t feature at all,” he said. “Yet this was the period when the Buddhist monks were coming from Japan and China to Nalanda.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation made by Dalrymple. The exhibition goes beyond the narrow 19th-century definition of the Silk Road to present a richer, more complex story of the Silk Roads as overlapping networks.”“Maps in the exhibition and accompanying book also refer to sites from India. For instance, a map showing the probable route of the 9th century ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia, near the island of Belitung, recognises that the vessel most likely stopped at ports along the coast of the Indian subcontinent,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Objects featured throughout the exhibition point to the importance of India in the trade of goods and the transmission of knowledge.”“The game of chess is noted as an invention in India probably around 500 CE and is represented by the world’s oldest group of chess pieces, made from elephant ivory probably sourced from India,” the spokesperson said.",Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum for excluding India. India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.

"Polls no solution to Kashmir issue, talks only way forward: Mirwaiz Umar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/polls-no-solution-to-kashmir-issue-talks-only-way-forward-mirwaiz-umar/articleshow/113949479.cms,"SRINAGAR: Neither guns, nor elections could bring a solution to the Kashmir issue , Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said Friday, asserting that dialogue was the only way to resolve the issue for achieving everlasting peace.In his sermon after the Friday prayers at Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, Kashmir’s chief cleric, while recalling talks with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani and Manmohan Singh, said Hurriyat had always advocated meaningful dialogue for permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue, but claimed “there was no seriousness on the other side”.Hurriyat did not want to see guns in the hands of youth as the “Kashmir conflict” had already consumed three generations, he noted.Addressing the congregation, Mirwaiz maintained that Hurriyat was never against election in J&K, but against it being projected as a solution to what he termed a longstanding “dispute”. The separatist outfit, which has in the past issued poll boycott calls, desisted from doing so this time around. Elections, however, “can’t be misconstrued as the settlement of the Kashmir issue”, he said.“The reality is that assembly or Lok Sabha elections are only for resolution for day-to-day issues like ‘sadak, bijli and paani (road, electricity and water). The large issue, which is the political dispute, remains there,” he added.Warning against a potential escalation, Mirwaiz referred to the situation in West Asia and hoped the Kashmir issue would be resolved “before it takes an ugly turn and the shape of a war”.He took a swipe at J&K’s mainstream parties and their leaders, saying they claimed to be contesting the elections to protect the rights of people. “Had they really been serious, they would have fought unitedly,” Mirwaiz said.Mirwaiz also brought up the abrogation of Article 370 , saying “our political rights were snatched and we lost our control on land rights, jobs and what not”.Asserting that the “iron fist policy will not work”, he said the Govt of India must come to the table for talks. “Hurriyat leadership may be in jail or under detention. Many of them are booked under PSA and many under UAPA. But, the fact remains that Hurriyat continues to represent the genuine aspirations and sentiments of people of Kashmir,” he said.He also sought answers from the J&K administration as to why the historic Jamia Masjid was closed on important religious occasions such as Shab-e-Qadr, Rabi-ul Awal, Jumat-ul-Vida etc. “Can’t you see how people of Kashmir cooperate when there are religious festivals of other communities. Don’t you see how we cooperate to make Amarnath Yatra a grand success? Why is Jamia being locked and prayers disallowed when there are special Muslim rituals?” he asked.","Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said Hurriyat had always advocated meaningful dialogue for permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue.

Since the Union govt will recommend the Lt Governor to pick the MLAs, critics say they will toe Centre’s line.“Congress will get comfortable majority, but this is anti-democratic and a fraud with democracy and mandate of the people who cast their vote to elect 90 MLAs,” said Ravinder Sharma, senior vice-president, J&K Pradesh Congress Committee, at a press conference in Jammu Friday.It shows BJP’s desperation to manipulate numbers although the party can, in no way, form govt, he added.The Lt Governor has to act on the advice of the council of ministers, and it would be a misuse of the provision of nomination if used to convert majority into minority and vice-versa, in case such a situation arises after counting, Sharma said.“BJP had, perhaps, kept this provision of nomination with a view to play this fraud,” he added.","With the inclusion of five nominated MLAs, the J&K legislative assembly will expand to 95 members, increasing the majority threshold to 48 seats.
