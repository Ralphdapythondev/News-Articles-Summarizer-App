CDSCO approves indigenous Mpox test kit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cdsco-approves-indigenous-mpox-test-kit/articleshow/112911991.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major boost to India’s preparedness against Monkeypox (Mpox), a viral infection which was recently declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO recently, India’s top drug regulatory body has given manufacturing approval to a test kit that can give results in just 40 minutes. Traditional methods can take one to two hours to give results for Mpox tests and they are available in limited labs.Hariharan Subramanian, managing director, Siemens Healthcare Private Limited which has come up with the test-kit, said, “The urgency for precise and accurate diagnostics couldn't be more crucial than now.By providing India with advanced assay kits tailored to combat Monkeypox, we are taking a proactive stance in battling this disease and prioritizing prompt and precise detection that can truly make a difference in saving lives.""The IMDX Mpox Detection RT-PCR Assay, the test kit, has been clinically validated by ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune. It targets two distinct regions in the viral genome, spanning both clade I and clade II variants of the monkeypox virus. This ensures thorough detection across various viral strains, providing comprehensive results, the company said in its statement. It added that the assay is platform-agnostic and seamlessly fits into existing lab workflows with standard PCR setups, eliminating the need for new instruments.Mpox is a viral illness that is self-limiting in most cases. Patients recover completely in 2-4 weeks with supportive care. However, in rare cases involving people with some underlying illness or due to secondary infections due to improper care, complications can occur, experts say.Unlike influenza or Covid-19, the monkeypox is not air-borne. It spreads mostly through unprotected close physical contact with an infected person. Sexual transmission is also an important mode of spread. In addition to that, the infection can spread from contact with the infected material from the blisters and scabs of the patient that can contaminate material such as bedding. Therefore, maintaining hygiene is important. Another mode of transmission is through the caregivers who are not using personal protective measuresDuring 2022-24, India reported only 30 cases of Mpox with most cases being either travel related or among African nationals living in India. However, there have not been any new cases of the viral infection reported recently, according to govt sources.","The IMDX Mpox Detection RT-PCR Assay, the test kit, has been clinically validated by ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune.

For instance, ESAF Small Finance Bank Ltd launched the 'Rainbow Savings Account' in 2022, offering exclusive features such as high savings rates and advanced debit card facilities to transgender customers.Following the Supreme Court judgment in October 2023, the Centre established a six-member committee chaired by the cabinet secretary in April 2024 to address various issues concerning the queer community. The committee's mandate included examining measures to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in accessing goods and services and ensuring their protection from violence, harassment, or coercion.","The advisory was posted by department of financial services, which comes under the finance ministry.

Purulia arms drop case: Why Denmark denied India's extradition request for Niels Holck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/purulia-arms-drop-case-why-denmark-denied-indias-extradition-request-for-niels-holck/articleshow/112910799.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Danish court on Thursday turned down India's request to extradite Niels Holck, accused of air-dropping four tonnes of weapons in West Bengal's Purulia in 1995.The court said that there is a possible risk Holck would be subjected to treatment that violates the European Convention on Human Rights if he were sent to India, despite India's diplomatic assurances that he would be housed in a special detention centre during the criminal proceedings, potentially accompanied by Danish police officers as observers.India has been seeking Holck's extradition for several years to face trial on suspicion of arms smuggling. Holck had previously admitted to a Danish court that he was part of a seven-member group responsible for smuggling weapons into West Bengal on a Russian cargo plane on December 17, 1995.The illegal arms drop, known as the Purulia Arms Drop, occurred in the Purulia district of West Bengal on December 17, 1995. The weapons were dropped from an Antonov An-26 aircraft before an Indian Air Force aircraft intercepted it.Five Latvian citizens and Peter Bleach, a British citizen and former Special Air Service officer, were arrested after the Indian Air Force intercepted their returning plane, while 'Kim Davy' alias Niels Holck, escaped. All of them were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2000 but eventually released.Meanwhile, Holck was arrested later in Denmark in April 2010 following a deal with India over the terms of his extradition, including a promise that he would not be given the death penalty and would serve any sentence in Denmark.However, a Danish district court in 2011 overturned the authorities' decision, saying he risked mistreatment in India. An appeals court later upheld the district court's ruling.India's initial extradition request for Holck was made in 2002. Although the Danish government agreed, two Danish courts rejected the extradition, citing concerns that Holck would face torture or other inhumane treatment in India. In June 2023, Denmark revisited a 2016 Indian extradition request, stating that the requirements in the extradition act had been met.",Niels Holck accused of air-dropping four tonnes of weapons in West Bengal's Purulia in 1995.

"To attract private investment, a robust arbitration system is a must: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-attract-private-investment-a-robust-arbitration-system-is-a-must-sc/articleshow/112910722.cms,"Can Railway,

and

PSUs

appoint arbitrators unilaterally?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said at a time when private investment in India is crucial to the country’s economy, the need of the hour is a robust, transparent and independent arbitration system to infuse confidence in the domestic and international investors.This observation came from a five-judge bench comprising CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, P S Narasimha, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra during the adjudication of a question that is of vital importance to investors’ confidence – can the railways, PSUs and NBFCs create a panel of arbitrators from which the opposite party is to choose from for adjudication of disputes arising from alleged contractual breaches.Many private parties had questioned the impartiality and independence of the panel of arbitrators, which is put in place by the railways, PSUs and NBFCs, claiming that their autonomy of choosing an arbitrator was breached, rendering the arbitration process arbitrary or one-sided.The CJI-led bench said it is of vital public importance that arbitration processes remain fair and private stakeholders’ interest and confidence in the arbitral proceedings is maintained without compromising on the government interests. “But the government's interest is not that it should always get a favourable arbitral award,” the bench said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the railways and PSUs have hundreds of running arbitration proceedings involving thousands of crores of rupees at a time and for that purpose a panel of arbitrators withdomain knowledge in needed to be in place without compromising on the integrity and capability of the persons included in the panel of arbitrators.He said even the international arbitration laws validate one party appointing arbitrators if that is provided in the contract and a private party enters into an agreement on its own volition to take up the contracted work.He said the Indian Arbitration Act also recognizes the creation of a panel by one party from which both sides to arbitral dispute can choose from. The SG said the Act amply provisioned for party autonomy in the arbitration process while ensuring its fairness.He was supported by additional solicitor general K M Natraj, and senior advocates Guru Krishna Kumar and Madhavi Divan. The two senior advocates said that NBFCs face a huge number of defaulters in repayment of loans and do not respond to notices for arbitration. If arbitrators are not to be appointed by NBFCs unilaterally, then because of earlier judgments of the SC, the arbitral awards would be rendered null and void which would create a paradise for defaulters.Arguments on the crucial issue of whether railways and PSUs can validly and unilaterally create a panel of arbitrators would be concluded on Friday.","Supreme Court says need of the hour is a robust, transparent and independent arbitration system to infuse confidence in the domestic and international investors.

BAHRAICH: Wolves are athletic and sly, and therefore catching them is no mean task. This is the reason that three killer wolves, which have unleashed terror in Sisiya village of UP's Bahraich, have remained elusive despite 25 teams of the forest department hunting for them in a non-stop search operation .The trio has already slayed seven villagers, including six children, and injured 22 persons in the past 45 days.A two-member TOI team joined the chase with the forest teams which are equipped with night-vision drones, nets, and tranquiliser guns in one of the biggest hunting operations in the state in recent years. CM Yogi Adityanath dispatched forest minister Arun Kumar Saxena to ground zero on Wednesday for an on-the spot report of the operation.After an unsuccessful non-stop 48-hour combing, the teams finally had a glimmer of hope around 9.30am on Wednesday when drones located the lethal trio in the sugarcane fields of Sisiya village near the house of one Holi Yadav.One wolf was seen limping as its left foot was injured, said a forest official.""We are approaching with caution this time. Wolves are very sly and they managed to escape when we came close to catching them in the previous two attempts. This time we have laid a trap with a goat as bait. A tranquiliser team is ready once we get the breakthrough,"" said divisional forest officer Akashdeep Badhawan who is heading the task force team.We have spread elephant dung and urine in the lanes of villages to deter the wolves. When set aflame, the dung produces an odour that mimics the presence of elephants which are known to repel predators like wolves. The idea is to create the illu sion of elephants nearby,” added Badhawan.The forest teams, clad in protective gear which have now got dyed in mud given the continuous search, are working tirelessly to lay traps and establish a human cordon around the area.As night falls and the hunt continues, the tension is palpable. The forest teams remain vigilant, their eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of the predators.Meanwhile, villagers are also hoping for a divine intervention to ward off the evil and most of them are busy chanting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. Holi Yadav, 54, whose house is near the sugarcane field where the wolves are hiding, believes prayers and chants will drive away the wolves. “I was born in this village but never saw such an attack. Children have been told not to venture out and villagers are keeping their homes locked even in the afternoon,” said Yadav.Holi’s neighbour Babu Ram said chanting Hanuman Chalisa will ward off the omen.","Three killer wolves have unleashed terror in Sisiya village of UP's Bahraich. 25 teams of the forest department are hunting for them in a non-stop search operation.

'Rahul Gandhi's politics has changed': Smriti Irani dissects his new 'white T-shirt strategy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-politics-has-changed-smriti-irani-dissects-his-new-white-t-shirt-strategy/articleshow/112894719.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP leader Smriti Irani pointed out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's political strategy. Dissecting the evolution of Rahul's approach, Irani suggested that his newfound focus on caste politics and symbolic gestures marks a significant departure from his earlier tactics.In a recent podcast, Smriti Irani said, ""There has been a change in Rahul Gandhi's politics."" Highlighting that the Congress leader appears to believe he has finally tasted success after years of struggling to find his footing, she said, “When he (Rahul Gandhi) speaks about caste, he for the first time in his political career, speaks as an instrument.When he wears white T-shirt in Parliament, he knows what message he is trying to send to the youth.”She also noted that every gesture and statement from Gandhi is part of a broader, more calculated strategy. ""They're planning a different game in politics now, and these guys are far from naive,"" she added.Irani highlighted that Rahul's recent emphasis on caste politics is a deliberate move, a first in his career where he is using such a sensitive issue to resonate with the masses.Rahul's shift towards caste-based rhetoric is a response to his earlier failures in garnering mass appeal through other means. ""Rahul Gandhi couldn't gain traction by visiting temples, it was being ridiculed. Many people thought that it was deception,"" she said.Irani argues that this led him to pivot towards caste as a new strategy to gain political momentum. “He then thought if this isn't helping him gain traction. What else could work, caste could. So this is a part of his political strategy. If he had a political mindset, we would have seen it reflected in his political journey already”, Irani said.In the Lok Sabha election 2019, Irani emerged victorious against Rahul Gandhi, securing a lead of 55,120 votes. However, in the 2024 election, Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma managed to unseat Irani by a substantial margin of 1.67 lakh votes.","BJP leader Smriti Irani points out a noticeable shift in Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's political strategy.

The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata in the early hours of August 9. The circumstances surrounding her death have since ignited a nationwide uproar.The series of phone calls that gradually informed her parents of the incident paint a haunting picture of how the rape-murder of the young medic was initially portrayed as a suicide.In the first call, the anxious voice on the other end was insistent yet vague.Who is speaking?I am calling from RG Kar hospital.What has happened?She is unwell. Can you come immediately?But why, what has happened?She is unwell. She has been admitted? Can you come immediately?But what has happened, at least tell us?That doctor will say. I was given your number and asked to inform the family.But please tell us what has happened.Patient is unwell, please come as soon as possible. Rest doctor will inform you.Does she have a fever?You all just come soon, as soon as possible.Is her condition not good?The condition is bad, please come as soon as possible.The lack of clarity and urgency in the initial call from the caller identifying herself as the assistant superintendent of the hospital mirrored the grim reality that awaited her family.The second call, coming from a visibly stressed caller, brought a shift in the gravity of the situation.But please tell me what has happened?Her condition is very bad. Please come as soon as possible.But what has happened?That the doctor will tell, please come soon.Who are you?I am assistant superitendant, I am not a doctor.Is there no doctor there?We have brought your daughter to the Emergency. You come and contact us.But what happened to her? She was on duty.You just come quickly, as soon as possible.The second call only compounded the family's growing horror, with no real answers to the burning questions that plagued them.The final call was the most harrowing of all. The reality of their worst fears was confirmed in a heartbreaking message.I was telling you earlier. The matter is that your daughter has died by suicide. She is dead. Police are here, we are all here, please come as soon as possible.YesThe revelation of the young doctor's death by alleged ‘suicide’ came as a brutal shock to her family, who had been desperately seeking information about her. The ambiguity and coldness of the communication only deepened their anguish. It was later found out that the case being dismissed as ‘suicide’ was actually a case of rape and murder as the investigation revealed.The case, initially handled by the Kolkata Police, has been transferred to the CBI. Civic volunteer Sanjoy Roy has been arrested, and both the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, Sandip Ghosh, and Roy have undergone polygraph tests as part of the ongoing investigation.The tragic death has spurred unprecedented protests across the nation. As the longest-running doctors' protest since the 1980s rocked the nation, the outcry against the alleged rape-murder has brought to light severe issues within the healthcare system.",The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata.

'Malicious disinformation campaign': Cornered Mamata hits back as BJP mounts pressure over Kolkata rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malicious-disinformation-campaign-cornered-mamata-hits-back-as-bjp-mounts-pressure-over-kolkata-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112903620.cms,"West Bengal Congress holds protest

'Country's outrage not just about Kolkata incident'

NEW DELHI: Mamata Banerjee , who has weathered several storms in her long political career, finds herself cornered and isolated over the brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata's R G Kar Hospital.While the BJP has been mounting relentless pressure on the West Bengal chief minister , her allies from the opposition INDIA bloc have been divided in their response. The Bengal unit of the Congress and the Left have taken to the streets against the Trinamool government even as other INDIA bloc partners have been cautious in their support for the embattled Trinamool chief.Mamata, who had yesterday unleashed a scathing attack at the BJP over the ongoing protests and had even targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seemed to have gone on the defensive today as the saffron party accused her of threatening the striking doctors.Addressing a rally organised by the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad, the West Bengal chief minister had on Wednesday urged the agitating junior doctors of Bengal to urgently consider returning to duty and said she doesn't want to lodge FIRs against the striking doctors in consideration of their future careers.Agitating doctors interpreted the chief minister's remark as a ""veiled threat"" and rejected her appeal to join work.Targeted by BJP over her remarks, Mamata asserted that she did not threaten junior doctors at state-run hospitals, who have been continuing cease-work for 21 days now. She said accusations that have come from certain quarters of her threatening the agitating junior doctors are ""completely false"" and part of a “malicious disinformation campaign”.""Let me most emphatically clarify that I have not uttered a single word against the (medical etc.) students or their movements. I totally support their movement. Their movement is genuine. I never threatened them, as some people are accusing me of doing. This allegation is completely false,"" she wrote on X.However, she justified her remarks against the BJP, which has been spearheading the agitation against the case. A BJP delegation met governor CV Ananda Bose today and requested him to protect the rights of people in Bengal and take whatever measures are necessary to lift the state out of this dire situation.Mamata wrote, ""I have spoken against BJP. I have spoken against them because, with the support of the Government of India, they are threatening the democracy in our state and trying to create anarchy. With support from the Centre, they are trying to create lawlessness and I have raised my voice against them.""The chief minister also issued a clarification with respect to her “snap back” message to her supporters against “the conspirators who need to be unmasked”.“I also clarify that the phrase (""phonsh kara"") that I had used in my speech yesterday is a quote from Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. The legendary saint had said that occasionally there is need to raise one's voice. When there are crimes and criminal offences, voice of protest has to be raised. My speech on that point was a direct allusion to the great Ramakrishnite saying,” she posted on her social media timeline.At the rally, Mamata had said: ""The time has come to resist and protest when you are insulted and maligned with false propaganda. Although I never promote violence, when faced with such ugly attacks, do not take it lying down and snap back. How you respond is up to you.""Following the remarks, the BJP had accused her of threatening opposition parties by abandoning her previous slogan of 'badla noy, badal chai' (no revenge, only change) in response to alleged insults from the opposition.And its not just the BJP that has been mounting pressure on her. The Congress and the Left, her political rivals in the state, have also hit the streets against her government.The Congress today took out a rally led by state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary from College Square to Shyambazar five-point crossing in north Kolkata, close to RG Kar Hospital.Chowdhury told reporters that Mamata Banerjee is scared of the swelling public anger and mounting protests over her alleged attempt to divert the probe and shield the real culprits.“She has even tried to threaten the agitating junior doctors of RG Kar (Hospital) who are aggrieved over the incident and blatant attempts to cover up the heinous crime by the administration subsequently. But the people of Bengal, who include the agitating junior doctors, are not to be intimidated by her or her party leaders,” he said.And while the Congress at the state level is protesting, its national leadership has been guarded in its response. Rahul Gandhi did make one mention of Kolkata incident initially, which evoked a very strong Trinamool response.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had last week come out in support of Mamata and had accused the BJP of doing politics over the rape and murder case.""She is a woman herself, she understands the pain of a woman,"" Akhilesh had said in Mamata's defence. Attacking the BJP, he had said, ""The BJP is doing politics in this matter, which it should not. Doctors are protesting over this incident but the BJP is doing politics.'Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) MP Supriya Sule had earlier reacted cautiously to the incident and had said she believed that Mamata Banerjee will initiate quick action and the victim's family will be delivered justice.""A lot of such incidents happen across the country and we condemn all of them. We believe that Mamata Banerjee will take action quickly and the family must get justice through fast-track court. We couldn't save our daughter from this incident but such incidents must not happen again..."" Supriya Sule had said.When President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday reacted to the Kolkata rape-murder horror and said ""enough is enough"", both AAP and Congress were quicl to point out that the President would do well in articulating the outrage for the whole country and not just one region or state.Declaring that ""enough is enough"", President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said it is time for India to wake up to the “perversion” of crimes against women and counter the mindset that sees women as “less powerful, less capable, less intelligent”.Reacting to the President Murmu 's remarks, Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said, ""I welcome this statement and this intervention by the President. The entire country is outraged. So it is natural that the President represents the outrage the country is feeling.""""But the country's outrage is not just about Kolkata incident, but they are also about Farrukhabad, Kolhapur, Badlapur, Pune, Ratnagiri, Jodhpur, Katni, there are so many instances. In UP, everyday you hear about one instance or the other,"" he told PTI.""The president would do well in representing and articulating the outrage of the country felt for across the country and not just one region or state,"" Khera said.AAP MP Sanjay Singh said ""With all due respect, the President's statement shows a selective approach. The Kolkata incident is shameful and saddening but it is wrong to indicate that other parts of the country are safe.""Clearly, Mamata would welcome all these statements but she would have hoped for more open support in her fight against a very aggressive BJP, which is going all out to corner the West Bengal chief minister.",West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused of threatening striking doctors. Trinamool Congress and the Left have taken to the streets against her government. Opposition INDIA bloc partners have been cautious in their support for the embattled chief minister. The Congress took out a rally led by state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112904007,imgsize-46040,width-400,resizemode-4/112904007.jpg"

The Mandi MP accused Sirumani Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann of ""trivializing rape"" after he suggested that the actor-turned politician was in a better position to explain rape as ""she has a lot of experience"".Earlier in the day, SAD leader Simranjit Singh Mann responding to the BJP MP's recent remarks on the farmers' protests over the now-scrapped farm reform laws said, ""I don't want to say this but Kangana Ranaut has a lot of experience of rape and you can ask her how rape happens so that people can be explained.Just as you gain experience from riding a bicycle, similarly, they have experience with rape.""The BJP MP outraged by the comment promptly took to X and said, ""This is so deep rooted in the psyche of this patriarchal nation that it is casually used to tease or mock a women even if she is a high profile filmmaker or politician.""""It seems this country will never stop trivialising rape, today this senior politician compared getting raped to riding a bicycle no wonder rapes and violence against women for fun,"" she added.The actor-turned politician courted controversy earlier this week by suggesting that the farmers’ protest could have led to a Bangladesh-like situation in India if not for strong measures taken by Modi government. The BJP MP also alleged that ""bodies were hanging"" and ""rapes"" were taking place during the farmers' protests, which went on for nearly a year in 2019-2020. She also went one step further and alleged the involvement of China and the US in the ""conspiracy"".The BJP MP however faced severe criticism from many opposition quarters , while the BJP distanced itself from her remarks. “The statement made by BJP MP Kangana Ranaut in the context of farmers’ movement is not the opinion of the party. BJP expresses its disagreement with the statement made by Kangana Ranaut,” the party said.It added that Ranaut was “neither permitted nor authorised” to make statements on the party’s policies. In a statement, the party further said, “BJP is committed to follow the principles of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas’ and social harmony.” However, after facing backlash and getting reprimanded by the party, the BJP MP so far has met BJP chief Nadda twice with the latest meeting coming on Thursday.The actor's remarks claiming that “Bangladesh like anarchy” could have taken place in India “in the name of farmers’ protest”, came during a protest for upcoming movie 'Emergency'.“Outside forces are planning to destroy us with help of insiders.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday alleged that there is a growing tendency among the opposition to prevent 'indigenous Hindu MLAs ' from speaking in the assembly.His remarks came during the discussion of The Assam Land and Revenue Regulation (Second Amendment) Bill, 2024. Sarma condemned the opposition for interrupting a speech by his party MLA Bhuban Pegu.""There is a new tendency in the House not to allow indigenous Hindu MLAs to speak.It's a dangerous trend. Please do not be so aggressive. After our land, now don't try to capture the assembly,"" Sarma said.Pegu's speech referenced historical assembly records about alleged migration and aggression from the then East Bengal into Assam.""You cannot stop talking about Hindu-Muslim issues. These are hard realities of life. Even the census asks us to write down our religion,"" said the chief minister.Commenting on the Bill, which was passed by the Assembly, Sarma described it as a fight for the survival of the Assamese community, which he claimed is 'about to be extinct'. ""Our land in Dhubri, Goalpara, Barpeta, Darrang, Nagaon, Morigaon have gone. Now, we are struggling to survive,"" he added.The discussion escalated further, leading Congress MLAs to stage a walkout in protest of Sarma's statement.A delegation from the United Opposition Forum, Assam (UOFA) submitted a memorandum to President Droupadi Murmu, calling for the dismissal of CM Sarma. They accused him of failing to maintain law and order and inciting division among communities with his statements. The memorandum was handed over to the President through Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya at the Raj Bhavan. The delegation was led by Congress Lok Sabha MP Pardyut Bordoloi and UOFA general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.The opposition parties claimed that over the past two years, CM Sarma has made several provocative statements, including on the floor of the assembly, targeting the Muslim community. According to them, about a year ago, Sarma incited certain youths to expel religious minorities from Guwahati, who were working as vegetable vendors, rickshaw pullers, private drivers, and construction laborers.The memorandum also mentioned an incident where the Gauhati HC reprimanded the state government for demolishing houses of Muslim families in Batadrava, Nagaon district, using bulldozers. The court ordered compensation for the affected families.""The chief minister tried to whip up communal frenzy by targeting the Muslim community, which led to the attack on some people belonging to religious minorities in Sivasagar by BJP leaders and workers,"" the opposition parties alleged.On the issue of law and order, the opposition leaders highlighted that encounter deaths by police are reportedly the highest in Assam according to a Centre's report presented in Parliament. They also claimed that incidents of killings, dacoities, rapes, and murders have become regular occurrences during Sarma's tenure.Additionally, the UOFA pointed out a significant security lapse, stating that on Independence Day this year, the United Liberation Front of Assam (Independent), or ULFA(I), planted bombs at multiple locations. The police were unaware of the threat until the outfit revealed it via an email.The memorandum also provided statistics on sexual crimes, stating that during the BJP's rule from 2016-2023, 17,657 rape cases were recorded as per government data. Furthermore, in the last seven months alone, 580 new rape cases were reported, with 15 occurrences in August this year.""It is clear from the above facts that the Chief Minister has compromised his oath of office in the name of the Constitution, grossly violated the Constitution by creating hatred and enmity among different communities by his series of provocative statements, failed to provide security to the life and property of citizens and indulged in rampant corruption.""Besides Bordoloi and Gogoi, the memorandum was signed by state Congress president Bhupen Borah, leader of the opposition in the state assembly Debabrata Saikia, Lok Sabha MP Rakibul Hussain, CPI(M)'s Isfaqur Rahman, Raijor Dal's Russel Dal, and others.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma alleged that there is a growing tendency among the opposition to prevent 'indigenous Hindu MLAs'from speaking in the assembly.

DGCA puts cash-strapped SpiceJet under its 'enhanced surveillance'; airline sends 150 cabin crew members on furlough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-says-cash-strapped-spicejet-flights-to-operate-under-its-enhanced-surveillance/articleshow/112901031.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cash-strapped SpiceJet will now operate under the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s ( DGCA ) enhanced surveillance . Following “cancellation of flights and financial stress being experienced by SpiceJet,” the regulator had conducted a special audit of the airline’s engineering facilities on August 7 & 8, 2024, which “revealed certain deficiencies.”“In light of the (airline’s) past record” and audit findings, SpiceJet will again see an increase in spot checks and night surveillance of its aircraft “to ensure safety of operations,” the regulator said in a statement Thursday.The airline also placed 150 cabin crew members on “furlough for three months.”The regulatory action came on a day when poor financial condition saw a SpiceJet Delhi-Dubai flight (SG 11) not overflying Pakistan and taking the longer Gujarat-Arabian Sea route as the airline reportedly could not manage to pay overflying charges to Pakistan. This flight took 3 hours and 44 minutes, 20 minutes more than the same flight on Wednesday when it overflew Pakistan.Then Dubai Airport on Thursday morning stopped boarding of SpiceJet flights — something that has happened multiple times this fortnight — over dues. As a result, the aircraft flew without passengers to India. Industry sources say Dubai Airports could cancel some slots given to SpiceJet which could then go to other Indian carriers.Regarding Dubai trouble, a SpiceJet spokesperson said: “Due to operational reasons, a few SpiceJet flights from Dubai were cancelled. Affected passengers have been accommodated on our subsequent flights; other airlines or provided with a full refund. All our scheduled flights from Dubai are now operating as planned.”Late Thursday night, the airline said it has “made the difficult decision to temporarily place 150 cabin crew members on furlough for three months (due) to current lean travel season and reduced fleet size.” “During this furlough period, they will continue to retain their status as employees of SpiceJet, with all health benefits and earned leave intact. As we work toward enhancing our fleet following the upcoming qualified institutional placement, we look forward to welcoming our crew members back to active duty. We are committed to supporting our employees during this period,” the spokesperson added.The airline — along with its employees, passengers and other stakeholders — have been facing turbulence for some years now due to the former’s inability to so far raise the required amount of funds. It has been reducing operations and its domestic market share this July, 2024, had fallen to 3.1% from 5.6% in January 2024, as per Govt data.“After a series of occurrences reported on SpiceJet fleet in 2022, a special drive of spot checks was undertaken during which the airline was permitted to release aircraft for operations only after confirming to DGCA that all reported defects/ malfunctions had been rectified. In 2023, it was again placed under enhanced surveillance (due to) financial stress,” the DGCA statement added.SpiceJet has not paid July salaries to many employees till date. On Wednesday several airline staffers, including loaders who are supposed to get about Rs 15,000, did not report for work at Guwahati. The airline has not deposited provident fund for a long time. TDS is routinely delayed. Salaries are elusive. Many airport operators and oil companies have put the airline on cash and carry. Some engine and aircraft lessors have the airlines to court to repossess their assets over alleged non-payment of rentals.DGCA data shows only 29.3% of SpiceJet domestic flights operated last month. Many engine and aircraft lessors have taken SpiceJet to court over non-payment of rentals.",SpiceJet will again see an increase in spot checks and night surveillance of its aircraft.

INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea.

, which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea. INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors, allowing them to remain submerged for extended periods, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that need to surface regularly.

Indian nuclear-powered ballistic submarines are named the Arihant class, a Sanskrit term meaning 'Destroyer of the Enemy.' The name was chosen for its subtlety and appropriateness.

The Indian government plans to build both nuclear and conventional submarines as part of its long-term acquisition and capability development strategy. This includes five Arihant-class submarines and six nuclear attack submarines, to be constructed in three phases.

With India’s “no-first use” nuclear policy, SSBNs (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Nuclear Submarines) play a key role in deterrence due to their difficulty in detection and their ability to survive a surprise attack and execute retaliatory strikes.

Countries like the US, Russia, and China have larger SSBNs with longer-range missiles. For example, China has six Jin-class SSBNs with JL-3 missiles capable of 10,000 kilometers, and the US operates 14 Ohio-class SSBNs.

A project costing around Rs 40,000 crore is under consideration by the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the construction of two 6,000-tonne ‘hunter-killer’ SSNs (nuclear-powered attack submarines), armed with torpedoes, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles. The construction is expected to take at least a decade.

On conventional submarine development, Indian Navy has acquired six new Kalvari-class submarines and plans to add 15 more through Project 75 India, Project-76, and Project-75 AS.

NEW DELHI: In a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities, India on Thursday commissioned INS Arighat , which is the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles .The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750 km, took place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.""Second Arihant-Class submarine 'INS Arighaat' commissioned into Indian Navy in the presence of Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh in Visakhapatnam. PM Modi-led Govt is working on mission mode to equip soldiers with top-quality weapons & platforms,"" the defence ministry wrote on X.","INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018. Both submarines are powered by 83 MW pressurized light- water reactors. Indian government plans to build both nuclear and conventional submarines as part of its long-term acquisition and capability development strategy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112900676,imgsize-30362,width-400,resizemode-4/112900676.jpg"
Azad’s absence likely to impact his fledgling party in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/azads-absence-likely-to-impact-his-fledgling-party-in-jk/articleshow/112905459.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Democratic Progressive Azad Party ( DPAP ), founded by former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad just two years ago, has virtually downed its shutters after Azad stepped back from campaigning for party candidates, citing bad health.Azad formed DPAP in Sept 2022 after resigning from Congress, when the Group of 20 within the party resented Congress’ style of functioning and demanded inner party democracy.Azad returned to his home ground Jammu & Kashmir with the impression that he would make waves in the Union Territory. However, he began to be considered BJP’s ally, which dented much of his credibility.Azad had won the Lok Sabha elections in 1980 and 1984 and was CM of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir from 2005 to 2008.Otherwise, he has been nominated to Rajya Sabha, along with a berth in the ministry, by Congress. But Azad criticised the Gandhi family in his recently published autobiography “Azad”, which soured his relationship with the Gandhis.People close to Azad say, his drawback is his inaccessibility. While Azad lost to BJP leader and Union minister Jitendra Singh from Udhampur in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the DPAP candidate was a distant third in 2024. His other candidates too could not win any of the seats in Jammu & Kashmir.Azad began losing his loyalists one by one, who wanted to return to Congress. Azad’s biggest shock came when GM Saroori, who contested against Jitendra Singh in the Lok Sabha polls this year, filed nomination as an Independent from Inderwal constituency, after his name did not figure in DPAP’s first list for the assembly elections. Saroori had resigned from the Congress along with Azad in Aug 2022.On Aug 25, Azad had issued a statement and stepped back from campaigning citing health issues. He said he developed chest pain and left for Delhi on Aug 26 and was admitted to AIIMS.Azad’s absence will impact seats like Doda and Bhaderwah, which get a significant number of votes from Azad’s native areas of Gundoh and Bhallessa.While DPAP candidate Abdul Majeed Wani would have gained advantage in Doda from Azad’s presence, on Bhaderwah seat, party candidate Muhammad Aslam Goni would be facing a tough time ahead in an already tight contest where Congress, BJP and National Conference have fielded their candidates.In other seats of Chenab Valley in the Jammu region where DPAP has fielded candidates, the party will have to garner votes without any known face.Azad, however, has made it clear that candidates should decide whether they can continue without his presence. “Candidates should assess whether they can continue without my presence. If they feel my absence would impact their chances, they have the freedom to withdraw their candidacy,” a DPAP statement said, quoting Azad.","Former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has stepped back from campaigning for party candidates, citing bad health.

It is the last port of judicial refuge. Further delay only aggravates a person’s suffering and misery. That apart, the sluggish pace of trials in momentous matters hurts nation and society. Those in positions of power should devise ways to change the scenario. It has been said a thousand times before but needs to be restated that “justice delayed is justice denied.”

NEW DELHI: Increase in strength of judges in the Supreme Court appears to have had minimal impact on the pendency of cases, which has in the last 10 years grown eight times and reduced only twice. Pendency in the apex court is now close to 83,000 cases, the highest ever.After the sanctioned strength of judges in the SC was increased from 26 to 31 in 2009, the pendency kept increasing steadily from 50,000 to 66,000 in 2013.It reduced to 63,000 during the tenure of CJIs P Sathasivam and R M Lodha in 2014. The next CJI H L Dattu was able to further reduce it to 59,000 in 2015.Next year, it increased to 63,000 cases during the tenure of CJI T S Thakur. Justice J S Khehar, who was the first to propose paperless courts through infusion of information technology in the case management system, was able to reduce it substantially to 56,000. In 2018, during the tenure of Justice Dipak Misra as CJI, the pendency increased to 57,000 cases.Justice Ranjan Gogoi as CJI was able to convince the govt to increase the sanctioned strength of SC judges, through a Parliamentary enactment, from 31 to 34 in 2019. But the increase in judge strength also saw the pendency increase to 60,000 cases. When Justice S A Bobde was CJI, Covid pandemic virtually paralysed the justice delivery system for some time before it limped back through virtual proceedings. The pendency shot up to 65,000.In 2021-22, Covid continued to impede case disposal even during CJI N V Ramana's tenure as CJI. The pendency touched 70,000 cases in 2021 and increased to 79,000 by the end of 2022, a year in which CJIs Ramana and U U Lalit retired, and Justice D Y Chandrachud became CJI.In the last two years, the pendency increased by almost 4,000 cases to get within touching distance of 83,000 cases, the highest ever, displaying its potency to defy many innovative I-T based technological interventions under Justice Chandrachud to streamline categorisation and bunching of pending cases .Of the 82,831 cases pending as of today, 27,604 (of 33% of cases) are less than a year old. While 38,995 fresh cases were filed this year, the SC disposed of 37,158 cases, the rate of disposal almost matching the rate of institution of cases.In the high courts, the cumulative pendency of cases was 41 lakh in 2014.

"Woman sole 'streedhan' owner, dad can't demand its return: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-sole-streedhan-owner-dad-cant-demand-its-return-sc/articleshow/112908199.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that a woman is the sole owner of her ' streedhan ', the gold ornaments and other articles given by her parents at the time of marriage, and said that after divorce, her father has no authority to demand return of those gifts from her erstwhile in-laws.One P Veerabhadra Rao's daughter was married in Dec 1999 and the couple migrated to the US.After 16 years of marriage, the daughter filed for divorce. A Louis county circuit court in Missouri granted divorce by mutual consent in Feb 2016. All possessions, material and financial, were settled between the parties through a separation agreement. She remarried in May 2018.Three years later, Rao filed an FIR against his daughter's erstwhile in-laws in Hyderabad seeking return of her 'streedhan'.The erstwhile in-laws unsuccessfully moved Telangana HC for quashing of the FIR. Then they appealed against the HC order in the SC A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol quashed the case against the in-laws and said the father had no locus standi to seek return of his daughter's 'streedhan' as that belonged solely to her.""The generally accepted rule, which has been judicially recognised, is that the woman exercises an absolute right over the property,"" said Justice Karol, writing the judgment.""The jurisprudence, as has been developed by this court, is unequivocal with respect to the singular right of the female (wife or former wife as the case may be) being the sole owner of 'streedhan'. A husband has no right, and it must then be necessarily concluded that a father, too, has no right when the daughter is alive, well and entirely capable of making decisions such as pursuing the cause of the recovery of her 'streedhan',"" the bench said. ""The object of criminal proceedings is to bring a wrongdoer to justice, and it is not a means to get revenge or seek vendetta against persons with whom the complainant may have a grudge,"" it added. One more aspect which went against the father was that he initiated criminal proceedings for recovery of 'streedhan' after more than two decades of marriage, five years after its dissolution, and three years after his daughter's remarriage.Justice Karol said another crucial element against the father's claim was that he was not authorised by his daughter to initiate action for recovery of her 'streedhan'. The court also found that the father had provided no proof of any 'streedhan' being given to his daughter at the time of her marriage in 1999 and that the parties to matrimony had never raised the issue of 'streedhan' in their separation settlement of 2016. ""There is no evidence to suggest that the claimed 'streedhan' was in the possession of the daughter's in-laws,"" the SC said.","Supreme Court rules that a woman is the sole owner of her'streedhan' The gold ornaments and other articles were given by her parents at the time of marriage.

July-Aug monsoon across India set to be among two wettest in last 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/july-aug-monsoon-across-india-set-to-be-among-two-wettest-in-last-30-years/articleshow/112906101.cms,"La Nina

, earlier slated for Aug, may now arrive only by Nov

Cyclone likely in Arabian Sea, the first in Aug since 1976

NEW DELHI: With the run of good rains continuing for over two months, the monsoon in July and Aug this year is set to be among the two wettest the country has seen in 30 years, bringing good news for kharif-crop sowing and for soil moisture in subsequent months.Rain recorded across India in July-Aug currently stands at 585mm and is expected to cross 595mm in the next two days, which will be around 11% higher than the long period average (535.4mm).This will be close to or higher than 596.1mm recorded in 2019, the wettest July-Aug in the 30 years.This follows better-than-expected rains in the country in Aug, which came on the heels of a 9% surplus in July. As of Aug 29, average rainfall across India during the month was 16% above normal. IMD had forecast Aug rains to be in normal range (94-106% of LPA).Rainfall in Aug has been beyond expectations. Weather models were predicting a 10 to14-day weak phase during the month. While rains in central India did see a dip for around two weeks, north and south India continued to receive good rainfall during this period,” said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary in the earth sciences ministry.July and Aug are the rainiest months in the country, accounting for nearly 62% of total rainfall in the June-Sept monsoon season and usually, the monsoon doesn’t perform well across both months. Last year, for instance, the monsoon was 13% above normal in July but failed in Aug, when the rain deficit was as high as 36%.Rajeevan said active MJO conditions aided the monsoon in Aug. MJO — Madden Julian Oscillation — is a pulse of stormy weather that moves eastwards along the equator, typically returning to the same spot every one to three months. MJO’s presence in the Indian Ocean usually enhances monsoon rainfall in India. Significantly, MJO had aided the monsoon in July as well.Meanwhile, the latest forecast by US agencies said that La Nina conditions, which were earlier expected to set in around Aug, may do so only by Nov. It’s expected to be weak and transitory, the forecast added. La Nina, a cooling of ocean waters in central and eastern equatorial Pacific, is another major weather condition that favours monsoon rainfall in India.“Ocean temperatures in the Pacific haven’t reached La Nina thresholds but the region remains cooler than usual and this has positively impacted the monsoon in Aug,” Rajeevan said.In a forecast released Thursday, IMD said conditions are likely to remain good for monsoon over the next two weeks.In a rare occurrence, the deep depression currently over Saurashtra and Kutch that has been causing heavy rainfall in Gujarat for the past four-five days, is set to cross into the Arabian Sea and intensify into a cyclone by Friday, IMD said.Since 1891, only three cyclones have developed in Arabian Sea in the month of Aug, the last of which was in 1976. While the storm is expected to move westwards along the coast of Pakistan and Iran, winds gusting up to 75kmph are likely along and off the Gujarat coast from Thursday to Saturday, the agency said.Simultaneously, a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal is likely to develop into a depression and move towards north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha in the next two days, IMD warned.",Monsoon in July and Aug this year is set to be among the two wettest the country has seen in 30 years. Rain recorded across India in July-Aug currently stands at 585mm and is expected to cross 595mm in the next two days.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112906230,imgsize-1093563,width-400,resizemode-4/112906230.jpg"
"PM Modi asks ministers to counter 'false' narratives, work with states on policies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-asks-ministers-to-counter-false-narratives-work-with-states-on-policies/articleshow/112905685.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all ministers and top officials to “inform” people about decisions taken by govt to counter “false narratives”, while urging them to expedite decision making at all levels.“The PM said while the govt has taken several important decisions to transform the lives of common man and people from all walks of life, there is a need to focus on keeping citizens informed to beat negative and false narratives ,” said a source who attended the meeting on Wednesday evening.His comment on communicating the true picture comes from the assessment in govt of opposition’s claims like the one during general elections that BJP’s pitch for over 400 seats was to amend the Constitution— a charge that was dismissed as untrue—need to be strongly countered.Chairing the first meeting of the council of ministers in his third term, Modi told ministers and mid-level central govt employees to spend 2-3 days every year in aspirational districts.During the five-hour meeting, Modi urged ministers and officials to learn to work when the country has abundant resources, manpower and experts. The PM said this is a sharp contrast to how the country lived with scarcity.Sources said the PM emphasised on the need to think big and fast track decision-making for rapid development across all sectors. In a sarcastic remark on bureaucrats moving files from one table to another, Modi compared this with pilgrimage. Quoting the PM, a source said, “Char Dham yatra ke baad humein toh moksh mil jaata hai, par files ko 16 dham darshan ke baad bhi moksh nehin milta (After pilgrimage of Char Dham we attain salvation, but files don’t get this even after travelling through 16 desks).”Modi also asked ministers and top civil servants to involve state govt officials for seamless implementation of plans and schemes. His remark came after going through presentations of two groups of secretaries on infrastructure and social welfare, which detailed the roadmap for the next five years and for 2047.He also asked the top bureaucrats to carry out an assessment for restructuring manpower in each department and ministry and also to focus on capacity building of all employees, including the multi-tasking staff. Govt has rolled out iGOT Karmayogi, an online learning platform for capacity building of all employees.TOI has learnt that during interaction, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said that while earlier people used to visit Delhi to see India Gate, Red Fort and Qutub Minar, now the national capital has got more attractions including, the New Parliament, National War Memorial and PMs Museum. “He suggested that cities with iconic structures or elements should be leveraged in branding them like Paris around the Eiffel Tower. There are around 60 plus cities, which can be developed on that model,” said an official.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all ministers and top officials to ‘inform’ people about decisions taken by govt.

"Amid China standoff, India set to boost naval power with 3rd N-sub in 6 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-china-standoff-india-set-to-boost-naval-power-with-3rd-n-sub-in-6-months/articleshow/112905487.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to commission its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in another six months to further bolster its sea-based leg of the nuclear weapons triad, after the second such boat was formally inducted into the Strategic Forces Command as INS Arighaat at Visakhapatnam on Thursday.The third SSBN, which is now undergoing trials ahead of her commissioning as INS Aridhaman early next year, is slightly bigger than the first two, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, and consequently capable of carrying more long range nuclear-tipped missiles.Significantly, INS Arighaat is also capable of carrying some K-4 missiles, which have a strike range of over 3,000-km, unlike her forerunner INS Arihant that is armed only with the 750-km range K-15 missiles, sources told TOI.This is crucial for credible strategic deterrence amid the continuing military confrontation with China. Capable of staying submerged for months on end, SSBNs are the most secure, survivable and stealthy platforms for second-strike capabilities, which in turn deter an adversary from launching a surprise first strike.The commissioning of INS Arighaat, which has a 6,000-tonne displacement and four silos on its `hump’ for the vertical launch of missiles, was conducted at the secretive ship-building centre in Vizag, with defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi and DRDO chief Samir Kamat in attendance.“INS Arighaat will further strengthen India’s nuclear triad, enhance nuclear deterrence, help in establishing strategic balance and peace in the region, and play a decisive role in the country’s security,” Singh said.Recalling former PM Vajpayee’s `political will’ that put India on a par with nuclear weapon states by conducting the Pokhran-II tests in 1998, Singh said, “It is essential for us to develop rapidly in every field, including defence, especially in today's geopolitical scenario. Along with economic prosperity, we need a strong military. Our government is working on mission mode to ensure that our soldiers possess top-quality weapons and platforms made on Indian soil.”Indigenous technological improvements on INS Arighaat make it “significantly more advanced” than its predecessor Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018. “The two together will enhance India’s capability to deter potential adversaries and safeguard its national interests. INS Arighaat’s hull and size may be the same as INS Arihant but she is a much more capable version with lot of internal engineering upgrades,” an official said.INS Aridhaman and the fourth under-construction SSBN, in turn, will be even more potent. With a 7,000-tonne displacement and 125-metre long, they will be able to carry a larger number of K-4 missiles.The four submarines, built under the classified advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched in the 1990s at a cost of over Rs 90,000 crore, are of course less than half the size of the SSBNs of countries like the US, China and Russia.China has six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, apart from six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs, meant conventional warfare). The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.India is also working on a plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors. Parallelly, as was reported by TOI earlier, a Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ SSNs, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations. It will take at least a decade to construct them.","India plans to commission its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in another six months.

Government to launch ‘repairability index’ for electronics by December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-launch-repairability-index-for-electronics-by-december/articleshow/112904540.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt will launch a ‘ repairability index ’ for mobile phones and electronic products by Dec, a move that will help consumers make informed decisions before purchasing them. The initiative aims to address the growing e-waste problem and encourage manufacturers to produce more easily repairable items.Speaking at a workshop on ‘Right to Repair Framework’ organised by the govt, Union consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said after the roll out of the index, the department will come up with a regulatory framework as well.“As India emerges as the third largest economy in the world, we should have a vibrant and tech-savvy repair system,” she said. Top industry players attended the meeting and supported the govt’s move.The ‘repairability index’ is a display or information that manufacturers will have to put on electrical and electronic equipment to inform about their repairability. Sources said once the regulatory framework is notified, manufacturers in India will have to mandatorily display them like in France.The proposed index will rate products on criteria including availability of technical documents, ease of disassembly, spare parts availability and pricing of spare parts. It will assess various elements that determine how easily a product can be repaired and thereby ultimately promoting a circular economy and reducing e-waste.Officials said the repairability index would score products on a scale of 1 to 5. The lowest score of 1 will be given to products that have increased risk of getting damaged and require dismantling of multiple components to access a single part. Products that offer a compromise, making some components easily accessible while others requiring more complex disassembly will get the score of 3 while items that are easy to repair as they allow direct access to parts like battery or display without unnecessary removal of other components will get the maximum score of 5.In an official statement, the consumer affairs department said that the workshop was aimed at establishing a consensus among industry stakeholders on “key parameters for accessing and evaluating repairability index” besides promoting longevity in product design, and democratising repair information to enhance consumer experiences in reusing the mobile and electronics products they own.HCL Technologies founder Ajai Chowdhry called for legislation to drive the change. “Today, most products are not repairable. We need to design products which can be repaired... Unless we create a law, things will not change,” he said.The govt has launched a ‘Right to Repair’ portal, with 63 companies onboard, including 23 from the mobile and electronics sector. India is the third largest electronic waste producer globally after China and the US.","The initiative aims to address the growing e-waste problem and encourage manufacturers to produce more easily repairable items.

Government allows sale of FCI rice for ethanol production; revokes curb on sugarcane juice & syrup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-allows-sale-of-fci-rice-for-ethanol-production-revokes-curb-on-sugarcane-juice-syrup/articleshow/112904424.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday lifted a 13-month ban on sale of rice to grain-based ethanol distilleries by allowing such entities to purchase up to 23 lakh tonnes of the foodgrain through e-auction till October, a move that will boost ethanol production and offload excess stock held by Food Corporation of India. The government had banned the sale of rice for ethanol production last year.In another decision just ahead of the Maharashtra assembly election, government also revoked the restriction on use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup for ethanol production, which was imposed last December.As per a notification issued by the food ministry, it permitted sugar mills to use cane juice or syrup to produce ethanol for the ethanol supply year (ESY) 2024-25, beginning November 1.According to the food ministry, grain-based ethanol producers can participate in e-auctions and purchase FCI rice between August and October 2024 under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). The ministry said ethanol manufacturers can purchase rice through weekly e-auctions and the purchases are subject to ethanol allocation by oil manufacturing companies.FCI has been conducting e-auctions for rice sales to private traders since last July to manage the surplus inventory. The current stock of rice with FCI is more than 540 lakh tonnes, which is over three times more than the required buffer stock. The agency had been staring at the problem of storing fresh crop just ahead of the upcoming harvest season.This move signals a shift in the government’s stance on using foodgrains for biofuel production as it balances food security concerns with the need to manage excess stocks.So far as the decision with regard to sugar mills are concerned, the ministry, in a notification, said, “Sugar mills and distilleries are allowed to produce ethanol from sugarcane juice/sugar syrup, B-Heavy molasses as well as C-Heavy molasses during ESY 2024-25 as per the agreement with OMCs.”The food department in coordination with the petroleum ministry will periodically review the diversion of sugar to ethanol production vis-a-vis the production of sugar in the country, so that year-round sugar availability for domestic consumption is maintained, the notification said.The government has set a target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. The sugar mills body, Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association, has welcomed the decision. Its director general Deepak Ballani said this is a significant relief for the industry.",Government lifts a 13-month ban on sale of rice to grain-based ethanol distilleries. Food Corporation of India will be able to purchase up to 23 lakh tonnes of the foodgrain through e-auction till October.
