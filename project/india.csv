Nyay Patra: Congress vows to scrap Agnipath scheme If voted to power

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday penned a letter to President Droupadi Murmu expressing concerns over the Centre's decision to privatise Sainik schools in the country.Requesting a complete reversal of the policy and cancellation of related MoUs, Kharge highlighted the traditional separation of armed forces from partisan politics in Indian democracy, which he believes has been compromised by the government.He emphasised that the ideological influence in these institutions could harm their inclusive nature and national identity. Kharge urged for the withdrawal of the privatisation plan and scrapping of the agreements to preserve the ethos and character of Sainik Schools.Citing an investigative report based on an RTI response, he raised alarms about the alleged ownership of a significant number of these schools by leaders affiliated with the BJP-RSS.""Having undermined institutions after institutions, in the grand plan of RSS to hurriedly thrust its ideology, they have dealt a body blow to the very nature and ethos of the Armed Forces. Imparting ideologically slanted knowledge in such institutions shall not only destroy inclusiveness but also damage the national character of the Sainik Schools, by influencing their character through partisan religious/corporate/family/social/cultural credos.""Therefore, in national interest, the Indian National Congress demands the complete rollback of this privatisation policy and annulment of these MoUs, so that children studying at Armed Forces Schools retain desired character, vision and honour required for the service of the nation,"" Kharge wrote.Noting that there are 33 Sainik Schools in India, he pointed out that they were previously government-funded and operated under the Sainik Schools Society, a body under the ministry of defence.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge expresses concerns over the Centre's decision to privatise Sainik schools in the country.

NTA: Voting will not affect their eligibility to take examinations; asks candidates to ignore rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nta-voting-will-not-affect-their-eligibility-to-take-examinations-asks-candidates-to-ignore-rumours/articleshow/109200887.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency ( NTA ) on Wednesday clarified that voting in the general election will not affect the eligibility to appear in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or any other exams conducted by it. This strange clarification had to be issued by the agency due to a message going viral in social media that candidates with inked fingers post exercising their franchise will not be allowed to take the exam.NEET-UG is scheduled for May 5, 2024, which falls during the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls window starting from April 19 to June 1, 2024.However, there are no polling dates in any part of the country between April 27 and May 6, 2024.The Common University Entrance Test-undergraduate ( CUET-UG ) will be conducted between May 15 to May 31, 2024 and there are two polling dates (May 20 and 25), which are falling in this window. However, NTA has not yet announced the exact exam dates.Stating that the messages going around in the social media as baseless and the Agency has not issued any such guidelines, the public notice, stated that “…there are messages circulating in social media, claiming that individuals who vote in the General Elections to the Lok Sabha and have their fingers inked will be prohibited from entering examination halls of the examinations conducted by NTA,” adding, “Students are requested not to pay heed to such rumours and exercise their voting right. Voting will not affect their eligibility to take examinations.”Like the last few years, demand for postponement of NEET has also started on social media. Advising the candidates to focus on their studies and prepare for the forthcoming examinations, a senior NTA official said: “This has become an annual feature. The exams are announced well in advance and especially for NEET-UG the first Sunday of May has been the rule. Such demands are backed by coaching centres for their financial interest.”","The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate) is scheduled for May 5, 2024, which falls during the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls window starting from April 19 to June 1, 2024.

NEW DELHI: After two consecutive terms in power, even the most popular governments start losing support but India stands out as an exception where popular support for the ruling government is increasing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Newsweek in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in which he is seeking a third term.Narendra Modi is set to become the first PM to be on the Newsweek cover after Indira Gandhi.During an interaction with the editors of the magazine, PM Modi addressed recent attacks by opposition parties about deteriorating freedoms and democracy. ""There are a few people in India and in the West who have lost [connection with] the people of India—their thought processes, feelings and aspirations. These people also tend to live in their own echo chamber of alternate realities. They conflate their own dissonance with the people with dubious claims of diminishing media freedom.""He added that India was a democracy, ""not only because our Constitution says so, but also because it is in our genes"".Apart from listing great strides that India has made in its infrastructure since BJP came to power in 2014, PM Modi also talked about the country's rise as an economic powerhouse and its competition with China.Contending that India is a natural choice for those looking to diversify their supply chains, the PM said the Centre has undertaken transformative economic reforms such as GST, corporate tax reduction, bankruptcy code and more to significantly improve ease of doing business.""Given our strengths, India is now globally considered most suited for manufacturing world-class goods at competitive cost. Apart from producing for the world, the vast Indian domestic market is an added attraction. India is a perfect destination for those who want to set up trusted and resilient supply chains,"" he said.Taking on accusations of mistreatment of minorities, PM Modi said such allegations are ""usual tropes of some people who don't bother to meet people outside their bubbles"".""Even India's minorities don't buy this narrative anymore. Minorities from all religions, be it Muslim, Christians, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain or even a micro-minority like Parsis are living happily and thriving in India,"" said PM Modi.""For the first time in our country, our government has come up with a unique saturation coverage approach when it comes to schemes and initiatives. They are not restricted for a group of people belonging to a particular community or a geography,"" the PM told the editors of Newsweek.On border dispute with China, PM Modi said ties with Beijing is important and significant. ""We need to urgently address the prolonged situation on our borders so that the abnormality in our bilateral interactions can be put behind us,"" he said, adding: ""I hope that through positive and constructive bilateral engagement at the diplomatic and military levels, we will be able to restore and sustain peace and tranquility in our borders.""On Pakistan, PM Modi said India has always advocated for advancing peace, security and prosperity in the region in an atmosphere ""free from terror and violence"".Asked to comment on criticism over revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, PM Modi said that for the first time people in J&K ""have a new hope in their lives"".""Post the revocation of Article 370, the region has become a welcoming destination for global events, hosting significant gatherings like the Formula 4 racing event, Miss World and G20 meetings. Digital economy, startups, innovation and smart solutions are taking wings,"" he added.PM Modi also shared his thoughts on what makes a good leader and that 'listening' is the most crucial quality.""Listening is an important quality for leadership. I am god-gifted with this quality, and I have also cultivated it. Another quality that I have is that I am always in the moment. I am not distracted by phone calls, messages or anything else. When I am doing something, I am 100 percent involved and engrossed in that task.""""For leaders, I feel it is important that they have a bottom-to-top feedback channel. A leader should have the ability to connect to the grassroots and get unfiltered feedback. There should also be multiple such channels of feedback, so that human biases and preferences get neutralized,"" he added.""I am also a firm believer in delegation of work. I spend long hours understanding and discussing important matters and developing consensus. Once there is consensus, I believe in empowering people to execute it,"" the PM told Newsweek.",Narendra Modi is set to become the first PM to be on the Newsweek cover after Indira Gandhi.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Delhi minister and Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) leader Raaj Kumar Anand on Wednesday resigned from his cabinet and party post, stating that he does not want to be associated with a party ""involved in corruption"".Reacting to the sudden resignation, AAP said this was yet more evidence of how the BJP was using central probe agencies to break up the party.""Anand was earlier called corrupt by the BJP but now he will join the same party ... BJP is using ED, CBI to break our ministers and MLAs, it's a test of AAP ministers and MLAs,"" AAP MP Sanjay Singh said at a press conference.""I want to tell you that this is Raaj Kuman Anand, on whom ED conducted a raid for 23 hours in November last year. The BJP was alleging him of being corrupt. Whether it is JP Nadda, Anurag Thakur or Piyush Goyal, everyone was accusing him of being corrupt. Now, we just have to wait and watch, whether the BJP, that had accused him (Raaj Kuman Anand) of being corrupt, will welcome him in their party or not?"" he added.AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said the resignation further proved that the Centre was trying to break up the party as well as the AAP governments in Delhi and Punjab.""Time and again we said that the intention behind arresting Arvind Kejriwal was to break the party and governments of Delhi and Punjab. This was said time and again by Kejriwal,"" he said.""Many of our colleagues will feel that we hate Raaj Kumar (Anand) and will call him dishonest and cheater. We will not say any such thing. I believe that he is a family man who is afraid of the threats of ED and Tihar Jail, not everyone is Sanjay Singh. I believe that he was scared, many times he told his party colleagues that 'as soon as I become a little active, I get a phone call,"" said Bharadwaj.""Everyone knows that there was an ED raid at his residence. He was under pressure and got scared. We have no complaints from him ... He was given a script and he had no other option but to read it,"" he added.On his part, Anand, who is an MLA from the Patel Nagar constituency, said he quit the party over concerns of corruption in AAP. ""Aam Aadmi Party was born to fight corruption but today the party is stuck in a swamp of corruption. It has become difficult for me to work on the minister's post. I resigned from the post of minister and from the party as I can't connect name with this corruption,"" he said.""From Jantar Mantar, Arvind Kejriwal had said that the country will change once the politics changes. The politics hasn't changed but the politician has changed,"" said Anand, who was holding various portfolios including social welfare.In response to a query on the timing of his resignation, Anand said: ""It is not about the timing. Till yesterday, we were under the impression that we are being framed, but after the high court verdict, it seems that there is something wrong at our end.""He also alleged that Dalit MLAs, minister or councillors of the AAP were not given due respect in the party.""I became a minister to pay back the society. I don't want to be part of a party that takes a backseat when Dalit representation is talked about,"" he said.""We have 13 Rajya Sabha MPs, but none of them are Dalit, women or from backward classes. There is no respect for Dalit MLAs, councillors and ministers in this party. In such a situation, all Dalits feel cheated. Due to all this, it is difficult for me to remain in this party,"" he said, adding that he is not joining any other party.","Raaj Kumar Anand says he does not want to be associated with a party ""involved in corruption"" AAP says this is yet more evidence of how the BJP was using central probe agencies to break up the party.

NEW DELHI: Jailed Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said he was ready to bear all ""atrocities of this dictator government "" as long as it serves to "" save the Constitution "".The message was conveyed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) minister Gopal Rai, after he along with other prominent party leaders, including Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann , MP Sanjay Singh , and AAP members Sandeep Pathak and Saurabh Bharadwaj , convened to meet Sunita Kejriwal at the Delhi CM's residence.Sunita had met her husband in Tihar jail on Tuesday and relayed his message at the meeting.""Today, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, MP Sanjay Singh, Sandeep Pathak, Saurabh Bharadwaj and I came here to meet Sunita Kejriwal.

How BJP coined popular taglines to run successful poll campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/how-bjp-coined-popular-taglines-to-run-successful-poll-campaigns/articleshow/109110774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ruling BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going all out to seek a third straight term in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and the battle cry this time is ""Ab ki baar 400 paar"" coupled with the “Modi ki guarantee.”In fact, popular tag lines and catchy slogans have been an integral part of BJP’s electoral journey right from 2014 when it stormed to power with the poll cry ""Ab Ki baar Modi Sarkar"".The BJP centred its campaign around alleged corruption and price rise under the Congress-led UPA government, promising ""Ache Din"", which the opposition claims never came in the last 10 years.In late 2013, when reports on corruption, inflation, unemployment and national security dominated the discourse -- BJP, under its anointed PM candidate Narendra Modi, meticulously shaped its poll narrative around ""Acche Din Aane Waale Hain"" (good days are about to come).A one-liner like ""Abb Ki Baar Modi Sarkar"" did magic for the party as it easily turned into lucrative couplets, which connected with the masses in the form of humour, sarcasm and even jibe at the ruling UPA led by the Congress party.The emergence of social media around 2014 gave perfect impetus to this poll strategy of the BJP, and consequently, the party achieved its historic mandate by winning 282 seats of the 543 Lok Sabha seats.In 2019, when the BJP was preparing its report card to ensure a return to power, the opposition launched a stinging attack on the central government over the Rafale fighter jets deal between India and France.The opposition leaders, mainly the then Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, alleged that the deal involved a ""tainted transaction"" as it bypassed conventional procedure.In the backdrop of the Rafale controversy, the Congress scion drew an analogy that the chowkidaar (watchman) of the country was himself the chor (thief) for having given alleged undue advantage to his ""capitalist friends"". The Congress hit out at PM Modi with the "" Chowkidaar Chor Hai "" jibe.Retaliating to the Congress's attack, the BJP launched a counter-campaign "" Meh Bhi Chowkidaar "", under which the PM and other BJP leaders, including supporters added Chowkidaar as the prefix to their name on social media. PM changed his name to Chowkidaar Narendra Modi. The same was followed by other ministers.Interestingly, the ""Meh Bhi Chowkidaar"" campaign became Twitter's top trend worldwide, hours after PM Modi launched it.Continuing with his effort to put Rahul Gandhi on the backfoot over his ""Chowkidaar Chor Hai"" jibe, the Prime Minister also took potshots at Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of denigrating the community of watchmen.PM Modi said since his rivals lacked the guts to name him directly, they are resorting to slogans which have put every watchman under the cloud.Additionally, the Prime Minister gave out -- Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai (with Modi, everything is possible) – slogan ahead of the 2019 national polls, stressing the action he ordered against Pakistan and his development records.This ""Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai"" became one of the key poll planks of the BJP. The air strikes in Pakistan dominated most of Modi’s speeches.He said his government avenged the Pakistan-orchestrated attack, unlike the Congress government that did nothing after the 26/11 Mumbai attack and held back the security forces from taking decisive actions in the national interest.On the same lines of turning the opposition's attack as its campaign theme, the BJP in 2024 has used RJD's supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav 's dig at PM Modi's family as one of the summer polls premises.Lalu Yadav, while addressing an INDIA bloc rally in Patna, lashed out at PM Modi for raising the issue of dynastic politics and asked why the PM doesn’t have a family.PM Narendra Modi, in a retort, said that 140 crore Indians are his family, which set off a massive ""Modi Ka Parivar"" campaign by top BJP leaders in what was seen as a strong counter to Lalu Prasad’s “Modi has no family” remark during his party’s rally in Patna.Currently, the BJP has been running its poll campaign on the ""Modi Ki Guarantee"", highlighting the promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he fulfilled.PM Modi said that the ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" means the guarantee of fulfilling guarantees, which has also become a focal point of the campaign.BJP has incessantly been using the ""guarantee"" plank to list out the promises fulfilled by the central government, including the major ones like the Ram Mandir inauguration, Article 370 abrogation and the CAA implementation.While the possibility around the achievability of the set target remains debatable, one thing that has been at the heart of BJP's functioning is its successful attempts to push against the political attacks and jibes through its popular campaigns.","Ruling BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going all out to seek a third straight term in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The battle cry this time is ""Ab ki baar 400 paar"" coupled with the “Modi ki guarantee”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109110760,imgsize-4158964,width-400,resizemode-4/109110760.jpg"

Why US doesn't want Ukraine to attack Russian oil facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-us-doesnt-want-ukraine-to-attack-russian-oil-facilities/articleshow/109191305.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday, cautioning Ukraine against targeting Russian oil refineries. He suggested that such attacks could inadvertently escalate global oil prices amid an already tense global energy situation. Austin emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine focusing its military efforts on tactical and operational targets directly influencing the current conflict.This stance sparked disagreement from Senator Tom Cotton , who argued that the Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure have been effective.He insinuated that the Biden administration's concerns might be more about preventing a rise in gas prices during an election year than about global energy stability.The controversy arises as global oil prices hit a six-month high, a situation the US attributes to conflicts in the Middle East and asserts that its sanctions and price cap on Russian oil have been effective. However, Russia reports an increase in oil exports in 2023 compared to pre-conflict levels, challenging the narrative of sanctions' impact.Reports have surfaced suggesting the US had previously urged Ukraine to halt its refinery attacks, with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy indicating that the US reaction to the strikes was ""not positive."" Despite this, Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) has declared plans to expand operations against Russian oil refineries, a Russia Today report said.The drone attacks, initiated by Ukraine over the past two months, aim to disrupt Russian military fuel supplies and ""deliver a symbolic blow by bringing the war closer to Moscow,"" according to Kiev. Zelenskyy has also framed these strikes as a form of deterrence, citing a shortage of missiles for Western-provided air defenses.Both Zelenskyy and Austin are lobbying the US Congress for over $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine. Zelensky warns that without this support, Ukraine's defeat is certain, while Austin views the aid as a boon for American workers in the military industry. The proposed ""national security supplemental"" funding would benefit at least 30 federal states, supporting industries ranging from ammunition to submarine manufacturing.",US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin voiced concerns during a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the White House Tuesday, kicking off a state visit featuring a major upgrade in defense ties against a resurgent China.A gala dinner and Rose Garden press conference are on the menu for the formal part of the visit on Wednesday, in a sign of the value Washington places on an increasingly self-confident Japan .The two leaders are expected to unveil plans to restructure the US military command in Japan -- the biggest upgrade to defense cooperation since the 1960s -- to make them more responsive against threats in the Asia-Pacific region.Kishida, 66, the first Japanese leader to receive full honors from a US president since Shinzo Abe in 2015, arrived on Tuesday night at the White House with his wife Yuko.Biden, 81, and First Lady Jill Biden then took the Japanese couple to a swanky restaurant in Washington's upscale Georgetown area.Jill Biden said the visit would ""celebrate the flourishing friendship between the United States and Japan.""""Our nations are partners in a world where we choose creation over destruction, peace over bloodshed, and democracy over autocracy,"" she told reporters during a preview of Wednesday's state dinner.The Japanese visit underscores the importance Joe Biden places on building alliances against countries such as China, Russia and Iran in an increasingly uncertain world.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the two leaders would ""announce measures to enhance security cooperation, to enable greater coordination and integration of our forces.""On Thursday Biden will host the first ever trilateral summit between Japan, the Philippines and the United States to further expand alliances against China in a critical region.But hanging over the US and Japanese leaders will be the thorny topic of a Japanese takeover of US Steel, a deal opposed by Biden as he faces a tough reelection battle against protectionist former president Donald Trump.The formal summit kicks off Wednesday with a grand welcome including military bands, followed by an Oval Office meeting and a joint news conference between Biden and Kishida in the Rose Garden.The Bidens will then host a gala dinner which will see the grand East Room of the White House transformed into what Jill Biden called a ""vibrant spring garden.""On Thursday, Kishida will address both houses of Congress before he and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos convene with Biden.They are the latest Asia-Pacific allies to be hosted by Biden, who was joined by Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David last August.Biden has also moved to manage tensions with China, holding a two-hour phone call with President Xi Jinping last week and a face-to-face meeting in San Francisco in November.According to media reports, Biden and Kishida could agree to the biggest upgrade in US-Japan command and control structures in decades.This would make their two militaries more nimble in a crisis, for example a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, experts said.The US has 54,000 military personnel in Japan who must report back to Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, around 6,500 kilometers (4,000 miles) away and 19 hours behind, for joint operation matters.The two countries may also agree to allow large US warships to undergo repairs at private shipyards in Japan, and to joint production of defense equipment, according to media reports.Staunchly pacifist for decades, Japan has in recent years made ""some of the most significant, momentous changes"" since World War II, US ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said ahead of the visit.","US President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the White House.

US lawmakers urge release of Russia critic Kara-Murza on the anniversary of his imprisonment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-urge-release-of-russia-critic-kara-murza-on-the-anniversary-of-his-imprisonment/articleshow/109171844.cms,"WASHINGTON: Members of Congress on Tuesday called for the immediate release of Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. as lawmakers marked the second anniversary of his imprisonment , part of the Kremlin's sweeping crackdown on critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""The bottom line is that Vladimir Kara-Murza will not be forgotten,"" Democratic Sen.Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at an event on Capitol Hill. ""We are going to work to set him free and to set Russia free.""Kara-Murza, a journalist and opposition activist, was jailed in April 2022 and convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence handed down to a Kremlin critic in modern Russia. He is among a growing number of dissidents held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's political crackdown.Cardin was joined by a bipartisan group of members from both the House and Senate, seeking to increase the pressure not only on Russian authorities to force the release of Kara-Murza, but to ensure that the Biden administration continues working to force his release as the U.S. has done in previous cases of Russian political prisoners.Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the committee, renewed his call Tuesday for Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate Kara-Murza as a ""wrongfully detained person,"" an appointment that would help elevate his case and provide resources to his family in America as they fight for his release.The charges against the dual Russian-British citizen stem from a March 2022 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he was critical of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Kara-Murza, who twice survived poisonings that he blamed on Russian authorities, has rejected the charges against him as punishment for standing up to Putin and likened the proceedings to the show trials under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.Vladimir Kara-Murza's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, who lives in the U.S. with their three children, joined lawmakers at the event in pleading for her husband's release.""I want to thank each and every one of you here for joining with me in my fight, not just for Vladimir's freedom, but truly for his life,"" she told the crowd.Evgenia Kara-Murza has said that her husband has spent months in solitary confinement, a punishment that has become common for Kremlin critics and is widely viewed as designed to put additional pressure on them.Most recently, Kara-Murza had been held in a penal colony in the Omsk region, though his supporters said in late January that he apparently was no longer there.","Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. was jailed in April 2022 and convicted of treason.

Canada's spy agency reveals Chinese interference in 2 elections won by Justin Trudeau,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadas-spy-agency-reveals-chinese-interference-in-2-elections-won-by-justin-trudeau/articleshow/109158363.cms,"'No India role'

China involvement

China interference

in Lok Sabha polls

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Canada's domestic spy agency has determined that China interfered in the nation's last two elections, according to testimony in an official probe, providing the strongest evidence to date of suspected Chinese involvement in Canadian politics.A document prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), titled Briefing to the Prime Minister’s Office on Foreign Interference Threats to Canada’s Democratic Institutions, stated: ""We know that the PRC clandestinely and deceptively interfered both in the 2019 and 2021 general elections."" PRC refers to the People’s Republic of China.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party emerged victorious in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.It also added that a panel of senior Canadian officials monitoring the 2021 elections in the country were not informed of any attempt by India at influencing those national polls.The absence of such a foreign interference (FI) alert was cited by the Canadian news outlet Globe and Mail’s senior parliamentary reporter Steven Chase, as he posted on X: ""Panel of bureaucrats that monitored 2021 election tells foreign interference inquiry they were not informed of any potential FI activity from India during the 2021 campaign.""India has repeatedly denied involvement in such activities in Canada.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had stated: ""We strongly reject baseless allegations of Indian interference in Canadian elections . It is not our policy to meddle in other countries' democratic processes ... In fact, Canada has been interfering in our internal affairs.""India was mentioned during the hearings and by CSIS for alleged foreign interference in Canada, along with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. China is considered the primary player in such activities by Canadian authorities.Under pressure from opposition legislators concerned about media reports regarding China's potential involvement, Trudeau established a commission to investigate foreign interference.The commission was presented on Monday with a slide containing an excerpt from a February 2023 briefing from the Canadian Security Intelligence Services (CSIS).The briefing said, ""We know that the PRC (People's Republic of China) clandestinely and deceptively interfered in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.""""In both cases, these foreign interference (FI) activities were pragmatic in nature, primarily aimed at supporting individuals perceived as either 'pro-PRC' or 'neutral' on matters of interest to the PRC government .""The existence of the assessment had previously been reported by Global News. China denies interfering in Canadian politics.Erin O'Toole, who led the Conservatives during the 2021 campaign, estimated that Chinese interference may have cost his party up to nine seats. However, he added that it had not altered the outcome of the election.""State actors can carry out foreign interference successfully in Canada due to minimal legal or political consequences. As a result, foreign interference poses a low-risk, high-reward scenario,"" the assessment stated.Intelligence analysts and the Conservatives argue that Trudeau's government has not taken sufficient measures to address Chinese interference.Trudeau is scheduled to testify before the commission on Wednesday.The Conservatives, known for adopting a tougher stance on China compared to the Liberals, campaigned in 2021 on a platform that denounced Beijing's treatment of the Uyghur minority and pledged to prohibit Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from involvement in the 5G network.A legislator from the left-leaning minority New Democrats informed the inquiry that after she began criticizing Beijing's policies regarding Hong Kong, invitations to events organized by the politically influential ethnic Chinese community dwindled.According to the official 2021 census, Canada has approximately 1.7 million people of Chinese descent, constituting just under 5% of the total population.The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the CSIS statement.Canada announced last year that a Conservative legislator with family ties to Hong Kong had been subjected to an online disinformation campaign, leading to the expulsion of a senior Chinese diplomat.A Microsoft analysis has revealed that Chinese cyber and influence operatives, along with North Korean cyber agents to a certain degree, are likely to focus their efforts on interfering with India's Lok Sabha polls.In a detailed analysis by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it has been revealed that Chinese cyber and influence actors have been actively engaging in espionage and influence operations across various regions.","Canada's domestic spy agency has determined that China interfered in the nation's last two elections, according to testimony in an official probe.

"Sensex hits 75,000, was at 25,000 when PM Modi won 10 years ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-hits-75000-was-at-25000-when-pm-modi-won-10-years-ago/articleshow/109176567.cms,"‘75k to act as springboard for growth’

MUMBAI: A little over 38 years after it was launched with a base of just 100 points, BSE sensex, the most watched stock market bellwether in India, crossed the 75,000-point mark on Tuesday, signifying past successes of Indian economy and the market, and raising hopes for more wealth creation in the years ahead.On Tuesday, sensex opened the session above the 75k mark - at 75,124 points - also its new all-time peak, but some profit-taking at those levels pulled it down to close at 74,684, down 59 points on the day.On NSE, Nifty, too, scaled a new life-time peak at 22,768 points during early trades but closed at 22,643, down 24 points.The slide was partially owing to investors' nervousness about expected US inflation data due Wednesday, more so after recent high-employment data released last week, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services. An uptick in US inflation reading could delay rate cuts by its central bank and put global investors on the backfoot.For sensex, the 75k milestone came a day after BSE went past a major landmark - scaling the Rs 400-lakh-crore market capitalisation. In the last 10 years, since Modi-led NDA govt came to office, investors' wealth, measured by BSE's market cap, has gone up by five times.According to Sarvjeet Singh Virk, co-founder & MD, Finvasia, a tech-driven financial services firm, sensex at 75k not only reflects past successes of Indian markets but also “acts as a springboard for future growth, instilling confidence in investors who are now poised to embrace the promising journey ahead”.Among successes of the past decade were India’s move from being a $1.7 trillion market cap economy to a $4.8-trillion one now, setting up one of the world’s fastest settlement systems (T+1), one of the fastest IPO processes that involves retail as well as institutional investors and the most vibrant derivatives trading system in terms of number of contracts.All these, along with a market system that is increasingly opening up access to even small and medium enterprises to list on the bourses at a reasonable cost, and the rise of the retail investors as a major investing group (through the mutual fund route) give every investor confidence to put their money in the Indian market, industry veterans say.Looking forward, June 4 results of Lok Sabha elections will be the prime determinant of the market’s trajectory for the following few months. Additionally, the interest rate scenario in the US and other major economies, progress of monsoon in India (private forecaster SkyMet has predicted good rains for 2024), corporate results, foreign fund flows and economic fundamentals will also have a major impact on investor sentiment, market players said.In short term, investors’ focus will shift to earnings delivery as stock prices are factoring in reasonable growth during the earnings season that’s starting this week, said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities PMS. “If the earnings season turns out to be disappointing, then the market will correct. However, if there are more upgrades than downgrades, the market will continue to move upwards.”","BSE sensex, the most watched stock market bellwether in India, crossed the 75,000-point mark on Tuesday. ‘75k to act as springboard for growth’ says Sarvjeet Singh Virk, co-founder & MD, Finvasia, a tech-driven financial services firm.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109178679,imgsize-1323338,width-400,resizemode-4/109178679.jpg"
