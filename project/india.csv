Prosecutors said that the landowner left the injured worker and failed to call for an ambulance.The tragic death of Satnam Singh left Italians in shock and triggered demonstrations by unions and farm workers, who demanded improved working conditions.Calls for end of the exploitative ""caporalato"" system, which involves the use of underpaid migrant labor in Italy's agriculture sector have grown since the incident.President Sergio Mattarella has also commented on the case, referring to the ""cruel"" exploitation of workers like Singh and the ""inhuman"" conditions that seasonal farmhands often face in Italy.Carabinieri police in Latina, an agricultural province south of Rome, arrested farm owner Antonello Lovato after prosecutors elevated the initial suspected crime from manslaughter to homicide with ""malice afterthought,"" according to a statement from Latina prosecutors.The decision was made after a forensic report established that Singh died from ""copious blood loss"" and that he ""most likely"" would have survived if he had received prompt medical care. However, an ambulance was not called immediately after Singh's arm was torn off when it became caught in a nylon-wrapping machine.According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, the arrest warrant signed by Judge Giuseppe Molfese said that Lovato was operating the tractor that was pulling the nylon-wrapping machine and then left the bleeding Singh outside his home.Italian news reports have cited witnesses claiming that Lovato refused requests by Singh's wife, who also worked at the farm, to call an ambulance, asserting that he was already dead. A neighbor eventually called an ambulance, and Singh was taken to the San Camillo hospital in Rome, where he was declared dead approximately two days later.Latina prosecutors said that Singh's condition after the injury was so critical that it was evident he required immediate medical attention. The statement said, ""At the present time, therefore, it must be held that the decision to omit the necessary care constituted acceptance of the risk of the lethal event and united the cause that directly resulted in death.""",Indian migrant Satnam Singh died after his arm was severed by a piece of farm machinery.

In one such moment, the India captain walked up to the pitch, got down on his haunches, picked up a speck of soil from the track and ate it.The moment reminded of tennis legend Novak Djokovic eating a strand of grass from the Wimbledon centre court after one of his triumphs at the famous Grand Slam event. But Rohit insisted his move wasn't ""scripted"", rather it was ""instinctive"".Speaking on a video the BCCI recorded during Rohit's photoshoot with the trophy, the India captain shared the emotions that took him to the centre of the ground.""Nothing was scripted; it was all coming instinctively. I was feeling the moment,"" said Rohit in the video shared by BCCI on social media.""...because that pitch gave us this (T20 World Cup), we played on that particular pitch and we won the game on that particular ground, I will remember that ground and that pitch forever in my life. So I wanted to have a piece of it with me. Those moments are very, very special; and the place where all our dreams came true, I wanted something of it. That was the feeling behind it,"" he said.India won the final by seven runs in a last-ball finish, coming back from a point where South Africa seemed to have the game in hand, requiring 30 of 30 balls while chasing India's 176 for 7. But Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah struck crucial blows, helped by Suryakumar Yadav's stupendous catch, in the dying stages to turn the tide and limit the Proteas to 169 for 8.""The feeling actually is surreal,"" Rohit further said. ""I would say it still hasn't sunk in totally. It's been a great moment, right from when the game got over till now. It feels like a dream...Although it has happened, it feels like it hasn't happened. That's the emotion, that's the feeling you have.""We had dreamt about it, worked hard as a unit for such a long period of time. To see this now with us, we feel quite relieved as well because when you work hard for something and you eventually get it in the end, it feels really really nice.""The skipper went on to add that the party went deep into the night, and that he will catch up on sleep once he gets home. However, a hurricane around Barbados has delayed the team's departure. The T20 champions are now expected to arrive back home on Tuesday or Wednesday.""Last night, we were having a good time, had a blast with the teammates till very early morning. So I would say I didn't sleep properly, but that's absolutely fine for me. Not to sleep after a day like that, I am totally fine (with it). There is a lot of time for me to go back home and sleep. So I am going to catch up on that,"" said 37-year-old Rohit, who became the oldest captain to win the T20 World Cup.At the post-match press conference, Rohit went on to announce his retirement from T20Is, a decision that Virat Kohli had also taken soon after the end of the final.""Like I said, this moment was very, very special for all of us, and I want to live it, each moment, each minute, each second that is passing by, I want to make the most of it,"" concluded Rohit, with the T20 World Cup trophy on his side.","Rohit Sharma ate a speck of soil from the track after India's T20 World Cup win.

NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks.

Sarcastic comment sparks Jagdeep Dhankhar-Mallikarjun Kharge spat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarcastic-comment-sparks-jagdeep-dhankhar-mallikarjun-kharge-spat/articleshow/111443833.cms,"'Never Ever In History...': Kharge's Fiery Argument With Jagdeep Dhankhar In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between Rajya Sabha chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday after the former sarcastically told Congress member Jairam Ramesh to take the latter’s post of LoP.Kharge, who is a Dalit, said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull”.An agitated Dhankhar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.The acrimonious exchange began when Congress member and deputy LoP Pramod Tiwari was attacking the govt for “betrayal” on multiple fronts during the motion of thanks on the President’s address. When Dhankhar told Tiwari not to make unverified claims, Ramesh interjected to say that they would be authenticated.“The senior leadership (Kharge) is here. I think you (Ramesh) should replace (Kharge).... You are so intelligent, so gifted, so talented, you should immediately come and take the seat in place of Kharge because, by and large, you are doing his job,” the chairperson said.Kharge promptly retorted: “Don’t bring in the Varna system. It is still in your mind... that is why you are saying Ramesh is very intelligent... and that I am dull so that I should be replaced.”Accusing Kharge of “twisting” his statement, Dhankhar said he did not mean anything like that. “You cannot run down the Chair all the time. Never in the history of Parliamentary democracy and Rajya Sabha proceedings, has there been such disregard of the Chair. I have a lot of patience and tolerate so much,” Dhankhar said.Adding that Ramesh was always passing some comment or the other, the Chairperson said, “There is a problem which you have to solve.” Pointing to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi sitting next to him, Kharge said it was she and the people who had made him LoP, “not Jairam Ramesh or you”.","Kharge said Dhankhar was bringing in the “Varna” (caste) system by calling Ramesh “intelligent and gifted”, and by implication labelling him “dull” DhankHar then rapped Kharge for “twisting” his remarks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111443898,imgsize-68886,width-400,resizemode-4/111443898.jpg"

I have seen you asking members to troop to the well. Such behaviour is unwarranted on your part,"" Birla said.Opposition MPs, mostly from Congress, started protesting from both sides of the well and continued heckling the PM during his entire over two-hour speech. As soon as Modi rose to speak, opposition members, amid relentless sloganeering, urged the Speaker to allow an MP from Manipur to speak. As Birla said one of them had already been given an opportunity to speak, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi along with two Manipur MPs rushed to the well. Later, several Congress MPs entered the well, while TMC members stood on the aisles voicing their support.Modi, however, braved the continuous heckling by Congress MPs. Breaching the well and protesting from the sides of the treasury bench was seen as a serious breach of decorum and parliamentary norms as the MPs were sloganeering just in front of the PM. It was also a rare occasion as the entire treasury bench remained silent and did not confront the protesting MPs even for once.Although the PM completed his reply with full throttle, he urged the Speaker that he should not take the opposition's behaviour lightly and also look at how the House will run in the next five years.Later, Lok Sabha passed a resolution condemning opposition's disruptions during Modi's address, with Union minister Rajnath Singh saying these actions ""shredded"" parliamentary norms and decorum. ""I propose that the House condemns this action,"" Singh said. Birla said, ""I gave sufficient time to all members. I gave more than 90 minutes to the leader of the opposition but this behaviour is not in line with parliamentary norms.""The resolution was seconded by home minister Amit Shah and was passed by a voice vote.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla named and reprimanded the newly appointed leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: Confusion. Screams. Fear. Chaos. Hundreds of people gathered to listen to ' Bhole Baba ', a self-styled godman, in a small village of Uttar Pradesh's Hathras on Tuesday, without realising that in no time they would witness the horror of their lives.A stampede broke as the devotees started to leave at the end of a 'satsang' (prayer meet) organised in Pulrai village.Over 100 people died in the incident and several others were injured.Shakuntala, an eyewitness , recalled how people started falling one after the other as the crowd started to run in a rush.

Entire India under monsoon cover 6 days before schedule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/entire-india-under-monsoon-cover-6-days-before-schedule/articleshow/111440961.cms,"NEW DELHI: Southwest (summer) monsoon covered the entire country on Tuesday, six days before its normal date, said India Meteorological Department on Tuesday. It’s the third consecutive year in which the monsoon covered the entire country by July 2.The onset of monsoon over Kerala and most parts of northeast happened simultaneously on May 30 ahead of its normal date of June 1 and June 5, respectively.It covered the entire country in 34 days despite its sluggish progress during June 10-18. Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days .Early/delayed onset or early/delayed coverage, however, doesn’t impact quantitative or spatial aspects of rainfall during the four-month monsoon season. It, however, guides the progress of kharif (summer sown crops such as paddy, sugarcane, coarse cereals and cotton) sowing operations and choice of crops as farmers have to take a call on the basis of the irrigation cycle a crop may need.IMD records show that this is the seventh time in the past 12 years and 14th time in the past 25 years that the monsoon covered the entire country ahead of time, with the earliest one being recorded in 2013 when it did so as early as June 16 — the day country witnessed a major disaster in Kedarnath (Uttarakhand).Monsoon normally starts retreating from northwest India around Sept 17 and fully withdraws by Oct 15. Besides farming activities, water and hydro-power management also depends on the onset, coverage and withdrawal of monsoon.Though June recorded nearly 11% deficit rainfall in the country, it did not affect the overall acreage last month due to adequate pace of sowing operations in peninsular India which reported over 14% more than normal rainfall in the month.Agriculture ministry data shows that the overall acreage of all kharif crops put together in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares which was 59 lakh hectares more than the acreage during the corresponding period last year. It happened due to higher acreage of the less water consuming crops — pulses and oilseeds — last month.","The onset of monsoon over Kerala and most parts of northeast happened simultaneously on May 30 ahead of its normal date of June 1 and June 5.

"" ... and when the logic fails, start crying,"" the PM said.In another instance, while calling out Rahul Gandhi indirectly for his ""childish behaviour"" , PM Modi used the famous dialogue 'tumse na ho paega' from the movie 'Gangs of Wasseypur'.

'Overcrowding led to stampede'

NEW DELHI: In a horrifying incident, over 100 people were killed after a stampede broke out during a ' satsang ' (religious prayer meeting) in Uttar Pradesh 's Hathras .Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken note of the incident and formed a committee to investigate the incident.The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba , formerly known as Saurabh Kumar.According to Navbharat Times report, the baba had previously served in the intelligence department of Uttar Pradesh Police.After 17 years of service, he quit his job to embark on spiritual journey as a preacher. He is often seen giving lessons in white suit and tie.He organises satsang programs with his wife and is also known as 'Sakar Vishwa Hari Baba of Patiali'. Hundreds of people usually attend his events.While his following extends beyond UP to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, both the preacher and his acolytes maintain a distance from the media.According to a devotee, Bhole Baba had no religious mentor and soon after he took voluntary retirement from service, he had a 'vision' of the deity and since then he became inclined to spiritual pursuits. He used to hold his satsangs every Tuesday and before Hathras, he held a similar event in Mainpuri district last week.He courted controversy during the Covid pandemic period when he sought permission for a satsang in Farrukhabad district in May 2022 to be attended by only 50 people. However, the congregation grew to over 50,000, causing a major headache for the local administration.As per reports, the stampede in the Hathras event on Tuesday broke out as servitors of Bhole Baba stopped people from leaving the venue amid the heat and humidity, so that the preacher and his retinue could leave first. As permission was given to people to leave, chaos broke out, leading to the stampede.Victims, dead or unconscious, were brought to the Sikandara Rao Trauma Centre in trucks and other vehicles. The bodies were laid outside the health centre as people milled around them.One video clip showed a woman crying, sitting among five or six bodies in a truck. Another picture showed a man and a woman lying lifeless in another vehicle.Eyewitness Shakuntala Devi told PTI Videos that the stampede took place while people were leaving the venue at the end of the satsang. They fell atop each other, she said.The stampede apparently occurred due to overcrowding, Sikandra Rao police station SHO Ashish Kumar said.According to officials, a team comprising the Agra additional director general of police and the divisional commissioner of Aligarh will probe the incident.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the stampede and instructed officials to reach the accident site and carry out relief measures. He announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh ex gratia for the families of the dead and Rs 50,000 each for the injured.","The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba.

He was questioned about the Bali trip when he was kept in a Jharkhand jail. “CBI is verifying his travel details, his spendings during the duration of the trip, and all bank transactions,” an official said.CBI has already found information of Haque being in contact with the Bihar paper-leak gang. “His call details reveal connections with numerous individuals, necessitating a thorough investigation,” the official said.","New evidence purportedly emerged of arrested principal Ehsanul Haque ’s alleged shady dealings.

"PM Modi hits back in LS: Congress a ‘parasite’, Rahul ‘childish’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-attacks-cong-says-party-trying-to-push-nation-into-throes-of-anarchy/articleshow/111444115.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a furious attack on Congress and Rahul Gandhi , saying the opposition party and its “ecosystem” had been trying to spin its third consecutive electoral loss as a “moral victory” even as it had emerged as a “parasite”, and the newly-appointed leader of opposition was exhibiting childish exuberance (“baalak buddhi”).“No matter how much you shout and scream, the mandate is very clear, you have to again sit in the opposition,” said Modi amid consistent heckling by members of Congress that led Speaker Om Birla to reprimand Rahul Gandhi for directing MPs to occupy the well in front of the PM.Replying to the motion of thanks on the President’s address in Lok Sabha, Modi said, “It would have been better had Congress understood the message instead of indulging itself with fake victory celebra tions which cannot gloss over the fact that it is the third time in a row that the party has failed to get a triple-digit score and that the June 4 verdict marked Congress’s third worst-ever performance.”Modi also took on Rahul for “childish whining”, referring to his complaints about being wronged by the Spea ker. “Like the boy who comes from school to whine to his mother that he has been bullied, but who would never admit his own mistake, a fresh drama is being enacted to garner sympathy,” he said, referring to the ongoing cases against Rahul.Defying the consistent sloganeering from opposition members which at times threatened to drown his voice,PM Modi on Tuesday drew upon famous dialogues from popular Bollywood movies to dismiss the estimate about June 4 being the coming-of-age moment for Rahul Gandhi. “The ecosystem is, much like mausi in Sholay, trying to flatter the party by saying that you may have lost again, but you have scored a moral victory,” said Modi.“But the people have seen through it and have a simple message, inse na ho payega (you just don’t have it in you),” the PM said, borrowing the famous line from ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, something that sparked a flurry of memes on social media. The PM was replying to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address.“Just like the whining child who would never acknowledge that he had tore somebody’s book, abused another, called the teacher a thief and stole somebody’s lunch... Similarly, it is not disclosed that he (Rahul) is on bail in a cheating case involving thousands of crores, that he has been convicted for maligning OBCs, that SC held him guilty of making irresponsible statements and that he is facing trial for maligning Veer Savarkar,” said the PM in the fiercest direct assault on Rahul. The leader of opposition is on bail in the money laundering case related to the alleged National Herald scam.He also reiterated his protest over Rahul’s attack on “those who call themselves Hindus”. Modi said the effort to establish an equation between Hindus and violence was well deliberated. “A conspiracy has been hatched to target the community... People will not forgive this for centuries.”Modi said use of images of deities for personal political interests marked an “insult to our Gods”. He added, “Hindus have to decide whether what happened was just coincidence (sanjog) or part of a deliberate effort (prayog)”.The Prime Minister also had tough words for the “ecosystem” — BJP’s shorthand for Congress supporters among the intelligentsia.“The habits of the ecosystem, flourishing for 70 years, the way they have decided to stop the nation’s progress, and derail its development, I want to warn them... that the answer to all their conspiracies will be given in their language. This country will never accept anti-national conspiracies,” he said.He accused Congress of trying to push the country into the throes of anarchy by pitting regions and castes against each other. “Now they are encouraging their govts in states to take measures which are not feasible. This is part of a dangerous game to create anarchy.”","PM Narendra Modi launches a furious attack on Congress and Rahul Gandhi.

Due to large pendency of cases in the courts, disproportionate ratio of judges vis-a-vis population, routine adjournment of cases merely on asking of an advocate and lack of use of technology, more particularly in lower courts, are big constraint in maintaining the timelines provided in the law for deciding cases,"" said former law secretary PK Malhotra.Though Section 346(2) of BNSS gives unfettered powers to a judge to adjourn hearings even after commencement of trial ""for such time as it considers reasonable..."", in Section 346(2)b, the BNSS for the first time limits the adjournments to two: ""where the circumstances are beyond the control of a party, not more than two adjournments may be granted by the court after hearing the objections of the other party and for the reasons to be recorded in writing.""The directives to limit adjournments have been issued earlier too by the apex court to subordinate courts but these are seldom followed.Quoting from the findings of a 2017 study by Bengaluru-based legal think tank Daksh, TOI had earlier reported that an average 87 cases got listed each day before a subordinate court judge, and almost half of them were adjourned. ""This is far too many, given that the judge sits in an open court for only about five-and-a-half hours.

Govt makes a new category of ‘combo’ three-wheeled vehicle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-makes-a-new-category-of-combo-three-wheeled-vehicle/articleshow/111440692.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a gap of nearly six years, govt has added a new category of vehicle, L2-5. This ‘combo’ category of three-wheeled vehicle can be used interchangeably as a two-wheeler or a three-wheeler, as per requirement. These vehicles can now be registered with transport authorities across the country.It was in Nov 2018 that the govt had included ‘quadracycle’ as a new vehicle in the four-wheeler class, though it has not found many takers.Officials said creating new categories of vehicles and allowing their registration are aimed at promoting innovative transportation solutions .The ‘combo’ vehicles can be used for personal and commercial purposes.As per the current automotive standards, the combo vehicles would be electric-powered only. Sources said new standards can be included if any manufacturer opts for using any other fuel. The ministry in July 2022 had initiated setting the standards for this category of vehicles.As per a road transport ministry notification, a combo vehicle “means a three-wheeled motor vehicle, with a 2 wheeler-3 wheeler combination module, constructed in such a way that a two-wheeled vehicle of category L2 is combined with a non-self propelled rear module unit”.Though it’s a detachable combination of a two- and three-wheeler, there would be one single registration number for both the vehicles. But each of the vehicles would have two number plates, one in the front and the other in the rear side.Sources said the new category of L2-5 has the potential to meet the requirement of a section of users considering the flexibility to use the vehicle as per their requirement. For example, in congested areas, the owners can detach the three-wheeler portion and use it as a two-wheeler. Those who run a shop or a small commercial entity, they can use it as a three wheeler to carry goods. At the workplace, they can detach the two-wheeler and use it for commuting.","After a gap of nearly six years, govt has added a new category of vehicle, L2-5.

The HC will continue hearing the matters on Wednesday.","The Bombay high court said that the state backward class commission headed by the former HC Judge, Justice S B Shukre, was a necessary party to be heard in one of the PILs.

The case from 1720 that CJI D Y Chandrachud highlighted to underscore the importance of following the rule of law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-case-from-1720-that-cji-d-y-chandrachud-highlighted-to-underscore-the-importance-of-following-the-rule-of-law/articleshow/111439731.cms,"MUMBAI: Rama Komathi , during pre-Independence India, was a wealthy and influential resident of Bombay as it then was, known also for his philanthropy and public spiritedness. Till one fine day in 1720, he stood convicted based on ""fabricated evidence"" for allegedly conspiring with a naval pirate. His case stands as one of the earliest Notable Trials in the annals of law, during the British regime in India.The trial is ‘notable’ not for its fairness but the contrary, as Chief Justice of India Chandrachud highlighted on Monday at an event in New Delhi.Rama Kamath, was better known as Rama Komathi. Some write his name as Kamati.His ties were said to be close with the erstwhile East India Company. He was known to be the only Indian from Bombay to get an invite to the inauguration of the Cathedral of St. Thomas.In his later years, however, he was charged as an alleged traitor and an allegedly dangerous conspirator; and stood trial before a tribunal of the Company. He was charged with being in secret correspondence with Kanhoji Angre. Letters alleged to have been addressed by Rama to Kanhoji were intercepted and seized. The charge was that he had allegedly conspired to seize the then Governor of Bombay and deliver him to Kanhoji who was considered a “menace to the security of Bombay.’’The only evidence against Kamati was “hearsay evidence'' of a girl that he conspired with Angre. Hearsay evidence is not good or admissible evidence. The other evidence was a statement of his ‘servant’ who was allegedly “tortured’’. Based on it he was sentenced to life imprisonment, his large warehouse in the Fort area was allegedly demolished, his properties seized and “auctioned”. He died eight years later in prison. It was later ""conclusively proved outside court'' that the letters were fabricated and the case against Kamati was false, said the CJI Chandrachud.The then Governor Charles Boone presided over the Tribunal, wrote the two lawyers. The legal principle of no man can be a judge in his own case, was given a go by said lawyers.“This case was tried in what might be called a process far removed from the modern notion of rule of law-- where equality under law and principles of natural justice and fairness form the backbone of justice ,’’ says solicitor Dhaval Mehta, of DM Legal Associates who in 2021 had posted on social media an article from another website in 2009 by a Chennai based lawyer Prakash Yedhula on the Kamati case.The first Earl of Chatham William Pitt, and Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1766-678 is attributed to have famously said , “…the end of law is the beginning of tyranny,"" to stress on the importance of rule of law . Kamati’s misfortune was that he was tried when the modern legal systems were in their infancy and he, a sacrificial lamb of sorts, was caught in public miscarriage of justice.Mehta said the case offers crucial judicial lessons. It underscores the importance of ensuring due process, impartiality, and reliable and admissible evidence in trials to ensure justice itself is not sacrificed. “The historical case serves as a reminder of the necessity for robust legal safeguards to protect individual rights and maintain the integrity of the judicial system,’’ he said on Tuesday.","Rama Komathi was a wealthy and influential resident of Bombay as it then was, known also for his philanthropy and public spiritedness.
