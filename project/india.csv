NEW DELHI: Navdeep Singh , the Paralympics gold medalist, shared a powerful story of resilience and triumph at the Paris Games. Initially securing a silver medal, Navdeep’s achievement was later upgraded to gold, marking a historic milestone in his athletic career. His remarkable performance in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games brought immense pride to the nation.However, the road to his success was filled with personal challenges, which Navdeep opened up about during an emotional podcast interview.Born with dwarfism, Navdeep endured severe criticism and societal rejection throughout his life. In the podcast, he revealed the hurtful taunts he faced because of his condition. He shared how some people went as far as to suggest that he should consider suicide, dismissing his potential and undermining his worth.“Aapko kya lagta hai hume hausla kaha se aata hai? Jab wo bolte hain ki tu kuch nahi kar sakta. Isse acha to tu suicide kar le. Ye kya jeewan hai tera [Where do you think we get our courage from? When they say you can't do anything. It's better if you just commit suicide. What kind of life is this for you?],” Navdeep recalled, recounting the harsh words he had to endure.Instead of breaking him, these brutal comments only fueled Navdeep’s determination to prove his critics wrong. His gold medal at the Paris Paralympics wasn’t just a victory in sports, but a bold statement against discrimination and doubt.Navdeep’s triumph came when he launched the javelin to a distance of 47.32 meters in the final, clinching the prestigious gold medal. His victory silenced those who doubted his ability due to his condition.During the podcast, Navdeep also became emotional when discussing his late father, who had been a pillar of support throughout his journey.“Shuruwat unhone karwai thi. Har jagah saath they [He was the one who got me started. He was with me every step of the way],” Navdeep said, reflecting on his father's impact, though he is no longer alive to witness his son's ultimate success.","Navdeep Singh won gold in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games.

It will be a reality.""In his Independence Day address last month, PM Modi had made a strong pitch for one nation-one election, contending that frequent polls were creating hurdles in the country's progress.The functionary, who didn't wish to be named, also said groundwork for holding the census has begun - it is the first time that govt has confirmed the likelihood of census being conducted shortly, as well as the possibility of including caste in the exercise. ""This (caste count) is yet to be decided,"" the functionary said.The last census with a caste column in it was conducted in 1931, with govt doing away with the exercise after independence. The first phase of this decade's census was expected to begin on April 1, 2020 but had to be postponed due to Covid-19. Implementation of the Women's Reservation Act , enacted by Parliament last year, too is linked to the census.The law reserving one-third of seats for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies will come into effect after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken based on the first census recorded after the Act came into force. The functionary said govt is confident that its legislative agenda will be successfully passed and it was naive to say govt was soft and that there was pressure from allies, citing tough decisions like waqf board reforms, which have been initiated to bring transparency, which was a ""blow to the politics of appeasement"".Meanwhile, this census exercise will be the first digital one giving citizens the opportunity to self-enumerate.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh govt suspended Sunday three senior IPS officers on charges of framing, arresting and harassing a Mumbai-based actress earlier this year in an alleged attempt to coerce her withdraw a sexual assault complaint in her home city. This is possibly the first time so many senior IPS officers have been suspended in the state in one go for alleged misuse of power and dereliction of duty.The action against PSR Anjaneyulu, Kanthi Rana Tata and Vishal Gunni was taken following an inquiry report which outlined significant lapses and misuse of power by them.SV Rajashekara Babu, commissioner of police in NTR district, submitted the inquiry report to DGP Dwaraka Tirumala Rao . Anjaneyulu is former intelligence chief, Tata former NTR district police chief and Gunni former NTR district rural DCP.Two other officers, former ACP Hanumanth Rao and former Ibrahimpatnam circle inspector Satyanarayana, were suspended earlier in the case.The actress lodged a formal complaint Friday. In her complaint, she accused the three IPS officers of conspiring with Kukkala Vidyasagar , a local businessman and YSRCP leader, to register a false case against her. The actress, along with her elderly parents, was arrested from Mumbai on Feb 2 and released on bail after 42 days in jail.According to her complaint, the false case was part of a larger conspiracy to force the actress into withdrawing the sexual assault complaint she had filed against an individual in Mumbai. Vidyasagar allegedly forged documents and produced false witnesses to frame the actress.The actress also claimed that during her detention, the cops denied her and her parents legal rights, refused access to relatives or lawyers, and subjected them to severe physical and mental harassment. She claimed the officers threatened her with more false cases in other states. ""This has taken a devastating toll on our mental and physical health. We were left suffering from anxiety, depression and panic attacks,"" the actress stated in her complaint.","Andhra Pradesh govt suspended Sunday three senior IPS officers on charges of framing, arresting and harassing a Mumbai-based actress.

Delhi elections are due in Feb (2025) but I demand that the elections be held in Nov along with Maharashtra...I will sit in the CM's chair only after people give me a certificate of honesty. I want to go through the 'agni pariksha' (trial by fire) after coming out of jail,"" he said, referring to Sita undergoing the test after Lord Ram and she returned from exile.Experts, however, claimed that Kejriwal cannot call for early elections without first recommending dissolution of the assembly.If that happens, it will be the prerogative of Election Commission to take a call on whether the elections could be held early. The assembly polls are due to be held in Feb 2025.Alleging that BJP had tried to prove he was corrupt, Kejriwal claimed the saffron party could not provide good schools and free electricity to people because they were corrupt. ""We are honest,"" he asserted. ""They slap false cases against non-BJP chief ministers. If the CMs are arrested, I urge them not to resign but to run their govt from jail,"" he said.""I didn't resign (after arrest in the excise policy case) because I respect democracy and Constitution is supreme for me,"" he said. Referring to his decision to quit as CM in 2014 over Jan Lokpal Bill, just 49 days after assuming power, the CM said, ""I resigned then for my ideals. I do not have lust for power.""Pointing out that the excise policy case will drag on for a long time, the CM said he will tell the people of Delhi to vote in his favour only if they considered him honest. ""For me, BJP is not important, people are important,"" he said.""Our leaders Satyendar Jain and Amanatullah Khan are still in jail. I hope they come out soon,"" he said as he thanked god ""who was with us through difficulties"". About his time in jail, Kejriwal referred to letters written by freedom fighter Bhagat Singh while in British captivity and said, ""I wrote only one letter to the lieutenant governor from Tihar and was issued a warning.""""Our freedom fighters were allowed meetings with colleagues but my party colleague, Sandeep Pathak, was not allowed to meet me in jail,"" he said.Kejriwal said some people were saying that Supreme Court had imposed some conditions and that they won't be able to do any work. ""In the past 10 years, these people have left no stone unturned in imposing conditions. The LG imposed various conditions and the central govt snatched my power by imposing one law after another, but I did not let your work suffer. These conditions do not create any obstacle for us,"" he said.Sources in the party said the CM would leave his official residence on Flag Staff Road which was at the centre of a controversy with BJP accusing Kejriwal of spending excessively on its construction. That virtually rules out his wife, Sunita Kejriwal, succeeding him.BJP and Congress, however, said Kejriwal had resigned out of compulsion and was trying to take the moral high ground. Leader of the opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said that with restrictions imposed on his functioning by Supreme Court, Kejriwal will neither be able to attend office, nor sign any files. His resignation will allow him to focus on campaigning for the upcoming Haryana elections with the party looking to expand its footprint with the Delhi elections after that early next year.Sources said there were several schemes and policies, such as Mahila Samman Nidhi Yojana - which promises Rs 1,000 as financial grant to women aged above 18 years -- dearness allowance for daily wagers and new electric vehicle policy, among others that AAP govt would like to roll out. And the party is apprehensive that the LG would question Kejriwal calling important meetings and accessing official documents which may lead to a stalemate in governance.",Arvind Kejriwal says he will quit as Delhi chief minister after two days. He ruled out former deputy CM Manish Sisodia succeeding him.

""At the start of our govt, we did have some rough patches (with India), you know,"" Zameer was quoted as saying by a Maldivian newspaper. He added these ""misunderstandings"" had been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops. Interestingly, the day Muizzu's office announced his visit to India, the Maldivian media also reported that two junior ministers who had made derogatory remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year had resigned from the govt.""We have good relations with both China and India, and both countries continue to support Maldives,"" he said, while thanking both countries for their support at a time international credit agencies were warning about the country's financial health.Zameer said that the Maldives has no plans to seek an IMF bailout , dismissing the current economic challenges faced by his country as ""temporary."" He said, ""We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation. I seriously don't think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF. The issue that we have is very temporary because currently, we are having a dip in reserves.""China was reported this week to have pulled the Maldives from the brink of a financial crisis with a bilateral agreement that will apparently act a framework for cooperation in ""promoting the settlement of current account transactions and direct investments in local currencies"".""China will, as always, provide support and assistance to the economic and social development of the Maldives within its capability,"" said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.","Ties between the two nations have seen dramatic improvement since India replaced its military personnel, who manned Indian govt's relief choppers and aircraft, with civilian staff.

RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: PM Modi blamed the JMM-Congress-RJD coalition govt in Jharkhand Sunday for rising insecurity among the state's indigenous population, purportedly fuelled by its refusal to acknowledge the influx of Bangladeshi and Rohingya Muslims as a demographic threat, and ""standing with them"".Modi's remark during a visit to Jharkhand, due for year-end assembly polls, came against the backdrop of the home ministry and Aadhaar's nodal agency UIDAI filing affidavits in the high court, citing infiltration in six tribal-dominant districts.""The tribal population is declining in Santhal Pargana and Kolhan divisions,"" he said in Ranchi.The infiltrators are taking over panchayati raj institutions in the area and committing crimes against our daughters.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures. Several FIRs have been filed in connection to the protests, and police injuries were reported during earlier clashes in Shimla.","Hindu groups demand action against alleged illegal construction of a mosque in Shimla.

He added, ""But, I asked why you should support me, and why should I take your support. To become the Prime Minister is not the aim in my life.

His inability to win public trust has long been evident, yet he continues to draw a ministerial salary. Perhaps those funds could be better utilised in addressing what seems to be a deeper mental affliction. Such a baseless accusation is not merely a lapse in judgement; it is a clear manifestation of a troubling disconnect between his speech and reasoning,"" Bajwa added.Bajwa said that Bittu's accusations were a clear display of irresponsibility, and he urged the Government of India to take action to ensure that those holding positions of authority maintain the ""integrity of the Constitution.""Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit also criticised Bittu, he used to praise Rahul Gandhi when he was in Congress, but now, after joining the BJP, he has swiftly shifted his allegiance to his new party.Bajwa's criticism was in response to Bittu's allegations, where he referred to Rahul Gandhi as ""the country's number one terrorist"" and claimed that Gandhi sympathised with separatists. Bittu also accused Gandhi of disseminating false information about the Sikh community while traveling abroad.""Rahul Gandhi is not an Indian, he has spent most of his time outside. He does not love his country much because he goes abroad and says everything in the wrong way. The people who are most wanted, separatists, and experts in making bombs, guns, and shells, have appreciated what Rahul Gandhi has said. The enemies of the country who try to blow up planes, trains, and roads, are in support of Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi is the country's number 1 terrorist. The biggest enemy of the country whom the agencies should catch is Rahul Gandhi today,"" he said.Bittu, a former member of the Congress party, accused Rahul of acting against the nation's interests, claiming that those who attempt to attack the country's infrastructure support Rahul.“Why are they teasing Sikhs? What do they want to do? He is speaking the language of terrorists like Pannun who are sitting abroad. I will speak the same when he is sitting in front of me in the parliament,"" he said.During his address to Indian Americans in Herndon, Virginia, Rahul had said, ""First of all, you have to understand what the fight is about. The fight is not about politics. That is superficial, the fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or a kada in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to Gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions”.

I do not have any political party connections. Sorry, if I have said anything wrong.”Srinivasan, who is also the president of the Tamil Nadu hotel owners’ association, in a lighthearted comment raised concern about the varying GST rates on food items while addressing Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during an event in Coimbatore.""Madam, a bun doesn't attract GST, but when cream is applied to make it a cream bun, it attracts 12 per cent GST. Customers now say, 'You bring the bun and cream separately, and I'll make the cream bun,'"" said Srinivasan.

Strategic move or big risk?



Will elections be held early?



'Why not resign today', asks BJP; AAP replies

A PR stunt, a gimmick: BJP and Congress attack Kejriwal



NEW DELHI: In a shock move, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday declared that he will step down from his position within the next two days, sparking speculation that assembly elections in the national capital might have be held earlier than February 2025, when the current term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is set to end. There is also the burning question of who the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will choose as placeholder CM till the elections.""I am going to resign from the CM position after two days. I will not sit on the CM's chair. In a few months, elections will be held in Delhi, and I want to make an appeal to the people. If you think Kejriwal is honest, then vote for me,"" Kejriwal told party workers, days after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the excise policy case.""If you think Kejriwal is guilty, then don't vote for me. Your every vote will be a certificate of my honesty. If you vote for me and declare that Kejriwal is honest, then only after the elections will I sit on the CM's chair. Until then, I will not sit on the CM's chair. I want to give 'agnipariksha' after coming out of jail,"" he added. Delhi elections are due in February but I demand that elections in the national capital be held in November with Maharashtra,"" he said.Kejriwal further indicated that his deputy Manish Sisodia will also return to office only after the people give a verdict in his favour. ""I will become chief minister and Manish Sisodia deputy CM only when people say we are honest,"" said the CM.Sisodia later confirmed on X that he will ""also go to the court of the people along with Kejriwal and only when the people will approve my honesty in the elections, I will sit on the chair of Deputy Chief Minister-Education Minister.""Referring to when he quit the chief minister's post in 2014 over the Jan Lokpal Bill, just 49 days after assuming power, Kejriwal said, ""I resigned then for my ideals. I do not have a lust for power.""Commenting on why he didn't resign after he was arrested in March, Kejriwal said: ""I didn't resign (after arrest in excise policy case) because I respect democracy and the Constitution is supreme for me.""Kejriwal framed his recent announcement as a moral stand, suggesting that he will not occupy the CM chair until he receives a ""certificate of honesty"" from the electorate.Election experts said the move is likely aimed at addressing growing concerns about corruption and governance under Kejriwal's leadership and also serves to rally the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its supporters around a narrative of integrity and accountability.AAP Goa head Amit Palekar said in a post on X: ""Hats off sir @ArvindKejriwal for your decision to step down as Chief Minister, placing your political future in the hands of the public, is a powerful demonstration of your commitment to honest politics. Your call for the people of Delhi to decide your fate through their votes, rather than clinging to power, highlights your integrity and transparency.""Kejriwal's resignation will however mean that the party will have to choose a placeholder CM, and probably also a deputy CM, till the time elections are held.Choosing a CM for just a few months has often led to a power tussle and big exits later, as was witnessed in Jharkhand recently between JMM's Hemant Soren and Champai Soren, and in Bihar in 2014 after JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar reclaimed the top seat from Jitan Ram Manjhi.Currently, the term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is set to end in February 2025.However, the EC has the authority to call for early elections if it deems it necessary due to extraordinary circumstances.Kejriwal's call for elections in November 2024 aligns with the electoral calendar of other states, such as Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which could provide a strategic advantage for AAP if they can capitalise on a broader anti-establishment sentiment.However, the EC has historically preferred to adhere to established electoral timelines unless there is a compelling reason to intervene. The poll panel usually assesses the stability of governance.The AAP currently commands a majority in the legislative assembly, occupying a whopping 62 of the 70 seats.While Kejriwal's resignation may create a political vacuum, it does not automatically trigger immediate or even preponed elections.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been vocal in its criticism of Kejriwal, labeling his resignation a ""PR stunt"" aimed at salvaging his image amid corruption allegations. It also questioned the timeframe of the resignation.The BJP has a well-established political infrastructure in Delhi, and if elections are held, it could potentially benefit from a divided electorate, especially if AAP's internal dynamics lead to a weakened campaign.""This 48-hour time which he (Arvind Kejriwal) has sought is enshrined in mystery ... Why are you (Arvind Kejriwal) talking about resigning after coming out and what is the matter after 48 hours? The people of the country and Delhi want to know what is the secret of 48 hours, what all is to be settled in 48 hours?"" BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said at a press conference.""It is ridiculous for a CM who is having overwhelming majority in the Assembly. If he is having an iota of truth in his intentions and in what he is saying, then he should call the meeting of the Cabinet, resign as CM and recommend the dissolution of the Assembly,"" he added.Reacting to the BJP's allegations, AAP leader Atishi said there was a very simple reason behind the 48-hour time-frame. ""Today is Sunday and it is Eid on Monday, so the next working day will be Tuesday,"" she said at a press conference.Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari claimed that Kejriwal wants to apply the ""Sonia Gandhi model, where she made Manmohan Singh a dummy Prime Minister and ran the government from behind the scenes"".""This is a PR stunt of Arvind Kejriwal. He has understood that his image among the people of Delhi is not of an honest leader but of a corrupt leader, today Aam Aadmi Party is known across the country as a corrupt party. Under his PR stunt, he wants to restore his image...It is clear that he wants to apply the Sonia Gandhi model, where she made Manmohan Singh a dummy Prime Minister and ran the government from behind the scenes. They have understood today that the Aam Aadmi Party is losing the Delhi elections and the people of Delhi cannot vote in their name, so they want to make someone else a scapegoat,"" Bhandari said.BJP leader Harish Khurana asked the Delhi Chief Minister why he did not resign when he was in jail for the past 6 months.""If he wants to resign, then why not today? This is a drama that he will ask the people. The people are asking you if the court has given a verdict that you can't go to the Secretariat, you cannot sign a file, then what is your justification to be in the CM position?... You are a CM on bail. You are not acquitted, you are a CM who is on trial... You didn't resign when all work in Delhi stopped and you were in jail for 6 months,"" Khurana said.BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa alleged that Kejriwal is not sacrificing anything and is forced to resign due to the Supreme Court's order. Sirsa further claimed that Kejriwal had asked for two days to convince all MLAs to make his wife the Chief Minister of Delhi.""Arvind Kejriwal has announced that he will resign after two days and become the CM again when he gets a verdict from the people... This is not a sacrifice, the Supreme Court has said in the order that he cannot go near the CM's chair and cannot sign any files. Hence, you don't have an option, you are forced to resign because of the SC order.

We have been saying this for a long time that he should resign as the CM... This is a mere gimmick. This happened for the first time when an elected leader came out of jail on bail, and was asked by the SC to not go to the CMO or sign any papers... Such conditions were never imposed on any other CM... Maybe even the SC fears that this person might try to tamper with the evidence... The SC is treating him like a criminal... There is no correlation of morality and Arvind Kejriwal,"" Dikshit told ANI.",Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal says he will step down from his position within the next two days. The move has sparked speculation that assembly elections in the national capital might have be held earlier than February 2025.

"FATF flags sluggish terror funding, laundering trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fatf-flags-sluggish-terror-funding-laundering-trials/articleshow/113376954.cms,"NEW DELHI: The slow pace of trial in cases of money laundering and terror financing remains a concern with Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) scheduled to release its review report on India on Sept 19. After a recent evaluation, the Paris-based intergovernmental body had placed New Delhi in the 'regular evaluation' list.Though ED probes into money laundering and terror financing (ML&TF) & working of its reporting mechanism such as Financial Intelligence Unit and banks on suspicious transactions are appreciated by global anti-money laundering watchdog, but long pending cases in courts have been raised by the FATF as a matter of concern.Of 11 parameters, FATF has appreciated India's performance on six compliance issues while New Delhi needs to improve on five others. The parameters include scope of criminal offence of ML&TF, confiscation of proceeds of crime, customer due diligence and record-keeping, reporting of suspicious transactions and compliance, measures to be taken with respect to countries that do not or insufficiently comply with FATF recommendations, mutual legal assistance and extradition, transparency of legal system and powers of competent authorities.India was upgraded to a 'regular follow up' category in which only four other G20 countries are placed, including the UK, France, Italy and Russia. Even the US, Japan and China are in the 'enhanced follow up' list, which mandates reporting every three months. India's latest upgrade will need a review only after three years.With regard to implementation of anti-ML&TF regime as required by FATF, a report from ED revealed the agency had in last 10 years conducted 7,300 searches, arrested 755 accused and attached assets worth over Rs 1.2 lakh crore. It confiscated assets worth over Rs 15,700 crore from total attachments during this period and restituted over Rs 16,000 crore to banks and other victims after disposal of assets, all in the last few years.Over 40 extradition requests were filed by the agency against economic offenders who have fled the country, 24 red corner notices issued and four accused extradited and arrested here, including the two prime accused in the AgustaWestland money laundering case.But what is of concern, and also raised by FATF, is delayed trials in money laundering and terror financing cases, leading to very few convictions. In the last decade, ED has registered over 5,000 cases of ML&TF, but it has been able to complete investigations only in about 1,300 cases where it has filed chargesheets. Even after filing of chargesheets, the trials have not progressed much in many cases leading to less than 50 convictions so far.FATF has, however, appreciated India's performance in international cooperation with regard to providing investigation support to foreign countries in cases of terror financing and money laundering.","The slow pace of trial in cases of money laundering and terror financing remains a concern with Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) scheduled to release its review report on India on Sept 19.

'Bastar Olympics': Calling ex-Maoists & IED victims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bastar-olympics-calling-ex-maoists-ied-victims/articleshow/113376927.cms,"Officials hope 'Olympics' inject 'feel-good' factor in Maoist zone

RAIPUR: Victims of Naxalite violence and surrendered Maoists , who can't see eye to eye, may now come face to face, or even team up, in the ' Bastar Olympics ' - a one-of-its kind village games meant to bridge gaps and build hope in the Maoist-affected region.Chhattisgarh govt is organising the games from Nov 1. This unique initiative is meant to encourage youngsters, inculcate sporting spirit, and help mainstream ex-Maoists.Deputy CM Vijay Sharma, who heads the home department, told TOI the event is focused on children and youth, mainly those victimised by insurgency.""This will boost their confidence and spirit for looking forward in life. Those who perform well ...will be felicitated and govt will help them explore their field of interest,"" he said.The games come at a time when intense security ops have pushed Maoists on the backfoot and govt sees a clear path for development. Dozens of schools closed for two decades are reopening in erstwhile Maoist dens. Officials hope the Olympics will inject a feel-good factor in what's been a battleground for over two decades.An official explained to TOI that engaging Bastar youth in studies and sports will keep them away from Maoist attempts to recruit them. In a rare admission recently, CPI(Maoist) had issued a booklet where it acknowledged the difficulties in recruiting cadres due to the sustained security operations. Bastar Olympics will coincide with the general time when Maoists go around villages, seeking to rope in, or drag, youngsters into their fold.The games will begin at the block level to ensure maximum reach, Bastar range sports officer Ravindra Pattnaik told TOI. ""As per initial plan, block-level Olympics will be organised from Nov 1-15, followed by district level contests from Nov 15-20 and divisional level finals at Jagdalpur from Nov 8-30. The winners will be presented with cash prizes and mementos,"" he said.Surrendered cadres and victims of Maoist violence will play only at the divisional level, Pattnaik said. There will be four sub-categories - victims of IED blasts or Maoist violence, surrendered Maoists, junior and senior groups.The list of participants has not been prepared yet, because the detailed guidelines are yet to be finalised, said officials. Disciplines include hockey, football, kabaddi, volleyball, weightlifting (only men) and tug of war (only women). It's not usual for Maoist victims and surrendered cadres to come face to face, or together in general public.Police are careful to keep former Maoists away from the local population as far as possible, keeping them in special camps for the cooling period. 'Bastar Olympics' will be an unprecedented platform for the meeting of two sides whose relationship outside the arena is dominated by fear, pain and loss.When TOI tried to find out how victims feel about the games, those who could be contacted were extremely wary. One of them said, ""I don't have a leg. It was blown up by an IED. How will I play any game?"" Another said: ""I would be quite embarrassed. I have an amputated limb.""In Maoist-affected areas of Bastar division, villagers live in utter dread of Maoists - so much so that families dare not inform police when one of their loved ones is murdered by Maoists. Activists aren't too enthused by the games. ""It's being organised with the hidden agenda of gathering public support for the militarisation going on in Bastar which is focused on corporate loot of minerals, land and forest,"" activist Sanjay Parate said.","Chhattisgarh govt is organising the games from Nov 1.

To strengthen our movement, we will make people aware of the failures of the government and the decisions taken against the farmers.''He said, ''The next Mahapanchayat will be held on September 22 in Pipli, Kurukshetra.
