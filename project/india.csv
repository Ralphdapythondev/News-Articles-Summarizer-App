Doordarshan's 'saffron' logo sparks political slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doordarshans-saffron-logo-sparks-political-slugfest/articleshow/109465416.cms,"NEW DELHI: The visual makeover for Doordarshan 's news channels marked by a change in the colour of its logo from red to orange has sparked a controversy , with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and I&B minister locking horns over what the opposition called an attempt to ""saffronise"" the national broadcaster.Mamata slammed the move calling it ""absolutely unethical, grossly illegal, and speaks loudly of the pro-BJP bias of the national public broadcaster"" and demanded Election Commission's intervention.I&B minister Anurag Thakur, however, shrugged off the charge and suggested that Mamata's stand was in keeping with her resistance to ""anything saffron "".Prasar Bharti CEO Gaurav Dwivedi also pushed against the charge saying, ""No surprises there, your love for 'saffron' is publicly known :) Didi, Bharat Mata ki Jai."" He argued that the move was meant for visual enhancement and the colour that has raised hackles is, in fact, orange and not saffron as being alleged.Congress MP and former I&B minister Manish Tewari criticised the switch saying it was a move to assert BJP govt's control over the public broadcaster. ""This is an attempt on the part of the govt to saffronise and capture the govt institutions. The said move clearly undermines the neutrality and credibility of India's public broadcaster,"" he wrote on X.TMC MP Jawahar Sircar, who served as CEO of Prasar Bharati, also criticised the alleged saffronisation of the national broadcaster saying, ""As ex-CEO of Prasar Bharati it hurts to see the saffronisation of Doordarshan's logo - just before elections! It will influence voters, by overlaying the colour one religion and Sangh Parivar colour with a 'neutral' Public Broadcaster and a biassed Govt/Regime.""Dwivedi, however, argued that the adoption of a vibrant, visually appealing colour was part of the channel's branding and aesthetic upgrade. ""The colour is orange, not saffron,"" he clarified, further explaining, ""It's not just the logo that underwent change, the entire visual identity has been revamped. It's regrettable that people are reading more into this than necessary. We've been working on revitalising DD's look and feel for the past six to eight months.""Established on Sept 15, 1959, the national broadcaster had its logo designed by Devashish Bhattacharya, a student of the National Institute of Design.Contrary to political speculations, the broadcaster clarified that the colour change is rooted in the logo's history and aesthetic appeal. It pointed out that the original logo, chosen by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and introduced in 1976 along with theme music composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan, featured an orange hue against a green backdrop.The vice-president of Andhra BJP, Vishnu Vardhan Reddy attacked the critics saying, ""When #Doordarshan was launched in 1959, it had a saffron logo. Now, as the govt reintroduces the original logo, liberals and #Congress are outraging over it.

INDIA alliance tries to convince TMC for joint manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-alliance-tries-to-convince-tmc-for-joint-manifesto/articleshow/109465647.cms,"TMC objects to caste census in manifesto

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc to convey a sense of purpose and unity going forward in the Lok Sabha elections .Well-placed sources said efforts are on to bring TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee around by impressing upon her the urgency to put out a minimal consensus document laying out the promises of the opposition to the voters as her opposition is proving to be the main stumbling block to its release.Sources said TMC has objected to the inclusion of “caste census” in the joint document, which is in line with its earlier red flag to the flagship policy measure on social justice. However, TMC had in the past come around when the INDIA grouping in one of its meetings succeeded in putting “caste census” in its agenda document, and then also repeated it in the public rallies.For the TMC to again raise an objection to the promise that if voted to power, the opposition will hold a nationwide headcount to determine the population of OBCs as well as other communities, appears to have raised doubts in key opposition quarters behind the intention of the Bengal outfit. Sources said the TMC appears more keen to stall the joint document, and is only using “caste census” as a pretext. Meanwhile, Mamata again on Saturday accused Congress and CPM for being hand in glove with BJP in West Bengal, and said “I had coined the name INDIA, but INDIA doesn’t exist in Bengal, it exists outside the state”.Sources said there is no point in releasing a document without “caste census” because it is a key plank of the Congress manifesto, and there is an unanimity on it in the coalition barring the TMC. Else, the option is to unveil the manifesto without the TMC’s support.The joint document is also likely to have a few key flagship promises made by Congress in its manifesto, on which there is practically an agreement with other constituents of the India bloc ."," Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc.

Making a debut with development agenda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/making-a-debut-with-development-agenda/articleshow/109469253.cms,"Poomkavu, a nondescript village intersection on Konni-Chandanappally road, wore a deserted look at 4pm as sweltering heat gripped the whole atmosphere. A flurry of activities started picking up at a corner as four men past their 60s began putting up posters. A few more joined them and the first announcement vehicle seeking votes for NDA candidate Anil Antony for the development of Pathanamthitta constituency reached the spot in another 30 minutes.In the meantime, the pilot speaker was heard claiming that days are not far when the value of Indian rupee overtakes US dollars, under the next Modi govt .As the candidate's vehicle pulled in, the atmosphere was already charged up. ""Thank you all. The purpose of the upcoming election is not just to choose an MP. It's an opportunity to stand with honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to make India a developed country. When NDA wins more than 400 seats this time, one of those seats should be Pathanamthitta,"" said Anil Antony in his brief speech. Party workers took him to the autorickshaw stand nearby where he greeted them and took selfies with a few, a practice which marked such receptions throughout his campaign.Above the din of the escorting publicity vehicle, Anil said he joined BJP without any demand and his candidacy in Pathanamthitta was solely the decision of central leaders. ""Congress has degenerated into a party that works for one family. They don't have a vision and are totally obsolete,"" he said, adding that it was Modi's vision for the country that attracted him to BJP.The people, terrain and the socio-cultural and religious mix of Pathanamthitta were unique and people were desperately looking for a change, he said, as he continued waving hands at people who came out of their homes to greet the candidate. ""I'm going to win. No doubt about it,"" he said, as he brushed aside allegations against him as just political conspiracies.But how does the son of former Kerala chief minister A K Antony feel when his own father openly expressed his wish that Anil Antony should not win? ""I respect my father. But we don't talk politics,"" he quipped, without concealing his irritation over more inquisitive questions about the father-son relationship.The bachelor son of AK Antony repeated the PM's vision - 400-plus seats and development - at every reception and finally at the roadshow in Konni town.According to Anil, who promises to bring unprecedented developments in Pathanamthitta, his 'dog barking at moon' jibe was not aimed at his father. ""It's a common aphorism in Malayalam and it applies to all Congressmen harping on an obsolete ideology,"" he said.",Anil Antony is the NDA candidate for the development of Pathanamthitta constituency.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

Cases in India: First Blue Whale Challenge victim in 2017

A first-year Indian student in the US was found dead last month. It is reported that he took his own life last month while purportedly playing a game of dares called the “Blue Whale Challenge”, which became a social media phenomena a few years ago. This death, which has been widely reported as a murder, is now being investigated as “apparent suicide”.Often called the “suicide game”, the “Blue Whale Challenge” was created by Philipp Budeikin , a former convict in Russia, in 2013.It has reportedly claimed the lives of over 130 boys and girls in India, the US, China and other countries.This online challenge pressures players into self-harm and suicide over 50 days. Each day involves a “dare” which has to be filmed and shared as “proof.” These dares start easy (horror movies) but escalate to self-mutilation.The cases reported have seen young victims, who are given easy tasks initially, fostering addiction. Later, psychological manipulation keeps them engaged as dares become increasingly dangerous over 50 days.The game works by selecting vulnerable “players"" from social media by “the curator”. Blackmail and cyberbullying prevented the players’ escape.Budeikin was arrested with charges of inciting at least 16 teenagers to kill themselves. He pleaded guilty and was also sentenced to three years in prison.In India, the first victim of the deadly challenge was reported dead in July 2017, when 14-year-old Mumbai schoolboy Manpreet Singh Sahani, jumped to death from the seventh floor of a building.A Class X student in West Bengal committed suicide and his body was found in the bathroom with face covered in a plastic bag and with a cord. Another boy, son of a former minister, jumped to death in Delhi. A teenager in Kerala hanged himself to death allegedly while completing a Blue Whale challenge.The Ministry of Electronics and IT in an advisory shared in 2017 called the Blue whale game “an abetment to suicide"".","A first-year Indian student in the US was found dead last month.

Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19. Following a fake video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan endorsing a political party made rounds on the internet, a digitally manipulated clip of actor Ranveer Singh is being shared online.In the video, the actor is shown criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the centre, at the same time seeking votes for Congress.The video ends with Singh urging voters to vote for “nyaay” and the tagline 'Vote For Congress ' is seen flashing on the screen.It doesn’t take a second look to identify that the video is doctored. The lip movements of the actor in the video clearly doesn't match the audio. Notably, it is an old video shot when the actor visited Kashi, and in fact praised PM Modi for changing the face of the 'City of Ghats'.In the original video, Singh says, “I cannot express in words the experience that I have had today. I have been a devotee of lord Shiva and I have come here for the first time…” Here’s the original video:Recently, Aamir Khan filed an FIR against a deepfake video that showed him endorsing a specific political party. The actor’s office strongly denied any connection to politics or affiliation with any political party and issued a statement.“We want to clarify [that] Aamir Khan has never endorsed any political party in his 35-year career. He has dedicated his efforts to raising public awareness through campaigns for the Election Commission for many past elections,” the actor’s office said in the statement, as per news agency ANI.“We are alarmed now to see a recent viral video alleging Mr Khan is promoting a particular party. He would like to clarify [that] this is a fake and totally untrue video. He has reported the matter to various authorities, including filing an FIR with the Cyber Crime Cell of Mumbai Police,” the statement added.A video appears to be from his TV show “Satyamev Jayate,” that aired almost a decade ago.","Deepfakes, or digitally altered video and photos, have started to crop up online as India prepares to vote in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 from April 19.
