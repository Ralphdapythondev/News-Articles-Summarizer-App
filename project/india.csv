Last month was India’s hottest May in 36 years: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/last-month-was-indias-hottest-may-in-36-years-imd/articleshow/110827479.cms,"As India voted to elect its MPs to the 18th Lok Sabha over the past six weeks, sweltering heat blanketed large swathes of the country. May 2024 was the hottest May in 36 years, shows India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) data.Both April and May this year recorded high maximum temperatures and broke records across multiple stations. The average maximum April temperature this year across India was 35.6°C.This was higher than those observed in the election years of 2004 (35°C), 2009 (35.5°C) and 2014 (35.3°C), but slightly lower than the record 35.7°C observed in 2019.The average maximum temperature this May was 37.3°C, the hottest since May 1988, when the average maximum temperature was 37.4°C. IMD data shows many stations broke past records in May.On May 31, Alwar reported 46.5°C, its fourth-highest temperature. The same day, Bilaspur logged 46.8°C, its fifth-highest May maximum ever, while Bulandshahr saw 46°C, its second-highest May maximum ever.Even the hill station Dehradun experienced 43.2°C recently, its third-highest May maximum temperature on record, as per IMD.Regions towards south India experienced intense heat during initial summer, but later in the season, the unbearable heat was felt more in the north.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the director general of meteorology at IMD, explained: “During early summer (March to April), regions like Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern peninsular areas experience higher temperatures because the sun’s position is more directly overhead, providing intense solar radiation as it moves northward.By late summer (May to June), the sun is nearly directly over northern India, causing these regions to heat up significantly.” He added that IMD’s monthly forecasts had already predicted day temperatures to be above normal for most parts of the country Political analyst Vivek Singh Bagri told TOI, “High temperatures are a big factor in influencing voter turnout, as seen this time, causing a dip. Electors in the upper-middle class to middle class categories often tend to skip voting during extreme temperature conditions, whether heat or cold. Many parts of the country recorded over 40-45°C during April as well as in May. However, there are other factors that may have had a role to play too.”Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the director general of meteorology at IMD, explained: “During early summer (March to April), regions like Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern peninsular areas experience higher temperatures because the sun’s position is more directly overhead, providing intense solar radiation as it moves northward.

Inequality declined between 2011-12 & 2022-23: Government data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inequality-declined-between-2011-12-2022-23-government-data/articleshow/110826780.cms,"NEW DELHI: Inequality has reduced both in urban and rural areas across the country between 2011-12 and 2022-23, results of the Household Consumption Expenditure survey have shown.The latest data is expected to add to the raging debate over the extent of inequality in the country with some experts saying it had increased while others have said that it has shown a decline after a spike during the Covid-19 pandemic period.The Gini coefficient , a statistical measure of inequality in the population, shows a decline, from 0.283 to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country, according to the survey results.“A decline in the Gini coefficient across urban and rural areas suggests a reduction in income inequality between 2011-12 and 2022-23. Remarkably, income inequality has decreased both in industrially advanced states and in states that have not performed well in attracting businesses,” said Nilanjan Banik, professor of economics at Mahindra University.The NSSO had earlier released a fact sheet on the household consumption expenditure data. While commenting on those numbers, Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam had said that based on the household consumption survey data the poverty level in the country could be closer to 5% or less.The household consumption expenditure survey has been released after more than 10 years as the one in 2017-18 was put on the backburner due to inconsistencies in the data. The survey results are used to extrapolate poverty estimates, update GDP numbers.“The survey reveals that the share of consumption at the bottom 50% fractile classes expanded faster in urban areas during FY12 and FY23 including those at the lowest pyramid at 0-5%. In rural areas, there was also a concomitant shift though the pace was slower. There is also a pronounced decline in estimated Gini coefficient in rural and urban areas over the period. Interestingly, across states for rural areas, the estimated Gini coefficient is higher than all India for states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. For urban areas, Haryana and Kerala have higher Gini coefficient than all India. Thus states seem to be doing better on an average in terms of distribution across rural and urban areas,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India.The results also showed the Gini coefficient for various states for both urban and rural areas. The survey for 2022-23 has undergone some changes in terms of coverage of items, change in questionnaire, multiple visits for data collection and mode of data collection which has prompted some experts to raise issues linked to comparing the results of the current survey with the previous ones.The average estimated monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 was Rs 3,773 in rural and Rs 6,459 in urban India.“Thus, the per capita expenditure level in the urban areas, in nominal terms, and ignoring rural-urban differences in price levels, has been about 71% more than that in the rural areas,” according to the survey.Among the major states, MPCE is the lowest in Chhattisgarh for rural (Rs 2,466) as well as urban (Rs 4,483) sectors. It is the highest in Kerala (Rs 5,924) in rural areas and Telangana (Rs 8,158) in urban areas. Separate surveys conducted by independent think tanks have shown a decline in inequality.“India’s income inequality declined in 2022-23 for the first time since the pandemic, with the income Gini index decreasing by 23%, from 0.506 to 0.390. This improvement is primarily due to the significant recovery of the bottom 50% of households which include labourers, petty traders, small business owners, and small and marginal farmers, according to our ICE 360 survey,” said Rajesh Shukla, MD and CEO of PRICE, a private economic think tank. “Their share of total household income rose from 15.8% in 2020-21 to 22% in 2022-23. Govt welfare schemes introduced in response to the pandemic significantly contributed to the decrease in income inequality,” said Shukla.","Household consumption expenditure survey has been released after more than 10 years.

Modi and Xi will again come face to face at the SCO summit in Kazakhstan next month. There's no proposal fo a bilateral meeting between the leaders yet.China believes the impasse in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh are legacy issues and that these should not be allowed to block resumption of normal bilateral exchanges, since they predate the onset of the standoff in eastern Ladakh.

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

Modi may be keen to rope in Chirag; several new faces from BJP also likely

NEW DELHI: As the buzz about allies seeking to secure a higher share of berths and high-profile portfolios in Modi 3.0 govt persisted on Saturday, there were indications of the BJP leadership asking NDA partners to 'pare down' their demands to 'reasonable limits' while assuring that unfulfilled desires may be given due consideration at an appropriate time later.Sources said none of the crucial ministries, including the four represented on the Cabinet committee on security - home, defence, finance and external affairs - are on the table. BJP is also likely to keep education, parliamentary affairs, culture and I&B, while ensuring that the Speaker is from its own ranks.Allies may have representation of 12-15 ministers and talks are also under way with Shiromani Akali Dal.TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12) have been asked to settle for a Cabinet berth and a junior minister slot. Shiv Sena (7) and LJP (5) have each been offered a Cabinet berth. RLD (2 MPs) chief Jayant Chaudhary is expected to be part of the Cabinet. Although the BJP brass is keen to accommodate Pawan Kalyan, founder of Jana Sena (2), it's not clear whether the willingness will extend to his colleagues if the Telugu cine star refuses to shift to Delhi. Sources said a call on Jana Sena's representation may be taken in consultation with TDP boss and Kalyan's ally N Chandrababu Naidu.BJP's old ally Anupriya Patel, the Apna Dal chief who served as a minister in the earlier Modi dispensations, is seen as a certainty.The claims of both Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Bihar CM who is the sole representative of Hindustan Awam Morcha, the Mahadalit outfit that he founded, as well as NCP for Cabinet berths are considered to be strong, and will be settled by Narendra Modi.While those involved in negotiations were tight-lipped, sources said three-term Srikakulam MP Ram Mohan Naidu could be a probable for the Cabinet berth from TDP's quota. Though only 34, Naidu, son of former Cabinet minister, the late Yerran Naidu, and nephew of TDP's AP unit chief Kinjarapu Atchannaidu, is seen as a rising OBC face. Chandrasekhar Pemmasani, a doctor from the Kamma community with assets of over Rs 5,000 crore who has been elected from Guntur, could be the party's choice for the junior minister berth.Former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh 'Lallan' and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's confidant Sanjay Jha are considered favourites for the Cabinet berth, in that order.Although Rajiv Ranjan Singh is senior, former Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Jha is also a strong contender. Besides chief minister Nitish Kumar's trust, he also enjoys goodwill in BJP for the role he played in facilitating JD(U)'s return to NDA.For the junior minister berth, JD(U) is likely to consider someone from the MBC bloc, an important constituency for the party. Rajya Sabha member Ramnath Thakur, whose father, the late Karpoori Thakur, was awarded a Bharat Ratna by the Modi govt, is likely to get the nod, although the party has an array of choices to pick from.For the Shiv Sena quota, it is likely to be a toss-up between Shrirang Barne, the three-term winner from Maval, and Prataprao Jadhav, the winner from Buldhana, while Modi may be keen to bring in Chirag Paswan, whose claim to be the legatee of his father, late Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan, has been fortified with LJP sweeping the five seats allotted to it.Modi's choices are being looked forward to also for the clues they may offer regarding his response to the setback that the party suffered in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere and the success of the opposition's claims that BJP was anti-Dalit and had sought a super majority to change the Constitution to scrap caste quotas.While the suspense over inductions from among allies is expected to end on Sunday evening, when the swearing-in is scheduled, speculation over ministry-making may persist until the portfolios are announced. Whether the portfolios of CCS ministers are going to be shuffled remains a matter of intense discussion in political and bureaucratic circles which are also waiting with keen anticipation for the picks for crucial positions like principal secretary, cabinet secretary, foreign secretary, home secretary, Army chief, ED director and SBI chairman.Likely assignments for former chief ministers like Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Manohar Lal Khattar will also have a bearing on the pecking order and indicate their standing, besides being a pointer to the govt's priorities.Several new faces from BJP are also expected, with over 20 of the 71 ministers having lost the elections.",TDP (16 MPs) and JD-U (12) have been asked to settle for a Cabinet berth and a junior minister slot.

"4-member panel to review NEET-UG results of 1,563 candidates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-member-panel-to-review-neet-ug-results-of-1563-candidate/articleshow/110825527.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of education has constituted a four-member panel headed by a former Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) chairperson to review the grace marks awarded to more than 1,563 candidates in the medical entrance exam National Eligibility Entrance Test-undergraduate ( NEET-UG ). This was informed by the National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announced on Saturday.The medical/ dental entrance test results were announced on June 4, and thereafter aspirants have been alleging multiple issues, including irregularities in the exam demanding fresh examination. - Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing affiliated to the RSS, on Saturday demanded a CBI inquiry into the allegations on the NEET-UG.Many aspirants have also approached courts for relief on the matter. Meanwhile a political slugfest commenced between AAP and BJP on the exams which recorded over 24 lakh registration and 97% attendance. Earlier Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticised the government on purported irregularities in the medical entrance examination demanding a thorough investigation.According to NTA officials, the four-member panel is being mandated to submit its recommendations within a week and the results of these candidates might be revised accordingly.The move comes amid allegations of inflation of marks leading to 67 candidates sharing first rank in the exam including six from the same centre in Haryana.Demanding re-exam candidates are alleging that the grace marks awarded to make up for the loss of time at six exam centres have led to the inflation of marks and tampered with the chances of other candidates. These centres are from Meghalaya, Bahadurgarh in Haryana, Dantewada and Balodh in Chhattisgarh, Surat in Gujarat and Chandigarh.“A high-powered committee has been set up to review the results of over 1,563 candidates. The four-member panel headed by a former UPSC chairman will submit its recommendations within a week and the results of these candidates might be revised,” said Subodh Kumar Singh, director general, NTA.Singh added, “The awarding of grace marks has not impacted the qualifying criteria of the exam and the review of results of the affected candidates will not impact the admission process.”The issue also took political turn with several opposition parties raising the issue. While AAP demanded a Supreme Court-monitored SIT probe into the alleged irregularities, Congress alleged paper leaks, rigging and corruption have become an integral part of many examinations and accused the BJP of cheating youngsters and playing with their futures. The Congress in Kerala alleged that results have raised concerns about the authenticity of the national exam for medical courses, with many students casting doubt on the procedure.Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor questioned that “The people of Delhi want to know how minister Atishi took credit for the 100% results of Delhi's six specialized excellence schools in the NEET exam, while today Jasmine Shah called the emergence of six toppers from a centre in Jhajjar, Haryana, a scam?”The NTA however, denied any irregularities and said the changes made in the NCERT textbooks and grace marks for losing time at the examination centres were some of the reasons behind the students scoring higher marks.On whether the exam will be re-conducted for certain students, Singh said: “It will be decided depending upon the committee’s recommendations. The idea is to ensure that students who lost time or other students are not at any disadvantage,” while denying any paper leak and irregularities in the exam and reiterated that the integrity of the crucial test had been compromised.ABVP in a statement said that irregularities were reported on the very day of the examination from different parts of the country and solvers were caught at different places, and at some places irregularities were also found in the distribution of question papers etc. Vidyarthi Parishad stands with the legitimate demands of the NEET candidates. ABVP's national general secretary Yagyavalkya Shukla said that there is suspicion of irregularities among the candidates regarding the NEET-UG exam results, this entire episode should be investigated by CBI and strict action should be taken against the culprits.","The ministry of education has constituted a four-member panel to review the grace marks awarded to more than 1,563 candidates.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi will take oath as India's Prime Minister on Sunday for the third time at the Rashtrapati Bhawan . The oath-taking ceremony of Modi and his cabinet will be held in the presence of a large gathering of national and international dignitaries. On Friday, the President of India appointed Modi as the prime minister-designate after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda presented her with a letter regarding Modi's election as the leader of the BJP Parliamentary Party. Notably, NDA leaders also submitted their letters of support. The President will administer the oath of office and secrecy to the Prime Minister and other members of the Union Council of Ministers at 7.15 pm.The spotlight remains on allies N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar who have played an impactful role in the government formation of the NDA for the third as the BJP failed to get to the majority mark on its own. Naidu with 16 MPs and Nitish Kumar with 12 hold ace up their sleeves and are expected to bag plum posts in the NDA government. The BJP, however, is expected to keep key portfolios with itself.Meanwhile, the INDIA Bloc has claimed that the Opposition leaders have not received invites for the swearing-in ceremony . Congress general secretary KC Venugopal claimed they have not received any information from the government requesting them to attend Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony.“So far we have not received any information from the government. We have not received any invitation...foreign leaders have been invited. Being the principal opposition party and the INDIA bloc leadership, we have not been informed. I do not know what the mood of the government is,” the senior leader said.The swearing-in ceremony will be attended by leaders from India’s neighbourhood and Indian Ocean region.They include the President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe, vice president of Seychelles Ahmed Afif, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Prime Minister of Bhutan Tshering Tobgay.Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu will also attend the ceremony amid strained ties. Accepting the invite, he said he would be honoured to attend the swearing-in ceremony and his visit to India for the historic event would demonstrate that bilateral ties between the two countries are heading in a positive direction. Like 2019, India has not sent an official invite to Pakistan this time.In addition to participating in the swearing-in ceremony, the leaders will attend a Banquet hosted by President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan, on the same evening.The visit of the leaders to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his third consecutive term is in keeping with the highest priority accorded by India to its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and ‘SAGAR’ vision.The Rashtrapati Bhawan will be under a five-layered security blanket on June 9 for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. The security measures will include paramilitary personnel, NSG commandoes, drones, and snipers. As dignitaries from SAARC nations have been invited, Delhi will remain on high alert.Designated routes will be provided to the attending dignitaries for their travel between their hotels and the venue. Top leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius, and Seychelles are expected to attend the ceremony. Several hotels in the city, such as Leela, Taj, ITC Maurya, Claridges, and Oberoi, are already under security cover.The President's house and various strategic locations will have SWAT and NSG commandoes deployed.

Approximately 2500 police personnel, including five companies of paramilitary and Delhi Armed Police (DAP) jawans, will be deployed around the venue.According to sources, former Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy and two BJP MPs from the state are likely to be inducted into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet. The two BJP MPs who are expected to be inducted into the cabinet are Pratap Simha from Mysuru and Tejasvi Surya from Bangalore South. Simha is currently serving his second term as an MP, while Surya is a first-time MP who has been a vocal supporter of the BJP government at the Centre.Naidu's TDP has also asked for at least two to four cabinet births.

Electoral setbacks and BJP’s strategic win

Uncertain future for Kamal Nath and Congress

Indira ke do haath, Sanjay aur Kamal Nath

NEW DELHI: Kamal Nath, the former chief minister and a prominent Congress leader in Madhya Pradesh , is now facing challenges following two consecutive electoral defeats. These setbacks, including the defeat of his son Nakul Nath in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from the Chhindwara seat and his own failure to secure the people’s mandate in the 2023 assembly polls diminished his political stature in the state despite his long-standing influence and strong candidacy. Nakul Nath’s loss by a margin of 113,618 votes in a constituency historically dominated by the Nath family underscores the declining support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region that was once their stronghold.A series of recent events have weakened Nath's control over the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. In a significant development, former minister and close ally Deepak Saxena left the Congress party on March 22, coinciding with his son Ajay Saxena's defection to the BJP along with 400 other Congress members from Nath’s stronghold of Chhindwara.Further compounding Nath's troubles, six corporators from his camp defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), adding to the ongoing political turbulence in the state. This defection coincided with the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, which aimed to unify and energize the party base.In the recent Lok Sabha elections, Kamal Nath’s influence in Chhindwara was critically undermined when his son Nakul Nath lost by a notable margin. Chhindwara, a seat historically dominated by the Nath family, fell to the BJP, marking a shift in the political landscape. This defeat is a clear indicator of the diminishing support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region once considered their stronghold.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.The BJP's strategy to field Bunty Sahu, a long-time rival of Kamal Nath, paid off. Sahu, despite never having defeated Kamal Nath in previous contests, posed a consistent challenge and ultimately emerged victorious in 2024. The BJP's aggressive campaign in Chhindwara, which included the induction of thousands of Congress defectors, significantly bolstered their position.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.Moreover, Kamal Nath, who was the chief ministerial candidate for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, failed to secure a mandate from the people. Despite exit polls predicting a favorable outcome for him, Nath was defeated by a significant margin in a surprising turn of events. The BJP won an overwhelming victory, securing 163 seats, while the Congress was limited to just 66 seats.The recent electoral outcomes have highlighted a decline in support for the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP's clean sweep, securing all 29 seats in the state, underscores the fading influence of Kamal Nath, a once formidable figure in Madhya Pradesh politics. Kamal Nath, once celebrated as a close confidant and third son of Indira Gandhi, dubbed “,” now faces the potential of political marginalization. His reputation, once bolstered by his unwavering loyalty and close association with the Gandhi family, is now overshadowed by recent setbacks and diminishing political clout.Adding to the challenges, rumors of Kamal Nath and his son Nakul Nath defecting to the BJP further eroded their credibility and allegiance to the Congress party during the crucial phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Despite these rumors, the lack of a clear denial only fueled speculation, contributing to a dent in their political standing. As the political landscape in Madhya Pradesh continues to shift, Kamal Nath’s future in active politics appears increasingly uncertain. He now faces the arduous task of reassessing his political strategy and addressing the internal challenges within the Congress party if he hopes to remain a relevant force in the state’s evolving political arena.","Kamal Nath, the former chief minister and a prominent Congress leader in Madhya Pradesh, is now facing challenges following two consecutive electoral defeats.

For a strong and vigilant opposition, those who want to protect the Constitution also... should be safe under the leadership of Rahul as LOP.""Also, Sonia Gandhi was re-elected as the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party by Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs, who would now nominate the leaders in the two Houses. While Kharge is set to stay on as the LOP in the Upper House, the possibility of Rahul taking up the top responsibility in the LS is open.As an upbeat Congress wrapped up the inhouse formalities in the wake of electoral performance that saw its tally nearly double from 2019, Sonia Gandhi said Modi is unlikely to change the substance and style of his governance, warning of ""challenging times ahead"".""We have to be alert to prevent any attempts to increase polarisation and erosion of secular and democratic values by the ruling cabal.

It is now up to us to build on it.""Taking jibes at Modi, Sonia said the PM sidelined the BJP and its allies to seek a mandate ""solely in his name"", but has suffered a political and moral defeat. ""In reality, he has lost the mandate and the right to leadership as well. Yet, far from taking responsibility for failure, he intends to get himself sworn in again tomorrow,"" she mocked.The possibility of Rahul taking over the LOP post increased in view of the CWC resolution.At the meeting, veteran Digvijaya Singh raised the demand for Rahul taking over the LOP, which was echoed by Gaurav Gogoi, Devendra Yadav, CMs Siddaramaiah, Revanth Reddy, among others. They said his leadership will boost the voice of the party members. Interestingly, according to sources, Kharge underlined that over 200 MPs will be standing behind him when he takes on the government.The perch will place Rahul at the head of the opposition bloc which has returned to the 18th Lok Sabha with a boosted tally after a decade, and the coming together of the anti-BJP parties under the INDIA bloc is likely to boost cohesion too.Kharge said Congress has posted a good performance, and increased its seats in SC/ST/OBC/minority dominated areas and in rural regions, but the party has to win in urban areas too. He pointedly noted that Congress has underperformed in the states where it had won assembly elections, in a reference to Karnataka, Himachal and Telangana.Thanking the INDIA allies for fighting well in different states, the CWC singled out Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra for special mention.At the same time, Kharge told party members that elections will be held in important states in coming months, a reference to Haryana and Maharashtra, and the party should defeat the rivals at any cost. ""People want a change, and we have to become their strength,"" he said.Congress members lamented the absence of a level playing field in the elections, or else the BJP would have got 100-150 seats fewer.

Challenges ahead for BJP-led NDA government with secular allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/challenges-ahead-for-bjp-led-nda-government-with-secular-allies/articleshow/110826236.cms,"NEW DELHI: The new BJP-led NDA government , dependent on its allies , since on its own the saffron party is short of 32 votes from the simple majority mark of 272 in a House of 543 Lok Sabha seats, will find it difficult to push for BJP’s hard Hindutva line, since its main support comes from secular parties like TDP and JD(U).Among the NDA partners, substantial support to BJP which finished with 240 seats, comes from N Chandrababu Naidu ’s TDP representing Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar ’s JDU representing Bihar.With that equation holding the Narendra Modi-led government, it will be difficult for BJP to push its hard Hindutva line, since Naidu and Kumar have both to cater to its minority voters in their respective states. Both seasoned, veteran leaders have been known for wooing minority voters and hence would have to take care to see minority citizens are not offended.Even before the swearing-in, TDP general secretary and Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh on Friday made a public statement saying his party is committed to the current 4% reservation for Muslims under the OBC list, as it is meant to expose the under-represented to opportunities.Naturally the previous Modi government’s policies of bringing CAA and NRC or approving UCC in some states and other such RSS-driven policies that hurts interests of minorities, are bound to hit a roadblock for now, if the government has to function.Even BJP’s hard Hindutva party line will have to be blurred, to create a comfort zone for the allies, who have become crucial for the survival of Modi’s third term at office.Kumar has been pushing for a national caste census, that RSS-BJP are uncomfortable with, hence it is to be seen whether it becomes a sticky point in the new coalition or the Modi government agrees to it.The minority population in Andhra Pradesh is 36.63 lakh (excluding Christians) as per the 2011 census of which Muslims 36.17 lakhs, Sikhs 0.10 lakhs, Buddhists 0.04 lakhs, Jains 0.27 lakhs and Parsis 0.04 lakhs. That Naidu will also head the state government in Andhra Pradesh, makes it more significant for him to be able to address the issues of the minorities.Bihar is home to almost 17% Muslims apart from other minorities and hence Kumar’s JD(U) has traditionally opposed anti-minorityism. In fact, for a long time before Kumar accepted working with Modi, even as there has been many flip-flops since, it was Modi’s anti-minority image during his chief ministership days in Gujarat, that created a political divide between the two leaders.While it is a matter of the past, it would not be easy for Kumar to accept hard-Hindutva agenda that was the mark of the last terms of Modi’s majority government.","N Chandrababu Naidu ’s TDP representing Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar’s JDU representing Bihar.
