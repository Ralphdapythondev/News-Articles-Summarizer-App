He added, ""Those who refused to acknowledge the struggles of Vinesh and her friends, and even raised questions about their intentions and abilities, have now received their answer.""He continued, ""Today, the entire system of power that made her shed tears of blood lies shattered before the brave daughter of India,"" emphasizing that champions prove their worth on the field.Phogat’s triumph has sparked reactions from the opposition, who criticized the government for ignoring her demands during her protests in January 2023.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh questioned whether the Prime Minister would congratulate Phogat and apologize for the mistreatment she endured at the hands of the Delhi Police during the women wrestlers' protest.Ramesh said, “Vinesh Phogat is assured of a silver or a gold medal at Paris. Will the non-biological PM call her? To congratulate her of course but more importantly to apologise for the atrocious manner in which the Delhi Police misbehaved with her during the women wrestlers protest?”Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the celebration, eagerly anticipating Phogat’s medal and expressing unwavering support. ""She reached the finals by winning three important matches in a single day. My sister, we are all eagerly waiting for the medal. Your every move on the field thrills us all. The prayers of crores of Indians are with you. Jai Hind! Keep fighting! Keep moving forward!"" she said.Phogat, along with wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, had protested for the removal and arrest of WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment.Phogat's remarkable performance in the women’s 50kg freestyle wrestling event has assured her of at least a silver medal, marking India’s best result at the Paris Olympics . Her path to glory was fraught with challenges, including standing up against the wrestling federation chief, enduring harsh conditions during a 40-day protest in New Delhi, confronting police adversity, and undergoing knee surgery.","Congress leaders lauded Vinesh Phogat ’s historic achievement at the Olympics.

I came to India on July 28 on a holiday, hoping to visit Kashmir with my husband, a police officer in Dhaka. But it remained a hope after a week-long peaceful protest against a quota system metamorphosed into unprecedented violence there.My husband was called back to duty, and he got stuck in Dhaka. I am worried about him and several of my relatives and friends in police which are bearing the brunt of the violence.Since Monday, I have been hearing about police stations falling prey to arsonists.Several cops have been killed since the fall of Sheikh Hasina govt. What’s their fault? Police officials were just following govt orders.I heard that Bangladesh Police Subordinate Employees’ Association has announced an indefinite strike to protest against attacks on police force. One can understand when cops call strike — it’s their last resort to save themselves.I want to go back to my husband and my relatives in the time of crisis, but I am stuck here. I had booked a ticket on an IndiGo flight at 2.50 pm on Tuesday but the flight was cancelled. Bangladesh Biman too has not been able to provide confirmed tickets. We have checked out of the hotel as I want to reach Dhaka as early as possible by any means. Now, I am desperately trying to get a bus ticket to Dhaka.The visuals coming from my country have unnerved me. I cannot stand vested interests hijacking a popularstudent movement . Students are our future. It’s disheartening to see them being misled and falling into the hands of vandals.The new govt needs to be tolerant and inclusive. We cannot destroy Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s statues. Also, PM’s residence is not a piece of private property; it has a historic significance. I wish the authorities establish peace first. Most Bangladeshis are peaceful and extremely hopeful of the future.

"Situation evolving, threat to minorities matter of concern, EAM tells House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-evolving-threat-to-minorities-matter-of-concern-eam-tells-house/articleshow/112329420.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the first public remarks on the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh, foreign minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday told Parliament that India has been in regular touch with authorities in Dhaka in the past 24 hours about the “evolving” and “complex” situation, as he also expressed deep concern over the threat to minorities and asserted that India expects the host govt to protect Indian establishments so that they can function normally once the situation improves.While giving nothing away on where deposed PM Sheikh Hasina might be headed, the minister said she had sought at a very short notice approval to come “for the moment” to India.Conscious of the delicate situation in Dhaka, Jaishankar in his suo moto statement avoided making any remark that might be misinterpreted as an attempt to dictate the terms of govt formation to Bangladesh. Significantly, while India had publicly said during the protests against Hasina that this was an internal issue of Bangladesh, Jaishankar disclosed the Indian govt had repeatedly advised restraint and urged “various political forces” it was in touch with that the situation be defused through dialogue. He didn’t name the Hasina govt or any party but said various decisions and actions after the stir refused to die down only exacerbated the situation.Unlike the US, which welcomed the formation of an interim govt, Jaishankar only took note of Army chief Waker-uz-Zaman talking about assuming responsibility and constituting a govt. Giving details of the violence that erupted on August 4 against the Hasina regime in the past few days, he said what was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this was still not clear, he said.“On August 5, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, PM Hasina apparently made the decision to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladeshi authorities,” Jaishankar said, adding the govt was in continuous touch with theIndian community in Bangladesh through its diplomatic missions and has asked border forces to be exceptionally alert because of the complex situation.He said there are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals in Bangladesh, of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of the students had already returned to India in July on the advice of the Indian high commission, he said. “In terms of our diplomatic presence, in addition to the high commission in Dhaka, we have assistant high commissions in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet. It is our expectation that the host govt will provide the required security protection for these establishments. We look forward to their normal functioning once the situation stabilises,” he said, adding India-Bangladesh relations have been exceptionally close for many decades.Jaishankar said India was closely following the situation with regard to the minorities and appreciates initiatives by various groups to protect them but added it would remain deeply concerned till law and order was visibly restored.India, along with Russia and China, had endorsed the elections early this year in which Hasina had secured another term in office in the absence of any real opposition. Jaishankar said since the election, there had been considerable tensions, deep divides and growing polarisation in Bangladesh politics. This underlying foundation, he said, aggravated a student agitation that started in June, leading to increasing violence. India has so far not officially blamed forces aligned with Pakistan for the situation but it’s widely believed opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami worked to transform the students’ agitation into a movement for regime change.",India has been in regular touch with authorities in Dhaka in the past 24 hours about the ‘evolving’ and ‘complex’ situation.

"SC bristles, mulls action as Punjab & Haryana HC judge slams apex court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bristles-mulls-action-as-punjab-haryana-hc-judge-slams-apex-court/articleshow/112329157.cms,"SC direction is to make HCs servile to apex court: Justice Sherawat

NEW DELHI: Taking serious note of “judicial indiscipline” of Punjab and Haryana high court judge Rajbir Sherawat by showing defiance towards a Supreme Court order, CJI D Y Chandrachud and four most senior judges decided to form a bench on Wednesday to decide the future course of action in regard to the HC judge’s July 17 order.Justice Sherawat had remarked in his order: “A tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more ‘Supreme’ than it actually is and to presume a high court to be less ‘High’ than it constitutionally is.”The bench of CJI Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy will tackle Justice Sherawat’s order, who had reluctantly adjourned a contempt proceeding initiated by him because of SC’s stay.Justice Sherawat had said, “But this (adjourning a case because of SC order) may not be always possible for an HC to follow such a course in view of particular facts and circumstances embedded in a particular case or because of involvement of some statutory provisions. That would be an unfortunate situation, which would better be avoided.”Justice Sherawat had gone on to propagate that contempt proceedings initiated by a single-judge HC bench had to be appealed before the division bench of HC and that the role of SC would arise only when the contemnor, whose conviction is upheld by the division bench, files an appeal in the apex court. It is an elementary fact that SC has overarching jurisdiction over any matter before any court, including HCs, and on any subject whether pending in any court or not.Justice Sherawat said, “SC may have power to permit a special appeal by a ‘party’ to contempt proceedings before HC , against certain types of orders of contempt court under certain circumstances, however, in the present case neither there are any such circumstances, nor has any such special appeal been filed by the respondents against any such order of the contempt court. Hence, in the given circumstances, the order of SC turns out to be simply in the nature of putting an estoppel on the powers of HC exercisable under Article 215 of the Constitution of India and under the Contempt of Courts Act.”“However, it is highly doubtful if the apex court has any such power to stay operation of Article 215 of the Constitution of India and the Contempt of Courts Act, per se. Probably more caution on the part of SC would have been more appropriate,” the judge said while lecturing SC on judicial propriety .Justice Sherawat faulted SC for attempting to control the roster of HC and issuing guidelines for designation of senior advocates and said this direction is to make HCs servile to SC. He said SC did not fathom the damage it has caused by staying the contempt proceedings initiated by him. Defending initiation of contempt proceedings relating to non-filling up of judicial officers’ post, the HC judge asked, “Who is responsible for this plight of judicial officers manning the superior judiciary of state of Punjab and state of Haryana. Is it HC or is it SC ?”Punching way beyond his judicial weight, Justice Sherawat said in his humble opinion HC “should sound a note of caution even for SC to be more specific in causing legal consequences through its order”.",Punjab and Haryana high court judge Rajbir Sherawat showed defiance towards a Supreme Court order.

NEW DELHI: The Grambusch brothers, Mats and Tom, were writing Germany's comeback scripts for fun at the World Cup last year. It had a happy ending as well. The Germans lifted the trophy in a final that can only be described as 'madness refusing to end'. The penalty shootout went to sudden death and required 14 attempts to give the World Cup its winner and dethrone Belgium.The point of reference is obvious for those having their eyes on Paris. India are playing Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics.A place in the final, confirmation of a medal -- the stakes are pretty high, even higher for India, who haven't played an Olympic hockey final for 44 years and have not won successive hockey medals at the Games for 52 years. And PR Sreejesh will hope that he finishes his career with a medal in the biggest game of his iconic career, an Olympic final.For each of the above to happen, India will have to beat Germany.A little part of the narrative for the Germans is also revenge. The wounds of that epic bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Olympics are fresh at three years old. The Germans sank into the turf after ending on the wrong side of 5-4 final score, while the Indians celebrated a long-awaited return to the Games' podium after 41 years.The storyline of Tuesday's semifinal has enough sub-plots to make any player nervous. But this Indian team has played like one that doesn't carry butterflies requiring Dr. Rajendra Kalra's psychological tricks to settle.Forty-nine years ago, Dr Kalra, a physician settled in Chandigarh, was named as the official doctor of the Indian team travelling to Kuala Lumpur for the 1975 World Cup.Before the final against Pakistan, a couple of players complained to him about a stomach ailment. Reading the players' minds and it coinciding with the enormity of the occasion, Dr Kalra played a psychologist instead of a physician.He asked the organisers for some jaggery and black sesame seeds. Once it was delivered to him, he melted the jaggery, added the sesame seeds to it and rolled the mixture into tiny balls resembling medicine pills.Dr Kalra asked the jittery players to take that before stepping onto the field.It worked. India won the World Cup. But not because of Dr Kalra's pseudo pills, but because of 11 confident players on the field.Back to Paris, this Indian team has come of age.If the win over Australia in the Olympics after 52 years was like claiming lost territory, coach Craig Fulton's men turned its defence into fortresss in the quarterfinal. Playing with 10 men for over 40 minutes after Amit Rohidas was shown the red card, India put adversity to shame by not just holding Great Britain to 1-1 in 60 minutes, but also by stamping its authority in the shootout. India scored all four, Sreejesh saved two. A 4-2 (1-1) win took India to a second consecutive Olympic semifinal.But that Rohidas red card, for flaying his stick in anger across the face of England striker Will Calnan, came back to haunt the Tokyo bronze medallists.The defender, most importantly India's first rusher on penalty-corner defence, was handed a one-match suspension and will sit out of the semifinal on Tuesday.If there is one thing that can make India nervous before running into the Germans, it's Rohidas's unavailability, which hampers rolling substitutions, short-corner defence and a reduced drag-flick backup for skipper Harmanpreet Singh.Where it can also hurt India is in manufacturing counter-attacks after a successful defence of a penalty corner, because one of the midfielders might have to be pulled back to complete the set of five in India's post with Rohidas out on the suspension chair.Perhaps one way to look beyond that disadvantage is that it remains 11 vs 11 on the battlefield. The dugout can take care of the 15 vs 16.The massive occasion reminds of the comment once made by former India coach Michael Nobbs.""You need to put coffins on the sidelines and give it your all when playing for your country,"" the Australian once said.You can't doubt this Indian team about giving it their all. If they can do it for 120 more minutes across two days in the French capital, the 'Holy Grail' will be back to where it belonged for eight Olympic editions, six of those in a row.All roads for the Indians on Tuesday in Paris will lead to the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, while millions back home cross their fingers.",India play Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics.

NEW DELHI: As Bangladesh faced political upheaval, India had to act swiftly to ensure the safety of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as she left her country. Security agencies prepared for all eventualities as Hasina headed towards India in an Air Force jet.Around 3pm, Indian Air Force radars detected a low-flying aircraft approaching the Indian border from Bangladesh.Air defense personnel, aware of the high-profile passenger onboard, allowed the aircraft to enter Indian airspace. To provide security, two Rafale fighter jets from the 101 squadron at Hashimara air base in West Bengal were deployed over Bihar and Jharkhand, according to ANI.The aircraft followed its designated flight path, closely monitored by ground agencies, with constant communication between the plane and top Indian security officials. Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and General Upendra Dwivedi, the chiefs of the Indian Air Force and Army, respectively, closely monitored the situation.A high-level meeting was held with intelligence agency chiefs, General Dwivedi, and Lieutenant General Johnson Philip Mathew, the Integrated Defence Staff chief.As Hasina's jet landed at Hindan air base around 5:45pm, she was greeted by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. They held an hour-long meeting, discussing the current situation in Bangladesh and her future plans. Doval then briefed the Cabinet Committee of Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been kept informed throughout the day.Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country. Her resignation came after a violent crackdown on protests that had grown from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-fledged movement demanding her ouster.As news of Hasina's exit spread, volatile crowds took to the streets, with some vandalizing the statue of her father and Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.In an address to the nation, army chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman announced that an interim government would be formed and that he had met with members of most political parties, taking full responsibility for the country.Also Visit: Bangladesh Protests Live Updates","Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge. Initially ruled lbw by the on-field umpire, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge technology indicated a spike near the bat, leading TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the decision. Kohli's relief was evident as he smiled following the reversed call.The decision did not sit well with the Sri Lankan players. Kusal Mendis expressed his frustration by throwing his helmet to the ground, and Asalanka conveyed his displeasure to the on-field umpire, Raveendra Wimalasiri. Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya also came down from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire.Despite the reprieve, Kohli's innings was short-lived. Four overs later, Vandersay bowled Kohli with a flipper that trapped him in front of the middle stump. Although Kohli considered another review, his partner Axar Patel dissuaded him, resulting in Kohli's departure.As Kohli approached the Sri Lankan unit for the customary post-match handshake, Jayasuriya stopped him for an intense but brief chat.

PARIS: The world stopped, as did the 80,000 at the Stade de France . Even Noah Lyles and Kishane Thompson - fighting for the crown of the fastest man on the earth - didn’t know. The race had lasted less than 10 seconds, and those minutes of wait that followed felt like an eternity. Till the scoreboard flashed - Noah Lyles.Trailing through the race from start to finish and only leading at the finish line, the man from the United States was the king of 100m.He had edged Jamaican Thompson by five thousandths of a second in a race where eight of the participants ran sub-10. Even world champion and Tokyo silver medallist Fred Kerley, who took the bronze in 9.81s, was barely 0.01s ahead of Akani Simbine, who finished fourth.From the moment Noah arrived at the scene, he looked to be the showstealer. Jumping around and getting the fans on his side, the man from USA tried to tell the world that this stage belongs to him. But those around him were champions in their own right, they were not ready to give an inch.And over the next 10 second blitz, which produced the greatest 100m dash of all time, the first and eighth were separated by 0.12s, the smallest ever gap in an Olympics or Worlds final. Thompson’s foot reached the finish line before Lyles, but the 27-year-old had put his torso forward, which had pipped the Jamaican to the post.""I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, I think you got that one.' But then my name popped up, and I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm amazing',"" Lyles said, when asked what he told Thompson after the photo finish .The sprinter said the moment ""was a lot to deal with"".""I had so many commercials going around and so many people saying that I'm going to be the one. I'm not going to say it's not pressure. Saying that the moment is not bigger than me, that moment was meant for me.""Earlier in the semis, the American star came second to Oblique Seville, who clocked 9.81s, 0.02 ahead of Lyles. ""To be honest, if I'm running 9.83 in the semifinals I'm going to be hard to beat. I called my therapist, and she told me to let go, to let it flow... And I was like, 'Alright I'm going to trust you'.""Lyles also thanked the crowd. ""Oh my god that crowd was amazing. I couldn't have a better crowd.""

‘She’s in shock, we will wait till she settles’

India seeks normalcy for its missions after law restored

NEW DELHI/LONDON: After reports that deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was headed West, or London in all likelihood, it emerged Tuesday that she might have to stay put in India for days, if not longer. With India tight-lipped about how long it can allow her to stay here and the UK effectively ruling out asylum for her, Hasina was said to be exploring other options, including the US and Finland .While London is Hasina’s first choice for asylum, she hasn’t officially approached authorities yet, as confirmed by her son Sajeeb Wazed. Wazed was quoted as saying the US and the UK, where she has extended family, would be possible choices.Foreign minister S Jaishankar made it clear in Parliament that Hasina had sought approval to come to India only “for the moment”. India remains apprehensive about her opponents in Dhaka, with whom it needs to work now, using her extended stay to sow doubts about India’s intentions.Despite the setback caused by Hasina’s exit, India has said it wants its missions in Bangladesh to function normally once law and order is restored.Foreign minister S Jaishankar told an all-party meeting Tuesday that ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina was in shock at the turn of events and the govt would discuss with her about her future course once she is settled down. Hasina, who landed in Hindon in a BAF aircraft with her sister on Monday, has been moved to a safehouse.Despite the setback caused by Sheikh Hasina’s exit, India has said it wants its missions in Bangladesh to function normally once law and order is restored.The UK Home Office would not officially comment on the asylum claim as such claims are confidential but Home Office sources told TOI, “It is not possible to apply for asylum from outside UK. The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision within our immigration rules for someone to be allowed to travel to UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge. Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, that is the fastest route to safety.”Strongly hinting Hasina should apply for asylum in India, the source added, “Each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits on a case-by-case basis.”Hasina, 76, arrived at Hindon air base in Ghaziabad on Monday with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana (68) in a C-130 military plane and shifted to Delhi.Rehana already has political asylum in the UK and holds British citizenship. She took refuge in the UK after the assassination of her father, Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975. The sisters had planned to move swiftly to London but will now have to rethink their next destination.Hasina’s niece Tulip Siddiq, who is Rehana’s daughter, is a Labour MP and is economic secretary to the Treasury in the new Labour govt.On Monday, UK foreign secretary David Lammy said, “The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks.” He also said the UK wants to see action taken to ensure a peaceful and democratic future for Bangladesh.Bangladeshis made up the fifth largest nationality of main applications seeking asylum in the United Kingdom in 2023 numbering 4,300.The UK can also grant other forms of humanitarian protection to people who the Home Office decides need protection but who do not meet the criteria for refugee status. Hasina could apply for discretionary leave outside the immigration rules. Or she could go to the UK on a visa but it would be illegal to later apply for asylum unless she could prove a change in circumstances.","Sheikh Hasina is said to be exploring other options, including the US and Finland.

Chishty alleged that waqf boards work in a “dictatorial” manner and cited dargahs as one the biggest “victims” of mismanagement & corruption eating into the waqf system.Citing that sufi traditions are not recognised under the current law, Chishty who is AISSC chairman has raised demand for a separate dargah board under the law.Representatives of prominent dargahs including Delhi’s Nizamuddin Auliya and Agra’s Fatehpur Sikri and representatives of sufi shrines from Rajasthan, Hyderabad and Karnataka were present at a press conference in Delhi.They highlighted that smaller dargahs are often slapped with notices resulting in endless legal battles. Chishty shared that there are about 2,000 dargahs including small ones across country and around 800 prominent ones are associated with the council.AISSC representatives, met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday. Chishty said they were assured that “all stakeholders will be consulted and amendments will be in the interest of Muslims.”On Tuesday, Rijiju in a post on X described the interaction with AISSC representatives as a “fruitful and forward looking discussion” and highlighted that they praised the efforts of PM Narendra Modi-led govt towards welfare of minorities.To questions about AIMPLB and other Muslim organisations opposing proposal for amendments and citing it to be an attack on rights of Muslims, Chishty asked those opposing how they had made up their mind without even seeing the Bill. He cautioned theMuslim community to not fall prey and warned against “false propaganda” and attempting “to divide society based on religion.”Chishty, however, underlined the need for wider consultations on the Bill with stakeholders. “In the present Waqf Act, there is no mention of dargahs at all. Waqf Boards do not recognise traditions of the dargah as many of our traditions are not there in sharia, so we demand a separate Dargah Board,” he said.In their memorandum to Doval and Rijiju, Chishty said, “Our council and various organisations have consistently submitted memorandums over the past decades, urging amendments to the law. “Following a thorough examination of the draft Bill, we intend to submit our recommendations and proposal.

GUWAHATI: Amid protests by Manipur ’s Kukis against the withdrawal of two “non-partisan” Assam Rifles (AR) battalions from two sensitive security buffer zones in the strife-torn state, Army has recommended placing the incoming CRPF battalions under the command and control of AR’s sector headquarters.Kuki MLAs have been part of the protests to retain the AR troops.The community fears the move to withdraw a “non-partisan force like Assam Rifles” could lead to a resurgence of violence.Army has directed relocation of the two AR battalions from Manipur to Nagaland , where they will relieve two other battalions. These relieved battalions will be redeployed in J&K. Assam Rifles, despite being a paramilitary force, has a dual control structure, with the Army overseeing operational control and home ministry handling administrative supervision.Currently, the two Assam Rifles battalions are deployed in Manipur’s Kangvai along the Churachandpur-Bishnupur border, and Kangchup on the Kangpokpi-Imphal (East) inter-district borders.The incoming CRPF battalions, comprising over 2,000 personnel, are being transferred from J&K and Telangana and are expected to assume their new positions this month, a security source said. The AR battalions are expected to hand over their areas of responsibility within one week of the CRPF battalions’ arrival, the source added.“It has been recommended that the command and control of the two CRPF battalions, relieving the AR battalions, is vested with the respective AR sector headquarters of IG (E) and IG (S), to ensure cohesion in operations in these sensitive areas,” the source said. Besides, the two CRPF battalions will undergo three months of on-the-job training “in view of the prevailing security situation in the state”.Additionally, like other infantry battalions inducted into Manipur, they will undergo four weeks of pre-induction training at the Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Vairengte, Mizoram, suggesting their involvement in counter-insurgency operations in the state.","Two Assam Rifles battalions are deployed in Manipur’s Kangvai along the Churachandpur-Bishnupur border, and Kangchup on the Kangpokpi-Imphal (East) inter-district borders.

He accused Congress of engaging in the “politics of lies” and claimed that their actions demonstrate a disgusting mentality.Pradhan asserted that Congress has consistently opposed India’s development and education system, and urged those who criticise Indian education system to seek the truth before spreading misinformation.NCERT has made changes to its curriculum for current academic year, removing the Preamble to the Constitution from some Class 3 & 6 textbooks across subjects. The Preamble, which previously served as an introduction to core values of the Constitution, has been excluded from textbooks for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and “World Around Us” in Class 3, as well as from new English textbook and Sanskrit textbook in Class 6. However, the Preamble remains in Hindi textbook and science textbook.Ranjana Arora, head of the department of curriculum studies and development at NCERT, clarified that the allegation was untrue.

For the first time, under National Education Policy, NCERT has given due importance and respect to various aspects of the Constitution, Preamble, fundamental duties, fundamental rights, national anthem , in textbooks.”Pradhan argued that Congress’s understanding of the Constitution is exposed by their belief that only the Preamble reflects constitutional values.

Can trial courts order fixed-term life imprisonment? SC to decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-trial-courts-order-fixed-term-life-imprisonment-sc-to-decide/articleshow/112328022.cms,"NEW DLEHI: After reducing instances of death penalty to a rarity through interpretative development of criminal jurisprudence , SC Tuesday proposed to examine trial courts ’ power to impose fixed-term life imprisonments to convicts in heinous crimes and whether this should be the exclusive jurisdiction of Constitution courts , SC and high courts.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and R Mahadevan dismissed an appeal by a life convict from Chhattisgarh but expressed surprise that the trial court had given a 20 year-sentence.The bench opined that it was for Constitution courts, SC and HCs, to do so.Under the Criminal Procedure Code, now replaced by Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, a lifer can make an application to the state govt concerned for remission of the remaining part of life sentence after he/she has served 14 years. The state is empowered to remit the sentence if it finds the convict had exhibited good conduct during the imprisonment period and could be re-assimilated in the society.Interestingly, in Feb, a bench comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and Prashant Kumar Mishra entertained a petition filed by Chandrakant Jha, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders and given the death penalty for another. The petition challenged the power of Constitution courts to award such sentences, specifically questioning Delhi HC’s decision to award him imprisonment for the rest of his life while commuting his capital punishment.Jha’s counsel Rishi Malhotra had argued that Constitution courts cannot take away the statutory rights of a convict to seek remission after serving 14 years jail term. Jha was awarded death penalty by trial court in 2013 for murdering a 19-year-old in 2007 and dumping his headless body near Tihar jail.Last year a bench of Justices A S Oka and Sanjay Kumar in Ravinder Singh vs Govt of NCT of Delhi, had said, “With regard to special category sentencing to life imprisonment beyond 14 years by fixing a lengthier term would be available to HCs and SC, even in cases where the maximum punishment permissible in law is duly imposed.”However, the bench had clarified that such sentencing must be restricted to grave cases “where allowing the convict sentenced to life imprisonment to seek release after 14 years of imprisonment will be tantamount to trivialising the very punishment imposed on such convicts.”But in judgments through decades — Gopal Vinayak Godse (1961), Mar Ram (1981) and V Sriharan @ Murugan (2016) — Constitution benches of SC have consistently ruled that life sentence is nothing less than life long imprisonment and would last till the last breath of the convict.","A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and R Mahadevan dismissed an appeal by a life convict from Chhattisgarh.

Between April and December 2013, Dave returned Rs. 3.29 crore of the Rs. 3.50 crore invested by the Dhawans in the project.

The Ghatkopar police have booked four partners of a realty firm , Punjalal G Dave Realtors LLP, after a 63-year-old Ghatkopar resident lodged a complaint of cheating . The resident alleged that the developer induced him to invest in a redevelopment project in 2011, failed to return his investment and profit, and cheated him of Rs. 3.91 crore. Maulik Dave, one of the directors of Dave Realtors, has refuted all the allegations levelled in the FIR and said that instead, the complainant, Sanjay Dhawan, has to pay them a huge amount.Dhawan, in the FIR, has alleged that his late father, Janakraj, was close friends with Harshadbhai Dave, the former owner of the firm, and Janakraj had invested Rs. 5.5 crore in the company.In 2005, Kalpesh Seth, a director at Seth Builders and a committee member of Jai Arihant Housing Society, Ghatkopar, approached Janakraj with a proposal to invest in the society's redevelopment. Between 2008 and 2010, they paid Seth a total of Rs. 82.63 lakh. However, the project was stalled in 2011, and the power of attorney was transferred to Sanjay. The society later decided to transfer the incomplete project to Punjalal Dave’s firm, and Dhawan provided a no-objection certificate for the same, states the FIR.However, Dhawan, in his complaint, alleged that the Daves later convinced him to invest further in two projects—Chandani CHS in Ghatkopar and Arihant Siddhi Apartment in Borivali, promising him 25% of the saleable area. From 2013 to 2015, Dhawan allegedly paid Rs. 3.91 crore via cheque, but these funds were never deposited in Aspria Constructions but in their personal accounts. Dhawan alleged that when he asked for his investment, the Dave group refused to entertain him. Dhawan claimed that despite repeated requests and warnings, the money was not refunded, and his family received threats instead.Speaking to TOI, Maulik Dave said, ""The entire FIR is bogus.

"Allegations of removing preamble from textbooks is baseless: Prof Ranjana Arora, NCERT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/allegations-of-removing-preamble-from-textbooks-is-baseless-prof-ranjana-arora-ncert/articleshow/112315516.cms,"NCERT’s response on the issue

What changes have been made to NCERT textbooks?

For textbooks of class 3:

For textbooks of class 6:

NEW DELHI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT ) has made notable adjustments to its curriculum for the current academic year by removing the Preamble to the Indian Constitution from several Class 3 and Class 6 textbooks . This change affects textbooks in subjects such as languages and environmental studies.For Class 3, the Preamble has been excluded from textbooks for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and ""World Around Us,"" which replaces the former Environmental Studies (EVS) subject.Previously, the Preamble was featured in the introductory pages of these books, serving as an initial exposure to the core values of the Indian Constitution.In Class 6, the Preamble is no longer present in the new English textbook ""Poorvi"" and the Sanskrit textbook ""Deepakam."" The environmental studies content has been reduced from three textbooks to one. However, the Preamble remains in the Hindi textbook ""Malhar"" and the science textbook ""Curiosity.""In response to concerns about these changes, NCERT stated in an official tweet that their educational materials aim to provide a thorough understanding of constitutional values. Professor Ranjana Arora, Head of the Department of Curriculum Studies and Development at NCERT, stated in the official statement, ""The notion that only the Preamble reflects constitutional values is false. We intend to impart these values in a variety of ways, in line with theNEP-2020 's vision for holistic child development.NCERT has responded to the controversy surrounding the removal of the Preamble from textbooks, claiming that the claims lack substance. NCERT tweeted, ""For the first time, NCERT is emphasising various aspects of the Indian Constitution, including the Preamble, Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights, and the National Anthem, across different textbooks and stages."" The assumption that only the Preamble expresses constitutional values is flawed. Children can also learn these values from Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights, and the National Anthem, all of which are equally important for holistic development under NEP-2020.Check the official statement below-The Preamble has been removed from all new textbooks, including those for Hindi, English, Mathematics, and ""World Around Us."" Previously, it was included in the old EVS book ""Looking Around"" and the Hindi book ""Rimjhim 3.""In the updated textbooks aligned with the NEP-2020, the Preamble remains in the Science book ""Curiosity"" and the Hindi book ""Malhar."" It has been omitted from the Social Science book ""Exploring Society: India and Beyond,"" which instead covers fundamental rights and duties. The previous editions included the Preamble in the English book ""Honey Suckle,"" the Science book, the Hindi book ""Durva,"" and all three Social Science books.The new English textbook ""Poorvi"" includes the National Anthem, while the Sanskrit textbook ""Deepakam"" features both the National Anthem and the National Song, but not the Preamble. The earlier Sanskrit book ""Ruchira"" also did not include the Preamble.","National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT) has made notable adjustments to its curriculum.
