Former Union Minister Anurag Thakur brought Parliamentary discourse to a new low by asking a fellow MP and the leader of opposition about his caste identity,"" Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Ramesh further pointed out that despite the Chair Jagadambika Pal assuring MPs that the comments would be expunged, Sansad TV uploaded the unedited speech, and the Prime Minister publicly shared and praised it. He called this a ""new and shameful low in the annals of India's parliamentary history"" and said it reflects the ""BJP-RSS and Mr. Modi's deep-rooted casteism.""Thakur's remark that ""those whose caste is not known"" are talking about caste census caused an uproar in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, with Congress MPs protesting in the well.PM Modi shared Thakur's speech, calling it a ""must hear"" and describing it as ""a perfect mix of facts and humour, exposing the dirty politics of the INDI Alliance.""Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also criticized Thakur's comments. Yadav questioned the appropriateness of asking someone's caste, while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra pointed out that a socio-economic caste census is demanded by 80% of the country's population. She asked if 80% of India's population would now be abused in Parliament and called on PM Modi to clarify if this happened at his behest.Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said that the words used by Thakur for Rahul Gandhi have angered people and are echoing in their minds.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused the Prime Minister of promoting a ""serious breach of Parliamentary privilege"" PM Modi shared Thakur's speech, calling it a ""must hear"" and describing it as ""a perfect mix of facts and humour, exposing the dirty politics of the INDI Alliance""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112153155,imgsize-1136936,width-400,resizemode-4/112153155.jpg"

Beirut airport cancels flights amid fears of Israeli attack; airlines cite 'insurance risks'

NEW DELHI: There is conspiracy to break this society into compartments behind asking questions about how many SC/ST or OBC officials are part of the halwa ceremony and the making of the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in Lok Sabha on Tuesday during her reply on the 2024 Budget.Sitharaman was reacting to comments made by the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha on Monday.As Rahul cited Mahabharata's 'chakravyuha' (trap) to attack the Modi government 3.0, he pulled out a photo of 'halwa ceremony' which was held at the ministry of finance before the presentation of Union budget as per tradition.""This photo shows budget ka halwa being distributed in this photo. I can't see one OBC or tribal or a Dalit officer in this. 20 officers prepared the budget ... Hindustan ka halwa 20 logon ne baatne ka kaam kiya hai..."" he said.The remark led Sitharaman, who was also in the House, to cover her face with a smile.Contending that previous Congress governments and leaders such as former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru or Rajiv Gandhi were strongly against reservations, the finance minister on Tuesday attacked the opposition for raising questions over who was involved in the halwa ceremony.She also asked how many SC/ST or OBC trustees are there in the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation or the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust.On Tuesday, Sitharaman also went into detail about the significance of the halwa ceremony.It marks the beginning of the Budget printing process and is seen as a gesture of appreciation for the officials and staff involved in the arduous task of compiling the budget documents, said the minister.After the ceremony, the officials and staff involved in the budget-making process are confined to their offices until the budget is presented in Parliament. This seclusion is intended to maintain confidentiality and prevent any leaks or premature disclosures of budgetary proposals, she added.The preparation and sharing of sweets like halwa hold cultural significance in many Indian ceremonies and festivals. By incorporating this ritual into the budget-making process, the ceremony bridges the gap between tradition and modern governance practices, said the minister.",Sitharaman was reacting to comments made by the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha on Monday.

So, what is the connection?

Congress,

CPM

vie for credit for Adani-linked project

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his ""Double A and A1,A2"" jibes at the BJP-led NDA government as she reminded the Congress leader about the recent milestone reached at Vizhinjam International Seaport in Kerala which welcomed its first mothership, 'San Fernando'.Rahul, who has often attacked the Narendra Modi government for favouring businessmen Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, had referred to the two as ""Double A"" and ""A1"" and ""A2"" during his recent speeches in Lok Sabha after Speaker Om Birla objected to naming individuals in Parliament who are not members of the House.Sitharaman today took digs at Rahul over his remarks and said: ""India's first trans-shipment port, all of us happily celebrated when a very big vessel reached Vizhinjam port. Kerala government, Congress government gave it, and nobody, who were speaking about double As and A1 and A2, questioned the Kerala government when Vizhinjam port was given on invitation to one of these investors.""It was the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government of Oommen Chandy that had in 2015 inked a deal with Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited for the mega project.The project was allotted to APSEZ on December 5, 2015, after the Government of Kerala and Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd. (AVPPL) agreed to a concession agreement on August 17, 2015.The state government of Kerala has contributed about Rs 5,595 crore while the central government contributed Rs 818 crore for the port. Built on the public-private partnership, Vizhinjam International Port's construction started in 2016.After the arrival of first mother ship earlier this month, Kerala Congress president K Sudhakaran claimed credit on behalf of grand old party and said the port became reality only because of the “willpower” of Oommen Chandy who died in July 2023. “Vijayan should apologise to the people of Kerala. CPM tried to kill the project. It is ludicrous to see that he is trying to take credit for the port. There is a bid to cover up the role of Chandy in making the port a reality,” Sudhakaran said.The ruling CPM in Kerala, which was then in the opposition, had kept away from the inauguration of the port’s construction alleging that the port project was a “dubious deal”. In the run-up to the 2016 assembly elections, the CPM dubbed the Vizhinjam project “looting of the sea by the Adani group”.Nine years down the line, Vijayan, now the Kerala chief minister, took a U-turn and said “We have to realise that Kerala opens a new chapter in its history of development. It is a moment of pride for Kerala.Vijayan even appreciated Adani Group and said, ""Adani Group, the builders and operators of the port, deserve appreciation for their efforts in ensuring the completion of this project. Vizhinjam Port exemplifies a successful public-private partnership, highlighting the potential of collaborative development. Join us in celebrating this historic achievement that marks a new era of progress and prosperity for Kerala.""Clearly, Sitharaman was targeting this contradiction of stand within the opposition camp, especially vis-à-vis Rahul Gandhi who misses no opportunity to target the government for favouring the two businessmen, even as his party engages with them at the state level.","Nirmala Sitharaman took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his ""Double A and A1,A2"" jibes at the NDA government.

Quad Meeting in Tokyo: Quad Condemns China's South China Sea Tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-raps-china-for-scs-manoeuvres-backs-philippines/articleshow/112117977.cms,"China expectedly loomed over the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo Monday as India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s “dangerous manoeuvres” in the South China Sea ( SCS ) and called for an Indo-Pacific in which no country dominates and no country is dominated.In a first, India also joined others in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone and.India had for the first time last year, in a joint statement with the Philippines, unambiguously asked China to adhere to the legally binding tribunal award Beijing has always called null and void. Before that India had restricted itself to only calling for respecting the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal was instituted.As they reassembled in Tokyo after the recent China-Philippines tensions, the ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and for this purpose, to enhance collaboration with regional partners. They also announced initiatives to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training and capacity building. “In line with such efforts, we intend to geographically expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to the Indian Ocean region,” said the joint statement.The ministers also committed to soon having the 2024 Quad summit which PM Narendra Modi is now looking to host on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September, pending the availability of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. Japan is yet to confirm because the date for ruling LDP election might clash with the General Assembly session, making it difficult for him to travel abroad.In his opening remarks, while talking about the need for Quad to uphold a rules-based order, Jaishankar said it’s only Quad collaboration that can ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free, remains open, stable, secure and prosperous.“It is therefore essential that our political understanding strengthens, our economic partnerships grow, our technology collaborations expand and our people-to-people comfort intensifies. Our meeting should send a clear message, that the Quad is here to stay, here to do and here to go,” he addedIn their pushback against China, the Quad ministers backed sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also expressing commitment to address debt crises through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. They expressed serious concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas, reiterating their strong opposition to any unilateral action to change the status quo by force or coercion.“We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea. We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” said the joint statement.According to the ministers, Quad is also looking to contribute to the region through capacity building cooperation for enhancing maritime security. “We intend to launch a Quad Maritime Legal Dialogue under the Quad Maritime Security Working Group to focus our expertise on international law of the sea issues in support of our efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific,” said the statement.","India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s ‘dangerous manoeuvres’ in the South China Sea ( SCS ) The ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112117994,imgsize-1556167,width-400,resizemode-4/112117994.jpg"

What was behind the Wayanad landslide?

Recurring disasters in Kerala

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The devastating landslides that struck the hilly regions near Meppadi in Kerala 's Wayanad district have claimed over 100 lives, while leaving over 128 others injured. The rescue efforts are ongoing, and the death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the affected areas.According to official sources, 3,069 people have been relocated to 45 relief camps in Wayanad alone.Five ministers have been assigned to coordinate the relief and rescue operations , ensuring that the affected individuals receive the necessary support and assistance during this challenging time.In response to the incident, the Kerala government has declared a two-day state mourning. An official notification, issued by chief secretary V Venu, has announced the observance of official mourning on July 30 and 31. As a mark of respect, the National Flag will be flown at half-mast, and all public functions and celebrations will be cancelled during this period.Over 250 people have been moved to a safer location, and 300 personnel have been deployed for rescue operations in the wake of a tragic landslide in the Wayanad district of Kerala.While addressing the Rajya Sabha, Nityanand Rai, the minister of home affairs, said, ""Today morning, the Wayanad district of Kerala witnessed a tragic incident of a landslide... two people have been rescued from the debries and around 250 people have been evacuted to safer locations.""The rescue efforts involve two teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), two columns of the Indian Army, and two Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, with a total of 300 personnel working together.Kerala chief minister assured that the state government has made arrangements for the best possible treatment for those who were injured in the incident. However, many people remain trapped under the debris while the rescue operations are ongoing.Providing details about the relief operations, CM added, ""321 members of the Fire Force have been deployed in Wayanad. The services of the Army have also been made available. An NDRF team of 60 members has reached Wayanad, and an 89-member team from Bengaluru is on the way"".The Wayanad landslide was triggered by extremely heavy rainfall caused by the warming of the Arabian Sea, according to climate experts.S Abhilash, the director of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), explained that the active monsoon offshore trough has been affecting the entire Konkan region for the last two weeks, leading to saturated soil in Kasargod, Kannur, Wayanad, Calicut, and Malappuram districts.On Monday, a deep mesoscale cloud system formed off the coast in the Arabian Sea, resulting in extremely heavy rain in Wayanad, Calicut, Malappuram, and Kannur. ""The clouds were very deep, similar to those seen during the 2019 Kerala floods,"" Abhilash said.Scientists have observed a trend of very deep cloud systems developing over the southeast Arabian Sea, which sometimes intrude into the land, as seen in 2019.The southeast Arabian Sea is becoming warmer, causing atmospheric instability above this region, including Kerala. With climate change , the rain-bearing belt with deep clouds is extending southward, which is the main reason behind such extremely heavy rainfall.In August 2018, Kerala experienced a devastating flood that claimed the lives of 483 people and was considered the state's worst flood in a century. The catastrophe not only resulted in the loss of lives but also caused extensive damage to property and livelihoods, prompting the central government to declare it a ""calamity of severe nature"".As Kerala was recovering from the 2018 floods, another tragedy struck in 2019 when a landslide in Puthumala, Wayanad, approximately 10 km from the currently affected areas, claimed 17 lives. In October 2021, heavy rainfall triggered landslides in Idukki and Kottayam districts, resulting in the death of 35 people. According to data provided by the IMD, heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents in 2021 led to the loss of 53 lives in Kerala.Exactly a year later, in August 2022, landslides and flash floods caused by heavy rains claimed 18 lives, damaged hundreds of properties, and forced thousands of people to seek shelter in relief camps, as reported by the state government.During the 2022 rain-related incidents, over 5,000 individuals were evacuated from disaster-hit and disaster-prone regions of the state and accommodated in 178 relief camps.The ministry of earth sciences has reported that Kerala has experienced the highest number of landslides in the country, with 2,239 out of 3,782 landslides occurring in the state between 2015 and 2022.","Death toll expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the affected areas. 3,069 people have been relocated to 45 relief camps in Wayanad alone. Kerala government has declared a two-day state mourning.

Whoever raises issues of the Dalits and backwards, has to face abuses ... I don't want any apology,"" Rahul said.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reacted strongly to Anurag Thakur's attack and asked Prime Minister Modi to clarify if this was done on his instructions.Caste census is the demand of 80% of India's population. Today in Parliament an objectionable remark was made for those seeking caste census. Will 80% of Indians be now abused in the House? Narendra Modiji should clarify if this was done at his behest? Priyanka posted on X alongwith a video of the faceoff.Condemning the remarks, head of the Congress's media and publicity department Pawan Khera said that the ""Gandhi family's caste is martyrdom"".Khera highlighted that Thakur's words targeting Rahul Gandhi have struck a chord with the public, causing widespread anger and resentment. He said, ""The real face of the BJP has come to the fore. This mindset can only be of the BJP that such abuses are used for a person who is the son of a family of martyrs. He is told that your caste is not known. We will tell you what his caste is. Rahul Gandhi's father is a martyr and this family's caste is martyrdom. This the RSS, the BJP and Thakur can never understand.""Khera affirmed that the fight for justice and the implementation of a caste census in the country will continue, regardless of the abuse directed at the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party.(With inputs from agencies)",Anurag Thakaur's remarks triggered a storm in the House. Rahul said that he is being abused and insulted because he is speaking for the oppressed.

Gujarat court orders FIR over call to boycott Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/court-orders-firs-over-muslim-boycott-in-riot-hit-gujarat-village/articleshow/112147243.cms,"AHMEDABAD: A court in Gujarat 's Patan has ordered FIRs against several people on charges that they had called for an economic boycott of Muslims in a village after riots in July 2023 over a social media post .Magistrate HP Joshi asked police to register the FIRs after it emerged that many Muslims in Balisana village lost their livelihood and some had to leave.This was based on specific allegations by Makbulhusen Shekh, a villager who claimed his complaint with police earlier had gone unheeded. Magistrate Joshi ordered the cops to file the FIR under sections pertaining to promoting disharmony and communal enmity , criminal conspiracy and furthering a common agenda.After the communal violence in Balisana on July 16, 2023, Shekh filed his complaint on Sept 8, 2023 with Patan SP claiming a video showed some Patels inciting other villagers against Muslims. According to Shekh, the Patels had called for the economic boycott of Muslims by ending contracts to force them out of rented shops in the village market.After cops sat on his complaint, Shekh moved the Patan court demanding an FIR under several sections related to promoting enmity and IT Act as the alleged incitement was through a video. When the court ordered Balisana police to inquire, cops recommended closing the case. The police presented statements of the accused claiming they had called for boycott of Muslims because the latter had caused ""breach of peace and were likely to cause disturbances again"".The accused contended that while they had suggested to villagers to cancel some rent agreements, they had never forced any shop-owner to evict Muslim tenants.The court, however, did not believe the police report as the complainant's advocate, Yusuf Shaikh, placed statements by many Muslims saying they had lost livelihoods and shops around the time the boycott call was issued.","Magistrate HP Joshi asked police to register the FIRs after it emerged that many Muslims in Balisana village lost their livelihood and some had to leave.

Be the primary driving force of development: PM Modi to private sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/be-the-primary-driving-force-of-development-pm-modi-to-private-sector/articleshow/112150688.cms,"Nirmala slams Oppn, says no state denied funds in Budget



NEW DELHI: In a strong message to investors and opponents, PM Modi Tuesday said his govt was not lacking in political will to take decisions based on a ""nation first"" approach and urged ""wealth creators to be the primary driving force"" of development, in what was seen as a retort to Congress's repeated allegations of crony capitalism by the BJP-led coalition govt.At a post-budget event organised by CII, Modi told a gathering of businessmen that he had not shied away from backing the private sector even during his Independence Day speech.A combative Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said no state had been denied money in the Budget and asserted that govt had increased allocation for agriculture , health and social sectors , refuting allegations levelled by the opposition .""I have been picking up on Budget speeches since 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and so on. The Budget of 2004-2005 did not take the name of 17 states. I would like to ask members of the UPA govt at that time, did money not go to those 17 states? Did they stop it?"" the finance minister said while replying to the debate in Lok Sabha. The comments came in response to statements by opposition MPs that Bihar and Andhra Pradesh were provided funds while several others did not get money.Sitharaman said the Budget had provided financial support of Rs 17,000 crore to J&K this year, including Rs 12,000 crore for J&K Police. ""That's the burden we want to take on our shoulders,"" she said, adding that road projects had been announced in Kerala.After Sitharaman's speech, PM Modi said on X, ""FM Nirmala Sitharaman presents a very comprehensive picture of this year's Budget and what it offers for every section of society. She reiterates our govt's commitment to growth and reforms.""Sitharaman said repeated attacks on institutions and businesses were a conspiracy. ""Today, India's social fabric, parliamentary traditions, economy and Army, all four are being severely attacked... Entrepreneurship itself is being made a villain... Negativity is being spread towards all those who do business. There is a conspiracy to send a message to the entire world that India is not safe for investors,"" the finance minister said.Positioning her Budget as a balance between social objectives and fiscal consolidation, she said Modi govt had made fiscal prudence, without compromising on welfare schemes, the hallmark of its economic policy. Sitharaman once again slammed Congress-led UPA for off-Budget borrowings, which made the exercise non-transparent.Stating that formal employment was badly hit during the UPA regime, Sitharaman reeled out multiple reports to argue how more jobs were being created now.She went on to compare the inflation track record, arguing that during the 10 years of UPA the average inflation was 8.1%, compared with 5.1% during Modi's two terms.She hit back at Congress for its demand for MSP guarantee, saying UPA did not accept the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission. Countering opposition's claims of allocation for SCs/STs being pared, she said, ""I would like to ask those questioning us: out of Karnataka govt's SC/ST fund of Rs 9,980 crore in the budget, Rs 4,301 out of the tribal sub-plan cannot be located. Congress leaders must question their leadership on what's happening with the SCs in Karnataka.""","PM Modi urges ""wealth creators to be the primary driving force"" of development.

This is why Western Ghats need to be tagged eco-sensitive area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-is-why-western-ghats-need-to-be-tagged-eco-sensitive-area/articleshow/112149055.cms,"NEW DELHI: Landslides that hit the ecologically fragile region of Wayanad in Kerala on Tuesday is a stark reminder of the failure of successive govts in notifying the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive area ( ESA ) - a prerequisite to preserving the terrain by banning environmentally hazardous human activities.Despite five draft notifications by the Union environment ministry since March 2014, the states - initially Kerala but later mainly Karnataka - are still not on board for final notification leaving ecologically sensitive areas unprotected.It is learnt that one more draft notification, the sixth one, is expected to be issued in a day or two as the validity of the fifth notification expired a month ago. The draft will give yet another chance to work towards building consensus that has eluded the region for the last 10 years.The entire Western Ghats, spread over six states including Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, is the second most landslide-prone region of the country after Himalayas. Though Maharashtra and Goa sought a reduction in the extent of ESA within the respective states for allowing development works, the then govt in Karnataka urged the Centre in 2022 to withdraw the draft arguing that it would adversely affect the livelihood of the people in the state.Absence of ESA cover to Western Ghats, meanwhile, resulted in continuation of several environmentally-hazardous human activities, including massive deforestation for mining and construction over the years, leading to loosening of soil and affecting hillside stability -- the main reason of landslides during extremely heavy rainfall like the ones that struck Kerala.IMD data shows that the state received 537% more than normal daily (24 hours) rainfall on July 30. “The landslide was caused by very heavy rainfall over the region during the last two days. Soil conditions were conducive with previous episodes of rains,” Madhavan Rajeevan, former secretary of ministry of earth sciences (MoES), told TOI.He said though the heavy precipitation was predicted by MoES based on scientific models, the question remained how the prior information could translate into landslide warning. “We need a multi-institutional framework for developing robust landslide prediction systems. We know the science of landslides well. We need to convert it into good services,” said Rajeevan, vice-chancellor of Atria University, Bengaluru.Experts also believe that controlled deforestation and adoption of sustainable development models could have prevented such disasters in the region impacted by climate change.“The devastating landslides in Wayanad, fueled by excessive monsoon rains, underscore the urgent need to address the impacts of climate change. Kerala has increasingly suffered from such events, which are closely tied to global warming and climate change, driving irregular and heavy rainfall patterns,” said Anjal Prakash, climate change expert and research director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business (ISB).Prakash, clinical associate professor at ISB, too believed that implementing robust early warning systems with enhanced weather forecasting technologies can provide timely alerts about heavy rainfall and potential landslides, enabling residents to evacuate and prepare.“Additionally, promoting sustainable land management through reforestation, controlled deforestation, and sustainable agriculture is crucial for maintaining hillside stability and reducing soil erosion, thus lessening the effects of heavy rains,” he said","Landslides that hit the ecologically fragile region of Wayanad in Kerala on Tuesday is a stark reminder of the failure of successive govts in notifying the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive area.

The safety reviews are complemented with periodic inspections and observation by the resident site observer team. “Board assured itself of the systematic regulatory oversight by the AERB, took cognisance of the detailed submissions presented, safety review outcomes tabled and also visited the plant. Based on the above, the said permission was granted,” he said.“This permission marks a significant step towards operationalisation of PFBR. The 500MWe sodium cooled PFBR being commissioned by BHAVINI at Kalpakkam is a significant milestone in the country's nuclear power programme.In line with the govt’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign, PFBR has been fully designed and constructed indigenously by Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd (BHAVINI)— which was created in 2003 to construct and operate India’s most advanced nuclear reactor-PFBR — with significant contributions from Indian industries.Earlier this year, the core loading activity of PFBR was initiated in a phased manner beginning with insertion of control sub-assemblies followed by blanket sub-assemblies with necessary permissions from AERB.In the final stage of core loading, fuel sub-assemblies would be loaded in the core of the reactor following which the nuclear fission process would commence. On attainment of sustained nuclear fission chain reaction, a phenomenon known as criticality of the reactor, various low power physics experiments would be conducted.","The 500 MWe sodium-cooled prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) located at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu has finally got approval from atomic regulator Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.

However, it agreed to adjourn the hearing to Aug 6.On July 15, a bench headed by the CJI had issued notice to Centre on Nagaland's plea challenging denial of sanction for prosecution of 30 Army men who were named in the FIR lodged by the state police for killing 13 civilians in a botched operation to ambush militants in Mon district on Dec 4, 2021.When the bench led by Justice Nath took up the petitions challenging registration of FIR, Balgopal said only one of the two benches should hear both the petitions, as these pertained to the same incident.However, senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said Nagaland's writ petition challenging Centre's decision refusing sanction for prosecution concerned an issue which was completely different from the subject matter before this bench. ""We are questioning the very inception of the prosecution through registration of FIR. This bench had, during the earlier hearing, expressed its prima facie view that the FIR needs to be closed as there was no prior sanction for its registration,"" Ahmadi said.Ahmadi also accused Nagaland of suppressing facts in the writ petition before the CJI-led bench challenging a more than year-old decision of Union govt to refuse sanction for prosecution. ""None of the interim orders passed by this bench, including the one staying the FIR and prosecution of the Army personnel, was annexed to the writ petition even though the deponent was fully aware of the developments,"" he said.Justice Nath said even if the bench closed the FIRs, the prosecution could be commenced afresh if Nagaland govt succeeded before the CJI-led bench.

Another significant change is that any case pertaining to illegal conversion will have to be heard by a sessions court or higher.The Bill, tabled by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna on behalf of CM Yogi Adityanath, includes two sub-clauses. The first introduces a fine of Rs 10 lakh and imprisonment of up to 14 years if the convict is found associated with ""foreign"" or ""illegal"" agencies. Under the second clause, the convict would be liable for a jail term ranging from 20 years to life if found guilty of unlawful religious conversion ""by luring/provoking a person, essentially a minor girl or women from the SC/ST community"".The convict could also be ordered to pay compensation to the victim to cover livelihood and medication expenses. Khanna said there was ""nothing controversial"" about an amendment to a Bill aiming to ""bring justice to victims subjected to unlawful religious conversions"".The bid to curb forced religious conversion started with an ordinance brought by the Yogi government in Nov 2020. A Bill was passed later by both Houses of the UP legislature.

The comments came in response to statements by opposition MPs that Bihar and Andhra Pradesh were provided funds while several others did not get money.Sitharaman said the Budget had provided financial support of Rs 17,000 crore to J&K this year, including Rs 12,000 crore for J&K Police. ""That's the burden we want to take on our shoulders,"" she said, adding that road projects had been announced in Kerala.After Sitharaman's speech, PM Modi said on X, ""FM Nirmala Sitharaman presents a very comprehensive picture of this year's Budget and what it offers for every section of society. She reiterates our govt's commitment to growth and reforms.""Sitharaman said repeated attacks on institutions and businesses were a conspiracy. ""Today, India's social fabric, parliamentary traditions, economy and Army, all four are being severely attacked... Entrepreneurship itself is being made a villain... Negativity is being spread towards all those who do business. There is a conspiracy to send a message to the entire world that India is not safe for investors,"" the finance minister said.Positioning her Budget as a balance between social objectives and fiscal consolidation, she said Modi govt had made fiscal prudence, without compromising on welfare schemes, the hallmark of its economic policy. Sitharaman once again slammed Congress-led UPA for off-Budget borrowings, which made the exercise non-transparent.Stating that formal employment was badly hit during the UPA regime, Sitharaman reeled out multiple reports to argue how more jobs were being created now.She went on to compare the inflation track record, arguing that during the 10 years of UPA the average inflation was 8.1%, compared with 5.1% during Modi's two terms.She hit back at Congress for its demand for MSP guarantee, saying UPA did not accept the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission. Countering opposition's claims of allocation for SCs/STs being pared, she said, ""I would like to ask those questioning us: out of Karnataka govt's SC/ST fund of Rs 9,980 crore in the budget, Rs 4,301 out of the tribal sub-plan cannot be located. Congress leaders must question their leadership on what's happening with the SCs in Karnataka.""","Nirmala Sitharaman says no state had been denied money in the Budget. Opposition MPs said Bihar and Andhra Pradesh were provided funds while several others did not get money.

Relief for law grads as Supreme Court caps fees for advocate enrolment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relief-for-law-grads-as-supreme-court-caps-fees-for-advocate-enrolment/articleshow/112147264.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a huge relief to young law graduates who have to cough up huge sums to enroll as advocates, Supreme Court Tuesday ruled that Bar Council of India (BCI) and state bar councils (SBCs) cannot charge more than Rs 700 to register them as advocates, who alone are entitled to practice in courts.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala said charging thousands of rupees from lawyers, even before they started earning from law practice, for enrolment is violative of right to dignity that encompasses right to develop one's potential to the fullest and discriminates persons from marginalised communities as it denudes their right to equal participation.At present, SBCs insist on thousands of rupees as miscellaneous charges along with registration fee. Odisha charges the highest at Rs 42,000, followed by Manipur at 16,600 and Maharashtra Rs 15,000.Section 24 of Advocates Act stipulates a lawyer registering as an advocate is to pay fee of Rs 600 to SBC and Rs 100 to BCI along with stamp duty. In case of a SC or ST lawyer, the enrolment fee of Rs 100 is payable to SBC and Rs 25 to BCI.Allowing a PIL filed by one Gaurav Kumar, the bench said, ""SBCs and BCI are directed to ensure that the fees charged at the time of enrollment comply with Section 24(1)(f) and the provision is not defeated under the garb of different nomenclatures.

'Shared intent' sufficient ground for conviction in gang-rape case: Bombay high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shared-intent-sufficient-ground-for-conviction-in-gang-rape-case-bombay-high-court/articleshow/112146781.cms,"NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of Bombay high court upheld the conviction of four men for gang rape, clarifying that direct participation in the sexual assault was not necessary to establish guilt. If there was evidence of shared intent , it was sufficient for conviction, the court said.Justice Govinda Sanap dismissed the appeals filed by the four accused, who had challenged their conviction and sentence handed down by Chandrapur sessions court.Sandip Talande, Kunal Ghodam, Shubham Ghodam and Ashok Kannake were awarded 20 years of rigorous imprisonment on Aug 20, 2018, for the gang rape of a woman on June 14, 2015.The court held that although only two of the accused raped the woman, shared intent made the other two equally culpable.The woman and her friend were sitting under a tree after visiting a temple when the accused approached them, posing as forest department officials, and demanded Rs 10,000. When they expressed their inability to pay, they were thrashed and their mobile phones were snatched. Sandip and Shubham then raped her, while Kunal and Ashok restrained her friend from intervening.""The two accused dragged the victim behind a tree, while the remaining two overpowered the victim's friend. This action clearly indicates their knowledge and intention, making them equally culpable,"" Justice Sanap said.The accused fled the scene after a forest guard arrived. The survivor and her friend reported the crime to police, and a medical examination confirmed rape.Justice Sanap found no merit in the contention that Kunal and Ashok could not be convicted for gang rape, based on evidence. ""They could have been saved from law, provided they had not overpowered the survivor's friend. If he was not overpowered, he would have tried to save her and prevented the accused from committing this ghastly act,"" the judge said, adding that the duo facilitated the crime committed by the other two accused, Shubham and Sandip.","Nagpur bench of Bombay high court upheld the conviction of four men for gang rape.
