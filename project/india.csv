"Tiger burning brighter in Sundarbans, but villagers are smiling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tiger-burning-brighter-in-sundarbans-but-villagers-are-smiling/articleshow/110480158.cms,"KOLKATA: From man-eater to a resource option, the tigers in Indian Sundarbans seem to have undergone an image makeover over the past one decade as the big cats now provide alternative livelihood to hundreds of people on the delta in West Bengal.The forest villages in Sundarbans — a delta formed by the confluence of Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal — mostly fall under Joynagar Lok Sabha constituency which has over 8 lakh voters. As the Sundarbans is set for elections on Saturday, ecotourism guides and tour operators feel a slew of protourism measures such as opening more routes and entry points post elections will not only lead to a rise in footfall but also prevent incidents such as the killing of a guard inside the forest recently.A good number of villagers , who used to sneak into the woods on illegal fishing trips, now either steer tourism boats, act as nature guides or cook food on boats during photography tours of the mangroves in the delta.Four human deaths have been reported so far this year, in addition to over 10 last year, from the swampland due to tiger attacks. The figure was 21 in 2022. In all cases, victims had ventured into the core area where fishing is banned. The stats are official, actual figures may be higher.A 12km forest stretch under Sundarbans Tiger Reserve where human settlements are located just opposite got a fresh cover of nylon net fencing recently so that straying tigers won’t disrupt the poll process.In a terrain where humananimal conflict is on the rise, tiger tourism has come as a silver lining.Satadal Manna (name changed), who used to venture into the woods for crabs a couple of years ago, now cooks delicious food for tourists on boats.The stories of his family members getting into forest for livelihood never attracted 20-year-old Ananda Mondal (name changed), who got behind the wheels of a boat at just 13 years. He is now a trusted name in the mangroves tourism sector as far as sighting of wildlife is concerned.Asked if he had ever seen the elusive swamp tiger in the mangroves, he replied: “Can’t keep count.”A rise in annual tourist footfall — from about 1 lakh until 2012-13 to more than 2 lakhs now — keeps the boatmen and guides busy.Film crews, both national and international, have set their sights on Sundarbans.Soumyajit Nandy, a photographer, naturalist, and tour operator, said: “Sundarbans, on the Indian side (other on Bangladesh side), was never known for tiger sightings. Not even one was sighted in a month. Now multiple sightings take place in a month.”Nandy said opening more routes and multiple entry points would help villagers of more islands reap the benefits of tourism. The department can thus disperse the tourism pressure, which is concentrated now on a single zone in the reserve — the Sajnekhali eco-tourism zone, he said.“The activity is limited now to villages near the Sajnekhali tourism zone. If multiple entry points are opened in places like Basirhat, Kakdwip or Namkhana, more villagers can be brought under the ambit of tourism which will also result in less depen dency on forest,” he added.Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve director Nilanjan Mullick said: “The sightings show tiger numbers are stable in the Sundarbans. There are reports of tiger sightings al most every day now.”He said the situation has gradually changed with the increase in the number of tourists visiting the mangroves in the last few years.“Initially, the infrastructure wasn’t very good, but it has been developed in the last few years. Besides, management protocols have borne fruit and led to a rise in tiger population,” he said, adding that steps would also be taken in due course keeping an eye on tourist inflow.“Now, tiger sightings have increased and a pointer towards the fact is sighting of cubs. Steps, including opening of a few more routes that help serious wildlife tourism flourish, are welcome,” said naturalist and tour operator Nityananda Chowkidar.“With an increase in tourism activities, people have also stopped venturing into the forest to a large extent,” Chowkidar added.They need not. The returns are attractive. From a three-night, four-day photography tour (with five persons) costing Rs 85,000, an operator can make a profit of at least 15%-20%. If the operator owns a boat and homestay, it can go up to 25% after making payment to naturalists, cooks, boatmen and for forest permits.Political parties, particularly Trinamool Congress, have highlighted these issues during their poll campaigns. South 24 Parganas Zilla Parishad deputy speaker Animesh Mondal of Trinamool Congress said they have been highlighting the importance of homestays to boost wildlife tourism in the area.“We had approached the tourism department to open new homestays in the last financial year. We will do it again this year. Also, we are focusing on promoting birding hot spots in the buffer areas and near the villages,” Mondal said.Another guide said since tourists are considered additional eyes and ears of the forest, the department should take a pro-tourism approach as it can keep incidents such as the killing of the guard inside the forest at bay.","Four human deaths have been reported so far this year, in addition to over 10 last year, from the swampland due to tiger attacks. Forest villages in Sundarbans — a delta formed by the confluence of Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers — mostly fall under Joynagar Lok Sabha constituency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110480162,imgsize-1464258,width-400,resizemode-4/110480162.jpg"
‘Snubbed’ Sita Soren lays claim on Shibu Soren legacy & seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/snubbed-sita-lays-claim-on-soren-legacy-seat/articleshow/110480119.cms,"DUMKA: A sleepy town in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana , Dumka first drew everybody’s attention in Oct 1990 when Lalu Prasad Yadav , the then CM of undivided Bihar, placed BJP leader L K Advani under arrest at a Bihar govt guest house in Massanjore at the site of a dam on the banks of the Mayurakshi after halting his Ram Rath Yatra in Samastipur.Around the same time, JMM patriarch Shibu Soren had just been re-elected to Parliament from Dumka, a reserved seat for tribals, and was spearheading a movement against Lalu’s govt for a separate state of Jharkhand comprising tribal-dominated areas of south Bihar.Cut to May 2024, Hemant and Tejashwi, sons of Shibu and Lalu respectively, have joined hands as INDIA bloc partners to take on BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.However, the alliance suffered a setback just three days after the Lok Sabha polls were announced when Sita Soren , Shibu’s eldest bahu, abandoned ship and crossed over to BJP.Sita also resigned as the JMM MLA from the Jama seat. Soon after, BJP announced her candidature from the Dumka seat recalling its earlier nominee, sitting MP Sunil Soren, who had defeated Shibu in the 2019 general election by nearly 50,000 votes. Sita has been quite vocal in criticising her late husband’s family and JMM.Campaigning in Dumka, which will vote on June 1, has been hectic. Sita has been holding door-to-door campaigns and conducting public meetings in the villages.Addressing the crowds, mostly poor tribal men, women, and children, in Santhali, she said: “The Jharkhand that you see today is a result of Guru ji (Shibu) and the vision of the late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Even though Modiji built Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, like in Ramayana, this Sita was sent to vanvas (exile) for 14 years by her own family after the death of her husband.”Dumka is known as a JMM bastion. Party president Shibu has won the seat eight times since 1980 and lost four times (1984, 1998, 1999 and 2019). Although considered an impregnable fortress, BJP has breached it several times in the past, the last being in 2019 when Sunil beat Shibu.Now, with former chief minister Hemant Soren behind bars since Jan 31 after his arrest in a land scam case, Shibu’s pocket borough faces threat from his own daughter in-law. Two months after her “devar” (younger brother-in law) was arrested, Sita switched to BJP citing continuous neglect by the Soren family.In her public discourse, Sita has often said, “Hemant has not seen struggles in his life. It was baba (Shibu) and my husband (Durga) who fought for a separate state and endured hardship. All he knows is kursi (chair) and AC (airconditioner). A member of the family (referring to Kalpana Soren) is going around the state giving slogans like ‘Jail ka tala tutega, Hemant Soren chhutega’. How does she intend to break the lock? Can anyone arrest a CM, who is the most powerful person in a state, without evidence?”Sita’s late husband Durga was groomed by Shibu as his political successor. With Durga’s sudden death in 2009, Hemant, the third among Shi bu’s four children, was thrust into the political arena.“I had no intention of joining politics. I wanted to become an architect but had to drop out (of BIT Mesra) as the central agencies were harassing my family. Then, I wanted to be a businessman, but bhaiya’s death and father’s illness changed everything,” Hemant had told TOI in an interview in 2019.Sita was elected MLA from Jama, Durga’s old constituency, thrice (2009, 2014 and 2019) but was not inducted into the cabinet by Hemant even though he was the chief minister twice (2013-14 and 2019-2024). The 52-year-old was even ignored when Champai, a Shibu loyalist, took oath in Feb this year following Hemant’s arrest. Basant, a first-time MLA (from Dumka) and Shibu’s youngest son, was made transport minister.Interestingly, there were rumours that Sita switched to BJP following pressure to do so. With Supreme Court ruling in March this year that MPs and MLAs were not immune to prosecution for accepting bribes for votes or making a speech in the House in a particular fashion, it became clear that Sita, who is facing a horse-trading case in a CBI court in Ranchi, would face trial.Dismissing the rumours, Sita, claimed, “The case has been going on for many years now. Had that been the reason, I would have been in BJP much earlier. I joined BJP because I was not being respected in my party.”For BJP, which is fighting Lok Sabha elections in Jharkhand on the corruption plank (with focus on the arrest of Hemant, Congress minister Alamgir Alam and senior IAS officers in separate money laundering and illegal mining cases), Sita’s attacks could further dent the JMM-led INDIA bloc’s image in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana division, where JMM and Congress won 16 out of 18 seats in the 2019 assembly polls.On the law and order front, Dumka doesn’t have a good record with news of crimes, particularly against women and children, often hitting headlines.A Spanish woman who was on a global bike tour with her husband was gang-raped in Dumka. It was also where a Class 12 student was set on fire by her stalker and his accomplice while she was asleep. She died of burn injuries days later, in Aug 2022. BJP, which has been accusing the JMM-led coalition govt of turning a blind eye to illegal immigration from Bangladesh, had then accused the govt of appeasing minorities.“In Dumka, Shibu is respected across party lines. BJP does not speak ill of him, given his political stature and popularity among the tribals,” said Ramesh Mandal, a BJP worker from Nala in Jamtara district. “Yes, it is true that Sita broke away from the family, but BJP supporters do not look at the candidate. They only look at the symbol and PM Modi,” he added.Nalin Soren, a seven-time JMM MLA and Sita’s opponent, calls her “bahu”. “She is my daughter-in-law, too. I haven’t spoken to her since she left JMM but until the polls are over, she is my opponent. She talks about neglect, but it was the family that made her MLA thrice from Jama after her husband’s death. It was the party that made her win, not her charisma,” he added.",JMM patriarch Shibu Soren's daughter-in-law Sita Soren has joined hands with BJP. Sita has been quite vocal in criticising her late husband’s family and JMM. She has been holding door-to-door campaigns and conducting public meetings in villages.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110480137,imgsize-1235377,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110480137.jpg"
Agnikul's single-stage tech demo rocket launch put on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnikuls-single-stage-tech-demo-rocket-launch-put-on-hold/articleshow/110479525.cms,"BENGALURU: Agnikul Cosmos, a spacetech startup, which hoped to make history with the inaugural test launch of its single-stage technology demonstrator rocket — a precursor for its Agnibaan launch vehicle — powered by a semi-cryogenic engine Agnilet, put the launch on ""hold” just minutes before lift off on Tuesday.

The company as of 6.12am was yet to officially call off the launch, but live coverage to the Agnibaan’s “SubOrbital Technological Demonstrator or SOrTeD” mission had been stopped. Teams are looking into anomalies that prompted the firm to put the launch on hold.

The IIT-incubated startup had, earlier this year, scheduled SOrTeD for an April 7 launch, but was forced to postpone due to technical glitches just 129 seconds before lift-off.

“Had to call off today’s launch attempt of Agnibaan SOrTeD just a second into Automated Launch Sequence (ALS) initiation because of a communication issue between two of our onboard hardware. Although it is frustrating to see a HOLD this close to lift off, we are glad that our ALS did its job,” the firm had said on the day.

PUNE: Two doctors from Sassoon general hospital , arrested on Monday for destruction of evidence against the minor accused in Pune Porsche crash that killed two techies, were sent to police custody till May 30 by court.According to the police, the blood samples of the underage driver were discarded in a dustbin and substituted with samples from another individual, which showed no evidence of alcohol consumption. The arrested individuals have been identified as Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware. The court has remanded them in police custody until May 30.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI, ""We have arrested Taware and Halnor for changing the blood samples and manipulating the blood sample reports. We studied the entire procedure at the hospital and realised the manipulation. Our team then decided to arrest the two doctors"".“The minor’s first blood sample was collected at around 11 am on May 19 at Sassoon hospital (eight-and-a-half hours after the accident) and the second was collected at the Aundh-based hospital around 7pm, to rule out the possibility of any manipulation like replacement of blood samples. Both these samples were sent for DNA fingerprinting to FSL. The blood sample which was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin of the hospital and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab. During the investigation, we found Srihari Halnor replaced this on the instructions of the HOD Forensic Medicine Department of Sassoon, Ajay Tawre. The DNA fingerprinting of the minor’s father was done at FSL after his arrest last Tuesday in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” he said.The senior police official further said that as an abundant precaution, they had taken one more sample of the juvenile for DNA sampling and it was sent to another hospital.""The report of the other hospital revealed the juvenile's blood report at the Sassoon Hospital was manipulated as the DNA of (blood samples of) both the reports did not match,"" he said.Both the doctors did not have any idea that the police would take one more sample (of the accused juvenile), he said.""A probe is underway on whose blood samples were collected to replace with that of the juvenile's. We have recovered CCTV footages of the Sassoon Hospital and further probe is on,"" Kumar said.He also said that Indian Penal sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections have been added to the case in which the juvenile has been booked.""We have made the juvenile's father co-accused in the present case,"" he said.""The juvenile's father had called the doctor and offered him allurements to replace the blood samples,"" Commissioner Amitesh Kumar added.The accident, which occurred in the early morning of May 19, resulted in the deaths of two IT professionals when their motorcycle was struck by a speeding Porsche Taycan car at Kalyaninagar at 2.30 am, allegedly driven by the minor.The police have also obtained CCTV footage from one of the pubs visited by the boy, where he reportedly paid a bill amounting to Rs 48,000.The minor accused, who was taken to Sasoon Hospital for a medical examination, had his blood sample allegedly switched with another sample during the course of the investigation.According to the police, the teenager was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. It was later discovered that the minor's blood report was swapped with that of another individual who had not consumed alcohol.As the police awaited the blood sample reports, the manipulation came to light. To prevent any further tampering, the police had collected two samples from the boy. According to the Pune police commissioner, second blood sample indicated alcohol consumption by the teen accused.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to the teenager and instructed him to write an essay about road accidents. However, due to public outrage over the lenient treatment and a review application submitted by the police, the teenager was remanded to an observation home until June 5.Earlier, the Crime Branch unit arrested the grandfather of the minor accused on May 25 in connection with the accident. Pune city commissioner said that a separate FIR was filed against the grandfather under IPC sections 365 and 368.The driver, Gangadhar, filed a complaint with the police claiming that he was forcibly taken to the accused grandfather's residence on the night of May 19 while leaving the Yerawada Police Station.The accused grandfather and his father allegedly threatened Gangadhar, snatched his phone and forcibly kept him confined in their bungalow in an attempt to force him to take responsibility for the crime instead of his minor grandson.The Maharashtra government has set up a three-member committee in response to the arrest of two doctors and an employee from Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The order appointing the committee was issued by Medical Education Commissioner Rajiv Nivatkar on Monday, with Dr Pallavi Sapale, dean of Grant Medical College and J J group of hospitals, serving as the chairperson.The committee also includes Dr Gajanan Chavan, a professor in the forensic medicine department at Grant Medical College, and Dr Sudhir Chowdhary, the Special Duty Officer at Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar Government Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital.

The National Testing Agency (NTA) is expected to release the provisional answer for the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test, Undergraduate (NEET-UG) 2024 soon. The (NEET-UG) 2024 exam, conducted on May 5, 2024 from 2:00 PM to 5:20 PM, accommodated more than 24 lakh candidates in 557 cities across India and 14 international locations. According to certain media reports, The NEET-UG answer key is anticipated to be released on May 28.

NEW DELHI: Claiming that the country is under dictatorship, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal accused Union home minister Amit Shah of threatening to topple the Bhagwant Mann government in Punjab after the Lok Sabha polls. This comes after Shah, at a poll rally in Ludhiana, asked people to ensure the BJP's victory in Punjab and said, ""the Bhagwant Mann government will not last long after the BJP's victory.""Referencing Shah's statement while addressing a gathering of traders in Amritsar, Kejriwal said, ""He gave a threat. He issued a threat that after June 4, the Punjab government will be toppled. Bhagwant Mann will no longer remain the chief minister after June 4.""Kejriwal questioned the possibility of toppling the government, saying, ""We have 92 seats (MLAs). How can you topple (government)? There is a dictatorship (in the country).""He alleged that BJP leaders were openly saying they would threaten the legislators with the CBI and the ED and then ""buy"" them and added, ""Do not threaten the people of Punjab. Otherwise, they will make it difficult for you to enter Punjab.""During an interaction in Bathinda, Kejriwal asked Shah to explain what ""conspiracy"" has been hatched to topple the AAP government in Punjab.

'Unwell' CM Kejriwal seeks interim bail till June 9 for medical tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unwell-cm-kejriwal-seeks-interim-bail-till-june-9-for-medical-tests/articleshow/110475566.cms,"Kejriwal: No time before polls end on June 1 to go for tests

NEW DELHI: With the deadline for him to return to Tihar Jail a week away, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday moved Supreme Court seeking extension of time to surrender till June 9 on the ground that he needed to undergo a comprehensive medical examination to identify whether his ""unusually high blood sugar level , rapid weight loss and bouts of dizziness, coupled with palpitation"", were life-threatening.Arrested by Enforcement Directorate on March 21 in a money laundering case relating to the alleged excise policy scam and released on interim bail by the apex court on May 10 for campaigning, the 54-year-old Kejriwal said a senior physician from Max Hospital clinically examined him on May 25 and suggested whole body PET-CT to rule out malignancies and Holter monitor test, both of which would take 5-7 days.Kejriwal said since elections in Punjab were scheduled for June 1, he would be busy campaigning till May 30, and would not be able to undergo these tests in a day. Assuring that he had and would scrupulously abide by the interim bail conditions, Kejriwal requested SC to extend his interim bail period by a week till June 9 to enable him to undergo the tests.The CM said he suffered from “an aggressive form of diabetes mellitus, which is very volatile and undergoes a wide range of swings in blood glucose, including episodes of high sugar, that is hyperglycemia, and low sugar, that is hypoglycemia”.He claimed that during his incarceration from March 21 till his release on May 10, the “negligent and callous behaviour of jail authorities” were partly responsible for his health-related complications, adding that during the period of custody, he suffered weight loss of around 6-7 kg, which he was not able to regain even after renewing his earlier lifestyle since his release from prison.The CM said he has also “started experiencing periodic episodes of giddiness, palpitation and overwhelming lethargy. In the meantime, recent test reports confirm that the appellant has also developed an unusually high blood glucose level as well as high ketone levels in urine, which indicate that in addition to increased blood sugar level, the appellant may have also developed kidney-related complications and kidney damage”.Kejriwal said if Delhi high court had not upheld his illegal and mala fide arrest, he would have had 60 days of campaigning time. Because of the supreme Court’s interim bail, he got 21 days to campaign, during which he campaigned in Delhi and across India, as a result, he had only time for health check-ups at home.The CM said his “present health complications and increased risk indicators warrant that these tests are carried out before his surrender, to avoid any aggravation during his further incarceration and any potential long-term damage to his health and life. Non-identification of the health issues at this stage, can have potentially very catastrophic consequences to his health and life”.Earlier on Monday, minister Atishi said Kejriwal had sought extension of his interim bail as he needed to undergo tests. “Kejriwal has filed for a seven-day extension of his interim bail. When he was in ED custody, judicial custody, he lost 7 kg of weight. This sudden weight loss is a matter of concern for doctors,” she said.“Despite being out of custody and under medical supervision, he has not been able to regain the weight again. Early tests have indicated that his ketone levels are extremely high. Unexplained sudden weight loss along with high ketone levels could be the indicator of some serious medical ailments, including damage to the kidneys, including cancer,” she said. “Therefore, doctors have suggested that he needs to have a series of investigations, including PET scans of his entire body, and other such serious tests,"" the minister said.","Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday moved Supreme Court seeking extension of time to surrender till June 9.

Nine years are all it took for FTII graduate Payal Kapadia to go from ""anti-national"" to toast of the nation. The young filmmaker , whose 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday, was a student at the country's cradle of cinema and TV when she braved chants of ""go to Pakistan"" for participating in a 139-day protest in 2015 against the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairperson.She, along with 34 other former students, continue to wage a legal battle over a case filed by the then institute's director, Prashant Pathrabe, alleging their involvement in gheraoing him and vandalising his office that year.But a day after conquering Cannes, there was not a trace of rancour in Payal's words. All she reflected was the afterglow of an unprecedented triumph that she gracefully shared with fellow filmmakers from India.""It's a great feeling to receive this prize because there are so many good films from India alongside ours, and we feel a part of the larger family of filmmakers. We have three films from FTII directors this time. My FTII batchmate Maisam Ali's film 'In Retreat' is the first Indian entry to Cannes' ACID sidebar (Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema),"" she told TOI from the French Riviera.Payal’s film on 2015 FTII stir had also won Cannes laurelAlso, an FTII student’s (Chidananda Naik) film, titled ‘Sunflowers Were the First to Know’, won the main prize in La Cinef section. It’s fantastic for us and FTII.” Payal’s batchmates and other alumni recall that the 2015 protest was “against the appointment of people who had no achievement in filmmaking” but were allegedly included in FTII’s governing council for political reasons.Harishankar Nachimuthu, ex-president of FTII Students’ Association and spearhead of the agitation, said Payal always had a vision about where she wanted to go and was willing to fight it out. “She was denied a scholarship and a foreign exchange opportunity for participating in the four-month protest. But even she would agree that FTII made us better filmmakers, better human beings, and responsible citizens,” he said.Payal credited her teachers and students at FTII for her success, saying that while not everyone needed to go to a film school, the institute benefited her with a structure that facilitates the dissemination of different cinematic ideas. “It is also a great place to meet people who share a love for cinema. My batchmates were instrumental in shaping my ideas. At FTII, we got to see films from all over the world and this exposure helped me make my film.”Payal’s peers and seniors see her as a film aficionado perpetually behind the camera, documenting various subjects, and relentlessly pursuing any project she takes up to fruition.Ajayan Adat, winner of the 53rd Kerala State Film Awards for best sound design, was Payal’s senior by two years in college. He said her big qualities were patience and diligence. “She was pained by the then govt’s attitude against the students’ protest. So she took out a camera and started filming everything. She made hours of footage into a documentary titled ‘Night of Knowing Nothing’. It won the L’Oeil d’Or at Cannes in 2021.”","'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday.

2 convicted of murder even in absence of victim's body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-convicted-of-murder-even-in-absence-of-victims-body/articleshow/110475505.cms,"MUMBAI: Over six years after 28-year-old BBlunt salon executive Kirti Vyas went missing, a sessions court on Monday held two of her colleagues - Siddhesh Tamhankar and Kavita Sidhwani (name changed), in whose company she was last seen - guilty of her murder, making it a rare conviction in the absence of the victim's body .Special judge MG Deshpande said, ""The offence against both of you has been proved."" The judge will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Tuesday. While the maximum punishment is death, the minimum is life imprisonment. The trial was conducted in-camera at the behest of Sidhwani's lawyer to protect her identity.Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018, after leaving home for work. Tamhankar and Sidhwani were arrested on May 5 that year. A police inquiry found that the two strangled her in a car and dumped her body at Mahul. A prolonged search for the body did not yield results.The prosecution had said in court that Tamhankar had been afraid of losing his job after being put on notice by Vyas over his poor performance at work, and of his relationship with a married Sidhwani being exposed.Sidhwani (48), who had been granted bail by Supreme Court in 2021, broke down after the verdict and was taken into custody. Tamhankar (42), who has been in jail since his arrest in 2018, made repeated attempts to calm her down.IPS officer Sanjay Saxena, who was the then JCP (crime), credited the verdict despite the absence of the body to good teamwork. ""Strong circumstantial evidence coupled with scientific evidence through forensic analysis, was the key,"" he said.Calling the crime premeditated, special public prosecutor Avdhoot Chimalkar had cited the evidence of 39 witnesses to seek a conviction, and said, while submitting the final arguments in the case, that the crime was committed on the day the deadline mentioned on the show-cause notice ended, ""on which day, in all probability, his services were to be terminated"". He said Tamhankar and Sidhwani's residences, and their workplace, were far from Vyas's home and there was no other need for them to have waited for her outside her house on March 16, 2018.The prosecution said Tamhankar had accompanied Vyas's family when filing a missing person complaint and even joined a search for her. It said during none of these instances did Tamhankar reveal he and Sidhwani had picked Vyas up from outside her house - the most incriminating evidence against him. He revealed this out of fear only after CCTV footage was being scanned. It was also said DNA from the bloodstains and hair strands recovered from the car matched with Vyas' blood samples.","Kirti Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018, after leaving home for work.

Adani’s Mundra Port welcomes largest ever container ship to dock in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adanis-mundra-port-welcomes-largest-ever-container-ship-to-dock-in-india/articleshow/110443007.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adani Group ’s Mundra Port on Sunday saw the largest ever container ship to dock at an Indian port when the almost 400-metre-long MSC Anna came visiting. This vessel is a metre longer than the earlier biggest one — MV MSC Hamburg — that docked here last July.

“MSC Anna is an impressive vessel, boasting an overall length of 399.98 m (roughly the length of four football fields) and a staggering capacity of 19,200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), which makes it the largest container ship by capacity to ever visit an Indian port. Its arrival draft is 16.3 m, which can be accommodated only at Adani Ports, Mundra, as no other port in India is capable of berthing a deep-draft vessel. During its stay, the expected exchange is 12,500 TEUs,” Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said in a statement.

Last July 2023, Adani Ports, Mundra, had berthed the 399-metre-long MV MSC Hamburg, one of the longest container ships in the world, with a capacity of 16,652 TEUs. This had set the stage for the arrival of MSC Anna.

“The arrival of MSC Anna at Mundra not only highlights the port’s capacity to handle mega ships but also reflects its role in enhancing India’s maritime trade capabilities. As APSEZ continues to expand and upgrade its facilities, the port is set to play an increasingly significant role in the global shipping and logistics landscape,” the statement added.

"Monsoon to be above normal but no respite from heat yet, northwest India to see more heatwave days in June: IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-respite-yet-north-india-to-see-more-heatwave-days-imd/articleshow/110476171.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sticking to its April forecast, India Meteorological Department Monday predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall across the country in general, and over the monsoon core zone (which depends on rain-fed agriculture) in particular, during the June-Sept rainy season, giving a positive signal to the economy . There is a forecast probability of 61% for the country to get 'above normal' monsoon rainfall.However, most parts of northwest India will not get respite from the scorching heat in June even as there is a brief relief after three days due to western disturbances with IMD expecting a minimum four to six days of heatwave in the region next month. Many other parts of the country too will face normal to above normal maximum and minimum temperatures during the month.It may happen despite the normal onset of monsoon over Kerala as the possibility of its subsequent subdued progress, specifically towards northwest India, cannot be ruled out. The possibility of a rare phenomenon of the monsoon arriving in northeast India first before it hits Kerala is also not ruled out. IMD said conditions are likely to become favourable for monsoon onset over Kerala during next five days - it means monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to happen either on its normal date of arrival (June 1) or a day before.“Quantitatively, the southwest (summer) monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error of ± 4%,"" said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while releasing the second stage of long range monsoon forecast reflecting its spatial distribution.Accordingly, central India and south Peninsular India are most likely to get ‘above normal’ rainfall whereas northwest India may get ‘normal’ rainfall. There is, however, a concern for northeast India and eastern part of central India, including large parts of Odisha and certain parts of south West Bengal and Jharkhand, where there is a forecast of ‘below normal’ rainfall.“But the good news is that the monsoon core zone, consisting of most of the rainfed agriculture areas in the country, is most likely to get ‘above normal’ (>106% of LPA) rainfall. It’ll boost farming operations in the region,” said Mohapatra.Since good farming operations depend on fairly good distribution of rainfall across regions, the prediction of ‘above normal’ rainfall in the monsoon core zone that lacks adequate irrigation networks may not just boost the Kharif (summer sown) crops in summer but also contribute to enough moisture in the soil for good farming operation for Rabi (winter sown) crops. It’ll lead to high output of foodgrains, pushing rural demand and the overall economy during 2024-25.Though northwestern and central parts of India are likely to get some relief from the scorching heat after three days due to a western disturbance and moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea, a higher number of heatwave days are predicted in the region in June.“Normally, northwest India and the adjoining areas record two-three heatwave days in June. But this time, we expect four-six days of heatwave in this region,” said Mohapatra.",There is a forecast probability of 61% for the country to get 'above normal' monsoon rainfall.

The meeting has been called by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge .Sources said the meeting would focus on counting day, with instructions to be given to counting agents and booth agents on the various aspects to be taken care of, and on how to handle the returning officers' ""objectionable overreach"".Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announced that she would not attend the meeting, saying the state was still dealing with the aftermath of cyclone Remal and the final phase of polling was scheduled on June 1.While the reasons given by Banerjee are seen as understandable, many view it as the West Bengal CM positioning herself for the post-poll scenario. She struck an independent line during the polls by refusing to tie up with Congress in Bengal and then issuing statements that she would only extend outside support if INDIA bloc forms the govt. While she later revised her statement to say that TMC would join any opposition govt, she created doubts in the minds of many about her future plans.A senior TMC MP said it was ""impractical"" to expect the party to attend the meeting. ""CM Banerjee is a voter in Bhowanipore. She will vote on June 1. Party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is a candidate in Diamond Harbour, which goes to polls on June 1. The party's Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien is also a Kolkata South voter. These three were part of INDIA meetings earlier. Party's leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay is a Kolkata North candidate. We have conveyed this to Congress.""",The meeting has been called by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge.

However, KCR 's bid to trap BJP came unstuck as the matter reached Telangana HC, which transferred the case to CBI.Referring to KCR as ""peddayana"" (elder), Rao said in his confession that the then CM was upset the plan did not work out. ""Peddayana was angry for not completing the 'work' as per his expectation. I will not disclose further details as I owe a lot to Peddayana who had re-appointed me twice and posted me in the city task force after my retirement in 2020,"" he said. Rao disclosed that in Oct last year, then Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) chief T Prabhakar Rao told him that KCR was informed by then Tandur MLA Pilot Rohith Reddy that some persons claiming to be influential in BJP were in touch with him (Rohith Reddy) and were trying to convince him to join the saffron party after leaving BRS along with some other MLAs. At KCR's behest, SIB's (former) deputy SP D Praneeth Rao intercepted the phones of some private persons and the MLA, and submitted an audio clip, Rao revealed.

He allegedly asked three more MLAs to be part of the operation.The Tandur MLA (Rohith Reddy) enticed three persons to come to a farmhouse in Moinabad, the ex-DCP said. The trio was arrested for luring four BRS MLAs to join BJP. ""Later, an SIT was formed and KCR wanted to arrest BJP national leader Santhosh to make the case strong, so that BJP would agree to a compromise, and it could be used to get rid of the ED case against his daughter Kavitha,"" the confession report alleged.However, due to the inefficiency of some officials in Cyberabad police, a key person escaped from police custody, it added.A team of cops, led by SP-rank officer Rema Rajeshwari, took a chartered flight to Kerala, but failed to nab the wanted person, Rao mentioned. The poaching case later reached the Telangana high court, which stayed the arrest of the accused and handed over the probe to CBI in Dec 2022.","K Chandrasekhar Rao allegedly wanted to use 2022 MLA poaching case to force BJP to arrive at a compromise and, in turn, bail out his daughter and MLC K Kavitha in the Delhi liquor scam case.
