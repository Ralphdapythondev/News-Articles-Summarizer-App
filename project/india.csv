PM Modi heads back to India without handing MAGA supremo a 'trump card',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-heads-back-to-india-without-handing-maga-supremo-a-trump-card/articleshow/113617300.cms,"'Who's Next?': Awkward Moment For Biden As He Forgets Modi’s Name At Quad Summit | Watch

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi headed back home to India on Monday night after a hectic 72-hour visit to the US during which he steered clear of domestic American politics, including giving a wide berth to the two 2024 Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Modi's packed schedule, which included bilateral talks with outgoing President Joe Biden , a summit of Quad leaders , an address at the UN Summit of the Future, a community reception, and meeting with high-profile CEOs, left him little time to meet the candidates, both of whom have also been on the road electioneering.But a Trump teaser last week that Modi was coming to the US to meet him had triggered speculation about whether the MAGA supremo would turn up in NYC or at the diaspora event at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, where Trump himself had held a raucous rally a few days before.As it turned out, it was just some hot air from the MAGA poohbah, whose bloviating in recent months includes constant bragging about how world leaders respect him and seek him out. Apparently, some polite inquiries about his schedule from someone who desired to bring about a meeting may have been enough to assume Modi wanted a meeting.Trump is notorious for misreading or distorting conversations with world leaders. In a 2019 Oval Office meeting with then Pakistan PM Imran Khan, he claimed Modi had asked him to be a mediator or arbitrator in Kashmir, a claim New Delhi had to refute publicly.Despite the contretemps, or perhaps because of it, the Indian Prime Minister famously invited Trump for a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Houston in 2019, impressing him with a 50,000 people desi turnout. That in turn led Trump, who is freakily obsessed with crowd sizes, to begin his 2020 India visit with a ""Namaste Trump"" rally Modi hosted for him in Ahmedabad, where 100,000 people packed the newly build stadium named after Modi.While Trump talked up Modi ahead of his US visit on Friday, calling him a ""fantastic"" leader while holding out the prospect of a meeting, the Indian side evidently chose discretion after copping some criticism for the 2019 rally in which Modi laid it thick on Trump. He echoed the slogan ""Ab ki baar, Trump sarkar"" -- coined by Trump's Indian-American acolytes who see common virtues in them as strong, assertive leaders -- leading some commentators to conclude he was backing Trump for a second consecutive term in 2020.As it turned out, Trump lost the election to Joe Biden, and New Delhi had to reset engagement with the incoming Democratic dispensation that included a vice-president of part-Indian origin, whose desi creds are suspect in the eyes of the Indian right wing. In light of that experience, it appears the PM's brains trust chose to skirt around meeting either presidential candidate, with everyone's program busy enough to cite ""scheduling difficulties.""Although Indian-Americans have conventionally leaned towards Democrats, more recent surveys indicate that with increasing economic security and well-being, many are embracing the Republican Party. Trump in particular has a vocal Indian-American following from a pro-Modi constituency that hero-worships both.Trump was in fact speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night as Modi emplaned for New Delhi. Harris, who also has to juggle her job as vice-president while campaigning, was in Washington DC before she heads out to Pennsylvania, the most crucial among battleground states.","Narendra Modi headed back home to India on Monday night after a hectic 72-hour visit to the US.

Legal system acknowledges fallibility of judges: SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has said that judges are also fallible, and courts should not shy away from accepting mistakes in their orders and rectify them even after a case has been closed.Over a year after SC passed an interim order granting protection to Indiabulls Housing Finance and its officials, and stayed proceedings of debt recovery and in money laundering cases against them, the court admitted ""certain errors crept in its order by oversight"".The apparent mistake was that the restraint order was passed against Enforcement Directorate without granting a hearing to the agency, which sought modification of the order. The order, passed by Justice Krishna Murari and Justice Sanjay Kumar, had another flaw - it asked the parties to approach high court to raise their grievances, but at the same time granted interim protection that would continue during pendency of the case in HC.Normally, Supreme Court's protection remains in place till the parties have approached high court, with the apex court leaving it to HC to take a decision on interim protection.On Tuesday, a bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar and Justice Aravind Kumar acknowledged the twin errors and modified the order, saying the interim protection in recovery proceedings would be till the parties moved HC and then it would be for HC to decide on interim order.""The stay of proceedings granted by this court in the writ petition, in relation to the first three FIRs, was directed to continue till the disposal of the writ petitions to be filed before HCs. When a party is relegated to HC to pursue its remedies, it would not be proper, in the normal course, to bind the said HC with directions in relation to the proceedings to be impugned before such court. Ordinarily, this court would leave all issues open for the party so relegated to raise and pursue before HC,"" the bench said.""Being the court of last resort, this court would not shy away from acknowledging any mistakes in its orders and would be ready to set right such wrongs,"" the bench said, allowing ED's plea, and withdrew the part of the order relating to the money laundering case it had passed on July 4 last year.Referring to the SC judgment in V K Jain vs Delhi HC, the bench said, ""Our legal system acknowledges the fallibility of judges. Though this observation was made in the context of judges of the district judiciary, it would be equally applicable to those in higher echelons of the judicial hierarchy. As courts of record, it is necessary that constitutional courts recognise errors that may have crept into their judicial orders and rectify the same when called upon to do so.""Justice Krishna Murari had superannuated in the interregnum.","Supreme Court said that judges are also fallible, and courts should not shy away from accepting mistakes in their orders.

Delhi airport to get India's first air train by 2027 for seamless terminal connectivity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-airport-to-get-indias-first-air-train-by-2027-for-seamless-terminal-connectivity/articleshow/113614923.cms,"Transiting between Delhi Airport ’s Terminal 3 & T2 on one side and T1 on the other will finally be a breeze before the end of calendar year 2027. Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) has issued the tender to built an air train or automated people mover (APM) that will have four stops — T2/3, T1, Aerocity and cargo city . The GMR-backed DIAL has given the alignment for this 7.7-km route.Once ready, trudging by DTC buses between these two distant terminals from city side will be a thing of the past.Sources say the airport operator is likely to get bids for what will India’s first air train at an airport, in Oct and Nov. The winning bidder will be decided based on the cost quoted by different parties and whether they offer a revenue share model or seek viability gap funding for the project. “If all goes well, contract will be awarded before the end of this fiscal. Work will then begin and it is targeted to be over before end of CY 2027. That is what has been conveyed to the Union aviation ministry by DIAL,” say sources.The tender document says: “DIAL proposes to implement an elevated cum at-grade APM system at Delhi International Airport on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model. The APM system is intended to provide reliable, fast and seamless connectivity between T1 and T3/2 spanning route length of around 7.7 km via Aerocity and Cargo city. In addition to providing required connectivity between terminals, APM system will enhance passenger convenience, improve ASQ score and reduce carbon footprint.”The aviation ministry in Modi 2.0 had told DIAL it will not allow levy of any development fees to fund this project before the same is ready. While the cost of IGIA air train is not known as the same has been left for bidders to evaluate and quote accordingly, the same could be under Rs 2,000 crore, say sources.Govt had earlier also asked DIAL to drop its plan for six stops on the proposed air train as the same would have been “too long with higher connecting time between T1 and T2/3.”“DIAL’s model for having so many stops, including two at Aerocity, will not only mean higher travel time between T1 and T2/3 but also require foolproof security at the non terminal stops,” a senior Govt official had said last Nov when that plan was discussed.Delhi Airport — India’s busiest hub handles over 7 crore passengers annually at present and is doubling its capacity to over 13 crore within the next 6-8 years — desperately needs the air train. It is estimated 25% travellers at IGIA will be transit flyers , hence the need for ensuring seamless transfers between T1 and T3/2. There is no way these volumes can be handled without an air train between terminals.Air trains globally are free to use for passengers to ensure seamless transit between terminals. However, the cost of augmenting airport infra is recovered through two means — AERA deciding aeronautical charges for airlines like landing and parking fees who accordingly decide fares; and through UDF on passengers. The UDF charged at Mumbai Airport, for instance, used to have a metro component of Rs 20 and Rs 120 per domestic and international departure respectively. This was component was levied from 2016 to February 2023 to raise Rs 518 crore for metro connectivity and was stopped when that target sum was raised.",The GMR-backed DIAL has given the alignment for this 7.7-km route.

NEW DELHI: In a world where fast fashion reigns and the idea of repeating outfits is often met with disapproval, designer Rina Dhaka is championing a shift towards sustainability . Dhaka believes fashion doesn’t have to be disposable and that reusing clothes should be seen as stylish. “We need to make re-wearing outfits fashionable,” she urged.Speaking at an interactive session organised by FICCI-FLO on Tuesday, titled ""How to Be the Best Version of Yourself,"" Dhaka was one of seven panellists captivating the audience with her insights.What left the crowd particularly inspired was when she told them about the ‘ 30 Wears rule ’.The 30 Wears rule encourages consumers to ask themselves whether they would wear a particular piece of clothing at least 30 times before making a purchase. By doing so, it promotes more mindful shopping habits and helps reduce textile waste, advocating for a longer life cycle for each item of clothing. Dhaka's message was clear: sustainability and style can go hand in hand, and mindful fashion choices are the way forward.During the session, panelists touched on a variety of topics—from how improving posture can enhance one’s appearance to the importance of incorporating Indian textiles into everyday fashion.Another panelist, Nelofar Currimbhoy, daughter of beauty mogul Shahnaz Husain and a veteran of the industry, offered a fresh perspective on beauty, emphasising that it extends far beyond appearances. ""Beauty is a tool for cultivating self-worth,"" she shared, highlighting its deeper role in personal empowerment. ""It's not just women who are conscious of their looks—men are, too. But for women, dressing up can be an act of empowerment, a way to express confidence and strength.""Currimbhoy was quick to clarify, however, that beauty isn’t about spending hours in a salon. ""We’re not advocating that women should chase perfection with endless treatments. What matters most is authenticity.""Rina Dhaka echoed this sentiment, adding a modern-day twist. ""In an era where real faces are increasingly replaced by silicone, the focus should shift to grooming and hygiene, rather than chasing artificial ideals."" Dhaka’s words underscored the need for a return to simplicity—celebrating beauty that’s rooted in self-care and self-respect.For the session the panelists included fashion designers such as Leena Singh, Neenal Pratap Rudy, Rina Dhaka, and Nelofar Currimbhoy, Tanu Jain, Aditya Dhir from the jeweler industry, and Donna Masih, who is a Fashion Model and Fashion Lifestyle Influencer.Donna emphasised the powerful impact of good posture on enhancing one’s personality and presence. In today’s world, where we’re constantly glued to our phones, poor posture—especially a hunched neck—has become all too common. ""A strong posture speaks volumes,"" she explained. ""It’s essential for making a positive impression, particularly in first meetings or public interactions.""She went on to highlight how crucial first impressions can be, often setting the tone for success or failure. ""Your first impression can make or break a situation,"" Donna remarked. ""Sometimes, it’s not about what you say, but how you present yourself. Non-verbal cues, like posture, can make you seem approachable and open, encouraging others to engage in conversation."" Her advice was clear: standing tall not only boosts confidence but also opens doors to meaningful connections. The only male panelist among the group also gave some jewellery styling tips, saying now less is more.When an audience member at the event candidly asked for tips on how to look more camera-ready, the panelists eagerly offered their advice. Donna chimed in first, suggesting that side profiles and angled poses often work best on camera. ""A slight turn can make all the difference,"" she said, hinting at the magic of finding flattering angles.Nelofar Currimbhoy added her own expert tip, particularly for group photos. ""In a group shot, try stepping back from the others slightly,"" she advised. ""It creates a better perspective and can give you a more flattering angle in the frame."" Both panellists emphasised that small adjustments can dramatically improve how you present yourself on camera, making every shot count.As the session wrapped up, Leena and Rina treated the audience to live styling demonstrations, showing how a few layers and simple outfit choices can transform a look from ordinary to chic. Meanwhile, Donna took the stage to offer practical advice on perfecting body posture and enhancing overall presentation, reminding everyone that how you carry yourself is just as important as what you wear. Together, their demos provided a seamless blend of fashion and confidence tips, leaving the crowd inspired to elevate their style and presence.","FICCI-FLO held an interactive session on 'How to Be the Best Version of Yourself' Panelists included fashion designers Rina Dhaka, Neenal Pratap Rudy, Nelofar Currimbhoy, Tanu Jain and Aditya Dhir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113648549,imgsize-1518464,width-400,resizemode-4/113648549.jpg"
Supreme Court: Punjab's NRI quota criteria a 'fraud' on medical education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-punjabs-nri-quota-criteria-a-fraud-on-medical-education/articleshow/113648517.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday castigated Punjab's AAP govt for expanding the eligibility criteria for availing 15% NRI quota in admissions to state-run and private medical and dental colleges to include 'wards' of NRIs and termed this a ""fraud on the education system to mint money"".Taking exception to the last-minute expansion of criteria for NRI quota after the last day of submission of applications to include any near relative or ward of NRIs for admission to medical colleges, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra strongly criticised the Bhagwant Singh Mann-led govt for devising a ""money spinning"" mechanism.""Look at the expressions - 'nearest relatives' and 'wards' of NRIs. Anyone can be a nearest relative, even a third cousin. And what did the govt mean by ward of an NRI? Any and everyone can be termed a ward of an NRI, and the proof is just an affidavit by the person residing abroad,"" the bench said.Dismissing Punjab govt's appeal against high court's Sept 10 order quashing the new criteria, the apex court said, ""These are all backdoor entries, and this is nothing but a money-spinning device for the govt. It must stop.""Appearing for general category students who are to avail the vacant NRI quota seats, senior advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari said a general category student with 630 out of 700 marks would not get a seat but an NRI ward with just 200 marks could get admitted. ""In Punjab, it is not difficult to find an NRI,"" he said.The CJI said the Punjab and Haryana HC bench led by CJ Sheel Nagu had given the correct judgment by quashing the Aug 20 corrigendum to the medical admission prospectus and directing the state to complete the admissions as per the unamended prospectus which entitled only children of NRIs to take admission under the NRI quota.For Punjab, additional advocate general Shadan Farasat argued that the Aam Aadmi Party government had followed the same process that was being implemented for NRI quota admissions by Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Union govt.The CJI said, ""Let us put a lid on this whole fraud in the name of NRI quota seats. This expanded meaning of NRI quota is nothing but a fraud on the medical education system. After the last date of submission of application form, the Punjab government expands the NRI quota seat eligibility criteria. General category candidates having three times the marks of an NRI ward will lose out because of this. The court should not lend its authority to this patent fraud.""",Supreme Court castigated Punjab's AAP govt for expanding the eligibility criteria for availing 15% NRI quota in admissions to state-run and private medical and dental colleges.

Agencies blamed for negligence for Silkyara tunnel collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-probe-reveals-agencies-negligence/articleshow/113648356.cms,"Silkyara tunnel

NEW DELHI: The final probe report on last year’s Silkyara tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand has found negligence on part of the entity that prepared the detailed project report (DPR), construction firm, supervision consultant or authority engineer (AE), and National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL).It said the fixing of alignment did not meet basic principles of tunnelling, and there was negligence on part of the contractor to address the issue of 21 minor collapses, despite AE flagging them.Sources said the probe panel headed by former Border Road Organisation director general R K Dhiman submitted the report to the road transport ministry last week.Highlighting the lack of coordination and information flow among the stakeholders and how they overlooked responsibilities, the panel has recommended that the govt may initiate penal action against delinquent personnel and officers after carrying out an inquiry.“We will study and take necessary action,” a top ministry official said.TOI has learnt that probe found that the DPR was based on limited geological and geotechnical investigations, the alignment could have been modified to eliminate weak or shear zones, and no expert third party review was done, which was a deviation from normal practice.The report highlighted how the construction company did not conduct a proper investigation, and there were issues with design and execution.It has flagged incompetence of contractor, AE and approving authority NHIDCL, mentioning that evidence showed no measure was taken to address the shear zone issue.Shear zone refers to highly deformed, weak and thinned rocks due to high level of regional stress, and such zones require special attention, greater monitoring of ground behaviour and more support to avoid any mishap.As per the report, incorrect value of rock mass rating (RMR) was adopted to keep the rock mass classification as Class-IV instead of Class-V, which was the primary reason for several minor collapses.It said an adequate monitoring plan was not implemented due to which correct deformation details were not established. The deformations were not being addressed properly, which was one of the reasons for the massive collapse that resulted in 41 workers getting trapped for 17 days.The report has mentioned how reprofiling was carried out in distressed zones without ensuring the safety and safe passage of workers, and how the methodology for reprofiling was not vetted by AE. Senior geologist and material engineer, who play a key role in identifying geology and ensuring quality of work, were also absent during the last one year.For completion of the project, the panel has recommended clearing off debris in the collapsed section and conducting a detailed inspection of inaccessible sections of the tunnel for condition assessment. It has suggested immediate dewatering, and redesign and modification of the construction methodology to align geological conditions.","The final probe report on last year’s Silkyara tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand has found negligence on part of the entity that prepared the detailed project report.

India has invited Myanmar's rebel groups for meet: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-invited-myanmars-rebel-groups-for-meet-report/articleshow/113647905.cms,"It was not immediately clear if Myanmar’s military govt would also be invited to the event, to be hosted by govt-funded Indian Council of World Affairs whose council includes foreign minister Jaishankar.

India has invited political and military opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta to attend a seminar in New Delhi, sources said, a significant move by the South Asian power that has maintained ties with the top generals shunned by Western nations.A civil war in Myanmar since its military unseated an elected civilian govt in a Feb 2021 coup now risks destabilising India's 1,650-km border with Myanmar, and some of its key infrastructure projects there.A functionary of an armed group and two sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the parallel National Unity Govt (NUG) and ethnic minority rebels from the states of Chin, Rakhine and Kachin bordering India had been invited to a seminar in mid-Nov.The event would be hosted by govt-funded Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), whose council includes foreign minister S Jaishankar, said two other sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity..It was not immediately clear if Myanmar's military govt would also be invited to the event, which sources said would be on the topic of ""Constitutionalism and Federalism"". They gave no further details.Widespread protest in Myanmar over the 2021 coup turned into a nationwide rebellion, with an armed resistance movement combining with some established ethnic armies to seize control of wide swathes of territory from the military.The junta has refused to enter into dialogue with the rebels, whom it describes as ""terrorists"".Speaking of the seminar, Sui Khar, vice chairman of one of the ethnic rebel groups, Chin National Front, said, ""We are going to send representatives. This will be the first time, I think, formally, that India will engage with the non-state actors. This is a good, positive approach.""A spokesperson for Myanmar's military did not answer telephone calls to seek comment. Indian govt and ICWA did not respond to requests for comment.The other armed groups invited include Arakan Army, which controls significant reaches of territory in Rakhine bordering Bangladesh, and Kachin Independence Army (KIA), one of Myanmar's most powerful rebel forces, sources added.A spokesperson for president of the shadow NUG govt declined to comment on the seminar. Arakan Army and KIA did not respond to requests for comment.Although the junta has been condemned by Western powers, with most of them having imposed sanctions, India has kept up engagement with the generals through visits to the capital, Naypyitaw, by its govt and defence officials.India has been reluctant to openly criticise the junta, which could push the generals closer to rival China. New Delhi has had no formal engagement with the junta's opponents.It was not immediately clear what the seminar would seek to achieve or why India has made the move.In June, Jaishankar voiced concern about border instability and security risks to India's projects in Myanmar. India was ""open to engaging all stakeholders in addressing this situation,"" he told his Myanmar counterpart.India is involved in developing the $400-million Kaladan port and highway project in Myanmar's west, as well as providing about $250 million for another road project to link its landlocked northeastern states with Thailand, via Myanmar.The seminar plan comes amid a peace effort by Asean grouping of Southeast Asian nations that has made scant progress since its unveiling in April 2021, as some Asean nations have been vexed by the junta's refusal of talks.Last year, former Asean chair Indonesia said it had received positive signals about preliminary dialogue from major parties in the conflict, but there have been no signs advancement yet.The Nov meeting would represent New Delhi's serious effort to approach Myanmar's ""pro-democracy side"" since the 2021 coup, said Angshuman Choudhury, a Singapore-based researcher who closely tracks India-Myanmar affairs.""We also need to see ... whether it is meant to achieve specific foreign policy outcomes or simply relay a signal to Myanmar military to step back,"" he said.","India has invited political and military opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta to attend a seminar in New Delhi, sources said. It is a significant move by the South Asian power that has maintained ties with the top generals shunned by Western nations. A civil war in Myanmar since its military unseated an elected civilian govt in a Feb 2021 coup now risks destabilising India's 1,650-km border.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113647907,imgsize-72790,width-400,resizemode-4/113647907.jpg"
India-China relationship key to future: S Jaishankar in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-relationship-key-to-future-s-jaishankar/articleshow/113647713.cms,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said that India and China have had a ""difficult history"" adding that the two country's relationship was ""key"" to the future of Asia and said that it was crucial as it would bring multipolarity to the continent and to the world.""We have a difficult history with China...Despite the explicit agreements we had with China, we saw in the middle of Covid that the Chinese moved a large number of forces in violation of these agreements to the line of actual control (LAC).It was likely a mishap would happen, and it did. So, there was a clash, and a number of troops died on either side. That, in a sense, overshadowed the relationship,"" Jaishankar said addressing the Asia Society at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.""When I said 75% of it has been sorted out, it's only of the disengagement. So, that's one part of the problem, he added."" I think the India - China relationship is key to the future of Asia. If the world is to be multipolar, Asia has to be multipolar and therefore this relationship will influence not just the future of Asia, but in that way, perhaps the future of the world as well,"" he said.Jaishankar said that the commencement of Indo-Pacific as a strategic subject had led to the success of 'Act East Policy.'""We have long pursued the 'Act East Policy' with Asean at its centre. In the last decade, we have seen it mature into something beyond Asean. The arrival of the Indo-Pacific as a strategic subject is the success of the Act East Policy.""He also talked about India's relationship with Gulf and middle eastern countries.""India's ties with the Gulf have dramatically changed in the last decade,"" he said.Pointing out the connectivity proposals between the two countries, he said, ""Most notably the IMEC, the India - Middle East - Europe economic corridor. It connects the Atlantic to India and we are in turn trying to also build connectivity to the Pacific through Myanmar which is called the Trilateral Highway. It is conceivable by the end of the decade. We could primarily have land-based connectivity all the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific which runs through Asia...""Earlier, he met with his counterparts from France, Panama, and Malta, discussing regional issues and ways to strengthen bilateral relations. He is currently in the US to speak at the General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly on September 28.","Foreign minister S Jaishankar said that India and China have had a ""difficult history"" He said that the two country's relationship was ""key"" to the future of Asia and said that it was crucial as it would bring multipolarity to the continent and to the world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113647797,imgsize-333248,width-400,resizemode-4/113647797.jpg"
