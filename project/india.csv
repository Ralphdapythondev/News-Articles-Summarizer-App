"EC halts appointment of Army Colonel as J&K SSP during MCC, seeks compliance report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-halts-appointment-of-army-colonel-as-jk-ssp-during-mcc-seeks-compliance-report/articleshow/113832849.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Monday stalled the appointment of an Army Colonel as the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in charge of training and special operations in J&K police, despite a restraint on transfer of all poll-related officers during the model code of conduct ( MCC ) period.Directing that the transfer of Vikrant Prasher of Indian Army's Para, High Altitude Warfare School, Gulmarg, as SSP be kept in abeyance with immediate effect and if already implemented, the status quo ante be restored, EC sought an explanation from the J&K chief secretary regarding the rationale for issuing the order without securing its prior clearance, as required under MCC.The chief secretary was asked to send a compliance report, along with the aforesaid explanation, to the EC by 11 am on Tuesday.The J&K administration had on September 27 appointed Col Prasher as SSP (Training) and Special (Ops) in J&K Police.Though this is perhaps the first time an Army officer has been posted as an SSP in J&K police, there has been a precedent of BSF officer Raja Aijaz Ali having headed the communications unit of J&K police. Also, there are precedents of Army officials having led Andhra Pradesh’s special anti-Naxal force Greyhounds, besides being drafted into special, expertise-based roles in West Bengal and Odisha police. “The expertise of military and para-military officers in roles like jungle warfare and mountain warfare is often used by the civilian police by taking in their senior officers and getting them to impart their skills to other police officers. Having an expert from the Army’s Para High Altitude Warfare School as an SSP in charge of training J&K police in mountain warfare will help them deal with terrorists that have recently made bases in the mountain tops of Jammu region,” said a senior J&K police officer told TOI.“When we can get foreign coaches to train our sportspersons, here we are only drafting the best officers from our own military and para-military forces, who closely work with us in counter-terror operations, to train the civilian police,” said the officer.In its letter sent to the J&K chief secretary on Monday, the EC had observed: “The model code of conduct is in force in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir and as such there is a ban on transfer of officers connected to election is in force. Without going into the rationale at this stage, process and urgency of posting of an Army officer as SSP in the civil side during the period of operation of MCC, the Commission hereby directs that order shall be kept in abeyance with immediate effect. If the order has already been implemented, the status quo prior to the issuance of the order must be restored immediately.”The J&K administration had on September 27 appointed Col Prasher as SSP (Training) and Special (Ops) in J&K Police.The third and conclusive phase of polling in the Union territory will be held on Tuesday. Counting for both J&K and Haryana, where polling is due on October 4, will be held on October 8.",The Election Commission on Monday stalled the appointment of an Army Colonel as the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in J&K police.

Earth gets a ‘mini moon’ for 2 months and it has a Mahabharata connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/earth-gets-a-mini-moon-for-2-months-and-it-has-a-mahabharata-connection/articleshow/113791435.cms,"An illustration for visual representation of asteroid trajectory

This ‘mini-moon’ is actually an asteroid — named ‘2024 PT5’ — which is about the size of a school bus. When it whizzed past Earth on Sunday (Sept 29), it would be temporarily pulled by our planet’s gravity. However, the Earth’s double delight of possessing two ‘Moons’ will be short-lived as the asteroid will revolve around the Earth only for 57 days.The asteroid will jettison the Earth’s gravity and disappear into deep space by late November.The ‘2024 PT 5’ was discovered on August 7, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), an automated system funded by the US space agency Nasa and run from Hawaii. The system is used to monitor near-Earth asteroids.In a report published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS), astronomers say the orbital properties of 2024 PT5 resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt, ‘a sparsely resonant population of small Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).’Dr Anil Kumar, head of Isro's Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA), which is also keeping a close watch on the asteroid, has also confirmed that the ‘ mini moon ’ is part of the Arjuna Asteroid grouping. The grouping was named in honour of Arjuna, a central character in epic Mahabharata, who was known for his archery skills and bravery. Like the swift arrows of Arjuna, the name reflects both the asteroid’s swift movement through the solar system and its unpredictable nature.The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km, making it too small to detect without specialised equipment.Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos, two scientists who reported it, said, “NEOs that follow horseshoe paths, and approach our planet at close range and low relative velocity, may undergo mini-moon events in which their geocentric energy becomes negative for hours, days or months, but without completing one revolution around Earth"".Marcos said this is not the first time mini Moons appear around the Earth. It happened in 1997, 2013 and 2018, a report said.On Nov 25, asteroid ‘2024 PT5’ will part ways with the Earth and continue its solo trajectory in cosmos. It's expected to pass by Earth again in 2055.","The asteroid, measuring just 10 meters in diameter, is 350,000 times smaller than Earth’s regular Moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 km.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday spoke to Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu amid Israel 's unabated aerial action against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.Sharing his conversation with Israel's Netanyahu, PM Modi said "" terrorism has no place in our world"".""Spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu about recent developments in West Asia . Terrorism has no place in our world.It is crucial to prevent regional escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages. India is committed to supporting efforts for an early restoration of peace and stability,"" PM Modi wrote on X.PM Modi has spoken to Netanyahu several times and expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East ever since last year's October 7 attack that saw Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas entering Israel's southern territory and killing hundreds of Israelis, besides injuring thousands and abducting over 250 people to keep them hostage for future negotiations.This conversation comes at a time when the situation in West Asia has descended to its all-time-low in recent years with Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's killing.Netanyahu called the death of Nasrallah ""the knockout punch"" to the ""main engine of Iran ’s axis of evil,"" referring to the network of Iranian-backed militias spread across the Middle East.For Israel, Nasrallah's death is seen as a defining moment. Hezbollah, with its vast arsenal of missiles and deep ties to Iran, had long been one of the most significant threats facing Israel.For decades, the group's military might and deep entrenchment in Lebanon's political system made it a formidable adversary.Nasrallah's death now leaves a power vacuum in both Hezbollah and the wider network of Iranian-backed militias across the region. From Gaza's Hamas to Yemen's Houthis, these groups have relied on Hezbollah's military expertise and leadership in their resistance against Israel and other regional powers.The potential disruption to this network could significantly weaken Iran's influence, reshuffling the region's balance of power.","PM Modi has spoken to Netanyahu several times and expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East.

NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh Congress minister Vikramaditya Singh , who was at the centre of a controversy over his diktat for mandatory use of nameplates by eateries in the state on the lines of Uttar Pradesh, on Monday reiterated his commitment to the Congress ideology but also asserted that protecting the interest of people of Himachal was as important as implementing the directives of the party high command.Vikramaditya strongly denied reports that he was summoned by the party high command over the issue and said he met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and party general secretary K C Venugopal during a prescheduled visit to the national capital.The PWD and urban development minister invoked his father late Virbhadra Singh to justify his stand and reiterated why registration of vendors was important. ""I cleared my position and told the party leadership that I stand with them like a rock and their directives will be followed. But I also told them that protecting the interest of 70 lakh people of Himachal Pradesh is also my duty and responsibility. My father was chief minister for 6 terms and he could achieve this feat because he strongly raised the voice of Himachal. Just like implementing the directives of the party leadership is important, ensuring the interests of the state is equally important,"" the Congress minister said. His remarks seemed to suggest that the two objectives were at variance to each other despite a Congress government in the state.""The question is only about registration of vendors keeping in mind the internal security situation and respecting the issues and sentiments of the locals. The move is to ensure that the food served is clean and there is no adulteration of any kind, to ensure that law and order is maintained and if some one is up to any mischief he can be identified and dealt with by the authorities. It is unfortunate that this was given a communal colur and was linked with the policies of any other state. The issues of Himachal Pradesh are different,"" Vikramaditya Singh said justifying his announcement which led to a huge row.Interestingly, Pratibha Singh, who is the state BJP chief and mother of Vikramaditya Singh, had also endorsed identification of ""outsiders"" for the sake of state security but had said she did not subscribe to BJP's ideology or its style of working. ""Identification of outsiders should be done to know the purpose of visit in view of the internal security of the state,"" she had said and claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion by media.The vendor policy issue is not the first time that Vikramaditya Singh had made comments diverging from party line. On the issue of Waqf Board amendements, which the Congress has opposed strongly, the Himachal minister had asserted that changes are necessary with times and had said: ""For the best interests of Himachal and its people, it is essential to bring about reforms.""(With inputs from agencies)",Vikramaditya Singh was at the centre of a controversy over his diktat for mandatory use of nameplates by eateries in the state.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court used extraordinary power on Monday and directed IIT Dhanbad to grant admission to a Dalit youth who lost his seat after missing the deadline to deposit fees.The court was hearing the case of an 18-year-old student Atul Kumar who lost his hard-earned seat in IIT Dhanbad after he narrowly missed the deadline to deposit Rs 17,500 as an acceptance fee after clearing the prestigious exam in his last attempt.The Supreme Court exercised its power under Article 142 and directed that the petitioner, who cracked IIT Dhanbad but could not get admission since he missed the fee payment deadline, must be granted admission to the institute.The Supreme Court said, ""A talented student like the petitioner who belongs to a marginalised group should not be left out for admission. The log-in details indicate that he was diligent to log into the portal ... there was no considerable reason why the petitioner would have done so if he didn't have the fees to pay ... we are of the view that a talented student should not be left in the lurch. We direct that admission be granted to IIT Dhanbad.""The court further noted that the last date to deposit fees was till 5pm on June 24.""The parents arranged the funds by 4.45pm, the petitioner states he was logged in at 4.45 pm at the portal, the portal was closed at 5 and payment was not processed,"" the SC observed.The top court also observed that the petitioner was allotted a seat in IIT Dhanbad and that this was his last chance to secure admission, since only two attempts are permissible.The top court further stated that the petitioner was a ""bright student"" and ""the only thing that stopped him was Rs 17,500"".""He should be admitted in the same batch ... a supernumerary seat be created for petitioner, no existing student shall be disturbed in the process,"" the SC directed.As the hearing concluded, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud told the petitioner: ""All the best!(do well)!""After the hearing, petitioner, Atul Kumar said, ""My life is now back on track...The CJI did great, he said that financial constraints should not pose a hurdle in one's progress. He said that I have a bright future and it should not be impacted.""","The Supreme Court used extraordinary power on Monday and directed IIT Dhanbad to grant admission to a Dalit youth.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a money-laundering case against Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah , linked to the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). The ED’s action comes in response to a state Lokayukta FIR , registered last week, that accuses the CM and others of irregularities in the allotment of land by the authority.Siddaramaiah’s wife BM Parvathi, his brother-in-law Mallikarjuna Swamy, and Devaraju, the individual from whom Swamy purchased land before gifting it to Parvathi, are also named in the FIR.The case, filed by the Lokayukta police on September 27, was ordered by a Bengaluru special court. The court’s decision came a day after the Karnataka High Court upheld Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot’s sanction to investigate Siddaramaiah over the allegations.The ED has registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), similar to a police FIR, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This allows the agency to summon the accused for questioning and potentially seize their assets during the investigation.Siddaramaiah, 76, has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, he said the case was politically motivated , alleging that the opposition was ""scared"" of him. He emphasized, “This is the first such political case against me,” adding that he has no intention of resigning and plans to fight the case legally.The controversy revolves around accusations that compensatory plots were allocated to Siddaramaiah’s wife in an upscale Mysuru area. The property is allegedly more valuable than the land MUDA originally acquired from her.The Lokayukta FIR has been registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) like 120B (criminal conspiracy), 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 426 (mischief), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 340 (wrongful confinement) and 351 (assault).","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a money-laundering case against Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

'Rahul Gandhi machine of telling lies'

Quota for Haryana Agniveers

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, upped the ante on Monday over the Agnipath scheme by launching a scathing attack at the ruling BJP in poll-bound Haryana Addressing a roadshow in Haryana's Ambala, Rahul Gandhi vehemently criticised the BJP for rolling out the Agnipath scheme which the Congress scion said would ""strip"" the Agniveers (candidates enrolled under Agnipath scheme) of pension only to ""benefit"" industrialist Gautam Adani Rahul Gandhi said Agniveers ""should not be in misconception"" as the scheme is only the mechanism to ""steal away"" their pension.""Normal jawan will be entitled to pension for all his life....but those with Agniveer tag will not get pension...which means money has been snatched from Agniveer's pocket...it has gone to Adani's pocket,"" said the Congress leader, who led party's ""Vijay Sankalp Yatra"" in Ambala.He further said: ""Agniveer has been rolled out to help Adani. Agniveer's truth is that Narendra Modiji wants to snatch pension from India's army men"".Stepping up his attack on PM Modi-led central government, the Rae Bareli MP said the government ""intends"" to ""snatch away pension, future and martyr status"" from Agniveers.While this is not the first time when Rahul Gandhi chose to corner the BJP over the Agnipath scheme, the BJP has promised government jobs with pensions to Haryana youths joining the armed forces through the Agnipath scheme.""Join the forces with passion. Haryana and the Indian government will give jobs with a pension to all the Agniveers of Haryana,"" the Union home minister Amit Shah said a few days ago in Rewari, asserting ""Pakki pension wali sarkari naukri (government jobs with pension)"".On September 29, Union Amit Shah while addressing public in Haryana's Badshahpur, again attacked Rahul Gandhi, calling him a ""machine of telling lies"".""Rahul Gandhi is a machine of telling lies. He says that the government has come up with the Agniveer scheme so that the youth do not have to be given pension. But the reality is that the Agniveer scheme has been made to keep our army young,"" Amit Shah said.The Union home minister further said: ""I want to tell the mothers and sisters that do not hesitate at all while sending your children to the army, the Haryana government and the government of India will provide a pensionable job to every Agniveer of Haryana"".Earlier on September 23, Amit Shah also accused Rahul of ""misleading the youth regarding the Agnipath scheme and said, ""About Agniveer, Rahul Baba is misguiding the youths. I am firm in what I say, and today I am saying that none of the Agniveer of Haryana will be left (without jobs with pensions).""In July, CM Nayab Singh Saini-led Haryana government announced a 10 per cent reservation for Agniveers in certain government jobs.CM Saini said the state government will provide 10 percent horizontal (lateral) reservation to Agniveers in Haryana in direct recruitment to the posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.Besides job reservations, the state government has decided to give Agniveers three to five years of age relaxation and interest-free loans of up to Rs 5 lakh for self-employment.","Rahul Gandhi launches scathing attack at the ruling BJP in poll-bound Haryana.

Why a scientific paper on adverse events in Covid vaccination was withdrawn post-publication,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-a-scientific-paper-on-adverse-events-in-covid-vaccination-was-withdrawn-post-publication/articleshow/113823634.cms,"Representative photo

Why did the journal editor lose confidence in the conclusions of the article?

Why did the study create controversy when it was published?

Why did ICMR want the paper retracted?

Why did Bharat Biotech file a defamation case against the authors of the paper?

What were the objections raised by researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members supporting the study authors?

The study titled “Long-term safety analysis of the BBV152 coronavirus vaccine in adolescents and adults: findings from a 1-year prospective study in north India,” which was published in May 2024 in the journal Drug Safety, was retracted and removed on September 24. Announcing the retraction, the journal editor stated that the article was being retracted “as he no longer has confidence in the conclusions as stated in the article.” Several researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members wrote an open letter condemning this decision, saying it would have “a chilling effect on researchers and is harmful to science and the trust people have in the institution of science.”According to the retraction notice, a post-publication review concluded that the reported adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were presented in a way that could lead to ambiguous or incorrect interpretations regarding the relationship with the BBV152 vaccine, popularly known as Covaxin.The notice added that, given these findings, the editor and the publisher, Springer Publishing Company, decided that the article “should be removed on public health grounds.” It stated that the authors disagreed with the retraction. Incidentally, the published study had been cleared by the journal’s editor and peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers. It had been published after incorporating the revisions suggested by the peer reviewers and the editor. Questions to the editor about whether the post-publication review had been shared with the authors, as mandated by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines, and whether they were given a chance to respond to the concerns raised in the review, went unanswered. There was also no response on how exactly public health was affected by the study. The journal decided to retract and remove the article even before a decision was made on the court case filed by Bharat Biotech India Ltd. (BBIL), the manufacturers of the vaccine, against the authors and the journal editor.When the study was published, there was significant media coverage, with most headlines stating that one-third of the study participants who took the vaccine reported adverse events. The paper also stated that only 1% of participants developed serious AESIs. However, AESIs are defined by the WHO as pre-specified medically significant events that have the potential to be causally associated with a vaccine and need to be carefully monitored and confirmed by further special studies. Clearly, AESIs after vaccination cannot be categorically said to be caused by the vaccine. There is only a probability that they could be “causally associated” with the vaccine and need to be studied further. Many pointed out several flaws in the study design, while some felt that parts of the discussion in the paper could be misleading. The media frenzy around it drew a sharp reaction from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR ), which, within a few days of the study’s publication, sent a letter to the journal editor and the authors, raising several objections and seeking its retraction.Most of the objections to the study, including those raised by ICMR, were already recorded and explained by the authors in the limitations section of the study. ICMR strongly objected to being acknowledged “for research support,” stating that it was not associated with the study nor had it provided any financial or technical support for the research. The council added that the acknowledgment was “without any prior approval or intimation to ICMR,” which was “inappropriate and unacceptable.” Although the authors explained why they had acknowledged ICMR, they subsequently asked for all acknowledgments to be removed, as the journal objected to the fact that they did not have written permission from ICMR to acknowledge the institution. Incidentally, while ICMR objected to the use of telephonic interviews for data collection in the study, it did not mention that BBIL had also conducted a safety study with just 176 participants (aged 15-18 years), using telephonic interviews to collect data on adverse events seven days after vaccination. ICMR also did not disclose in the letter its own conflict of interest as a co-developer of the vaccine with BBIL, from which it earned about Rs 172 crore in royalty. A group of epidemiologists, doctors, and public health experts criticized ICMR for “academic censorship” instead of building on the study and addressing its shortcomings to elevate the standards of vaccine safety . The group urged ICMR to seek publication of the long-term follow-up of phase-3 trials, which is yet to be published by Bharat Biotech.Bharat Biotech claimed in its petition that the research was conducted at the instance of its competitors, without providing any proof for this allegation. It claimed that “the study created shock, alarm, and hesitancy in the minds of the public regarding the quality and efficacy” of the vaccine, even though the Covid vaccination program had ended long before the study was published in May 2024. Moreover, the study was on AESIs, which are not necessarily causally related to a vaccine. It only emphasized the need for confirmation from future studies. The company claimed that the study had negatively affected its business and that it had lost out on contracts for the supply of the vaccine because of the defamatory study. The company sought Rs 5 crore in damages for loss of business and defamation. However, the export of Covaxin had been halted since April 2022 after the WHO raised unspecified concerns about its manufacturing following an inspection of the production facilities in Hyderabad. The company stopped producing Covaxin after the first quarter of 2023, long before the study was published, due to a lack of demand. In their affidavit in court, the authors pointed out that the company ought to have sent its objections to the journal and sought a debate and discussion on the methodology and findings of the study within scientific forums instead of sending their comments to the media and filing a case against them.The letter pointed out that, like most research studies, this one had various limitations, which the authors had acknowledged in the paper. The study showed that 99% of people did not have any serious events, which could have been used by the government to bolster people’s trust in the vaccine. The letter added that ICMR ought to have set up follow-up studies to examine the causal relationship between any reported adverse events and the vaccine. According to the letter, several media reports misinterpreted the study, suggesting that the vaccine caused side effects in one-third of the individuals, even though no such claims could be made from the study because it was not designed to examine a causal link between the vaccine and the adverse events. “The actions of ICMR and BBIL are short-sighted and punitive. Scientific disagreements have to be articulated as counterpoints in scientific fora. Forcing the journal to retract the paper or filing a Rs 5 crore defamation suit leads to a chilling effect on researchers and is harmful to science and the trust people have in the institution of science,” the letter stated. It called for “a mature, open-minded, and more confident response” from ICMR and demanded that the lawsuit be withdrawn and the paper reinstated in the journal.","The study titled “Long-term safety analysis of the BBV152 coronavirus vaccine in adolescents and adults: findings from a 1-year prospective study in north India” was retracted and removed on September 24. Several researchers, doctors, ethicists, scientists, and civil society members wrote an open letter condemning this decision.

The visit will be an important occasion for India to reaffirm its commitment to development support for the strategically located Indian Ocean neighbour amid concerns over a realignment in its foreign policy under the Marxist president.Jaishankar will also call on the president during what will also be the first visit by any foreign minister to Sri Lanka after the presidential election.India’s high commissioner to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha was the first foreign diplomat to call on Dissanayake after the election outcome was announced.With the visit by Jaishankar, which is expected to commence on October 4, the Indian government will also hope to build on its outreach to Dissanayake in the past 12 months that saw him visiting Delhi earlier this year, setting aside reservations over his party JVP’s (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) deep and longstanding resentment against India. During his visit, Dissanayake had met both Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval.“Dissanayake may not have been India’s first choice but the visit by Jaishankar in only the second week of his presidency suggests India doesn’t expect him to be hostile in the manner the new Maldives president was initially or the way the interim government in Bangladesh has been,’’ said a source speaking on condition of anonymity.While it took 6 months for the first high-level bilateral visit from either country in the case of the Maldives after the new president, Mohamed Muizzu, took over last year, India and Bangladesh are yet to see any bilateral visit since the ouster of former pro-India PM Sheikh Hasina in early August.In his meetings with Indian officials, Dissanayake is said to have been appreciative of India’s $ 4 billion-worth assistance that helped bail Sri Lanka out of a financial crisis. While there are concerns about what sort of relationship Dissanayake might pursue with China, his assurance before he became president that he won’t allow Sri Lanka’s land, sea and airspace to be used against India has been received well here. His threat to scrap Adani’s wind power project during the election campaign is also attributed more to ecological reasons than any political agenda. Dissanayake, who has called for a snap parliamentary poll to consolidate his hold over power, has said that views both India and China as valued partners and that he doesn’t want Sri Lanka to get involved in any ``geopolitical fight’’.``His anti-corruption focus helps India which believes in transparent infrastructure development, responsible debt financing practices, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law and the environment,’’ added the source.",Jaishankar will also call on the president during what will also be the first visit by any foreign minister to Sri Lanka after the presidential election.

NEW DELHI: Amid the threat of a wider regional conflict in West Asia following the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah by Israel, PM Modi spoke on Monday to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu expressing solidarity on the issue of terrorism while also underlining the need to prevent regional escalation. Modi said there's no place for terrorism in the world.The PM also underscored India's commitment to supporting peace efforts.He had last week also met Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas on the margins of UNGA and expressed deep concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza .While meeting Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas on the margins of UNGA last week, PM Modi reaffirmed India’s continued support to the people of Palestine.“Spoke to PM Netanyahu about recent developments in West Asia. Terrorism has no place in our world. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages. India is committed to supporting efforts for an early restoration of peace and stability,” said Modi on X.The killing of Nasrallah has sparked fears of a full-fledged war between Israel and Iran, and of plunging the entire region into conflict. Given India’s energy interests, a nine-million strong diaspora in the Gulf region and ongoing efforts to get the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) initiative going, it’s important for India that peace is restored at the earliest. Govt, however, while calling upon Israel to follow international humanitarian law and seeking and end to civilian deaths, has maintained there can be no justification for terrorism and has repeatedly condemned the Oct 7 Hamas terrorist attacks.Israeli strikes in Lebanon last week killed seven high-ranking commanders and officials from the Hezbollah militant group, including its leader Nasrallah.The situation seems to have taken a turn for the worse with Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowing Nasrallah’s death “will not be in vain”, and first Vice-President Mohammad Reza Aref saying it would bring about Israel’s “destruction”.",PM Modi spoke on Monday to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu.

fears made BJP re-strategise

GURGAON: This assembly election in Haryana, BJP's posters speak louder than any campaign speech.After 10 years in office in the state, the party does not have Manohar Lal Khattar , who served as CM for almost the entire period before BJP replaced him with Nayab Singh Saini this March and moved him to the Centre as Union minister for housing and urban affairs, on its posters.It has gone with Saini's face alongside a slightly larger one of Modi, but both are mugshots that sit in a corner of the posters, a conspicuous departure from BJP campaigns in the state and nationally since 2014 in which Modi's face would be the centrepiece. This time the face of the aam aadmi dominates posters.On BJP posters both on billboards and online, instead, are faces of common woman and man. Students, young entrepreneurs, women and even farmers, all promoting govt initiatives, its highway projects, startup policies, etc.One poster, featuring a farmer, says, “Yeh hai highway se dooriyan kam karne wali sarkar (This is a govt that bought the highways closer to us)”. Another, with a woman’s face on it, says, “Yeh hai startup ko support karne wali sarkar (This is a govt that supports startups)”It’s evident that the party — seen to be facing anti-incumbency headwinds and dropping from all 10 LS seats to 5 in the April-May general elections — sees strength in govt schemes. Since Lok Sabha polls, in which BJP fell short of the majority and formed a coalition govt, Haryana and J&K are the first major elections. While state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli could not be reached, party insiders said it was compelled to re-strategise to reduce the impact of anti-incumbency in the elections.In March, BJP effected a change of guard just before Lok Sabha polls by bringing in Kurukshetra MP and state unit chief Saini. The Saini govt has since gone on a welfarist push. One of the first things it did was to launch ‘Happy (Haryana Antyodaya Parivar Parivahan Yojana) card’, offering free bus rides up to 1,000km a year to members of families with an annual income up to Rs 1 lakh. “Yeh hai humein muft bus yatra karane wali sarkar (This is a govt that has given us free bus rides),” proclaims a poster advertising the scheme, the biggest faces on it is that of a family.“We understand that after being in office for 10 years, some amount of anti-incumbency has set in, and thus, there was a need to replace the CM face and change our strategy. Our ground reports backed up this assessment,” said a senior BJP functionary, when asked about its thought behind the posters. New schemes BJP has proposed have also found prominence in the campaign, like Lado Lakshmi (Rs 2,100 for women in BPL families) and an Olympic Games nursery in every district.Rao Narbir Singh, who was a minister in the first Khattar govt and is contesting from Gurgaon’s Badshapur this time to try and win back the seat he lost in 2019, has been praising Saini in his speeches but makes no mention of his former boss Khattar. Asked about the posters, he was candid. “Whatever development work was done, at least in Gurgaon, it happened from 2014-2019. After this, not even a foundation stone for a community centre was laid. This is probably why the faces on the poster are of the common man,” he said.","After 10 years in office in the state, the party does not have Manohar Lal Khattar on its posters.
