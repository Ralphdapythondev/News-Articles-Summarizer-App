Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

Political reaction

NEW DELHI: A disturbing video has surfaced on social media, showing a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.The assault, captured in the video, showed the woman being repeatedly struck until she was barely conscious and unable to resist. Shockingly, onlookers present at the scene do not intervene to help the victims.The video, shared widely on social media platforms, drew condemnation from political figures including BJP's Amit Malviya and CPI(M)'s Mohammed Salim.They criticized the safety of women under the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal , identifying the assailant as a local TMC leader nicknamed 'JCB' allegedly named Tajemul by the CPI(M) state secretary.Following the brutal assault on the woman, Tajemul is also seen in the video assaulting another man who was lying on the ground. Some people from the crowd reportedly assisted in making the man kneel so that Tajemul could continue his attack.Reports suggest that the incident occurred during an 'Insaf Sabha' organized by Tajemul, reminiscent of a Taliban-style 'quick justice' forum. The meeting allegedly convened to address allegations of an extramarital affair involving the victims, who were also fined as part of the so-called arbitration.Local sources cited by TV9 Bangla identified the woman as a married resident of the village, accused of having an extramarital affair with the man assaulted alongside her. The victims reportedly did not receive immediate medical attention after the assault.West Bengal Police have taken action in the case. Islampur Police Superintendent Joby Thomas K confirmed PTI that the police have registered a case upon verifying the video circulating on social media.""We have initiated raids to apprehend the perpetrator and are swiftly investigating the motive behind this reprehensible act,"" Joby Thomas K said.The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties BJP and CPI(M) accusing the TMC of orchestrating what they describe as ""bulldozer justice"" under chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's administration.BJP's social media head Malviya condemned the incident, highlighting broader concerns about law and order under the TMC regime.He said, “India must wake up to the reality of Sharia Courts in TMC run West Bengal. There is a Sandeshkhali in every village and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a curse for women. There is no semblance of law and order in Bengal. Will Mamata Banerjee act against this monster or defend him like she stood up for Sheikh Shahjahan?”He called on the National Commission for Women (NCW) to intervene and criticized Mamata Banerjee for what he described as systemic issues of governance in West Bengal.CPI(M) West Bengal state secretary Mohammed Salim echoed these sentiments, criticizing the state government for failing to uphold justice and women's safety. He referred to the incident as worse than a ""Kangaroo Court"" scenario, demanding accountability from the administration.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also weighed in on a separate incident, condemning an alleged assault on a minority woman in Cooch Behar. ""Attacks on women, irrespective of their caste, are unacceptable... Elections have been held, results have been declared, and the ruling party has won the maximum seats in the state, so why is the government resorting to violence in the state? Nowhere in the country are we seeing such cases as are seen in Bengal after the elections? No one has the right to exercise violence against women,"" Chowdhury said.Local TMC MLA Hamidur Rahman, however, has distanced himself from the accused, characterizing the incident as a local matter unrelated to the party.TMC district president Kaniyalal Agarwal attributed the assault to disapproval within the community regarding the couple's alleged relationship. He said the alleged illicit relationship ""did not go down well with the villagers"".TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen condemned the incident but also pointed out that such kangaroo courts were common during the Left Front regime too.","A video shows a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.

"3 new criminal laws kick in today, data ousts 'danda' as policing tool",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-new-criminal-laws-kick-in-today-data-ousts-danda-as-policing-tool/articleshow/111387621.cms,"Top Picks For You New criminal laws to change the way justice is delivered

NEW DELHI: The criminal justice system is set for a major overhaul with the three new criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - coming into force on Monday, replacing the British-era Indian Penal Code , Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act .Starting Monday, all FIRs will be registered under the provisions of BNS.However, all cases registered before July 1 will continue to be tried under IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act until final disposal.BNS has 358 sections, down from 511 in IPC. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC, duration of imprisonment extended in 41 crimes, fines increased in 82 crimes, minimum punishment introduced in 25 crimes, community service introduced as penalty in six crimes and 19 sections removed.BNSS has 531 sections as against 484 in CrPC, with changes in 177 sections, addition of nine sections and 39 sub-sections and deletion of 14 sections. The Indian Evidence Act, with 166 sections, is being replaced with BSA having 170 sections, with change in 24 sections, addition of two new sub-sections and deletion of six sections.BNS, BNSS and BSA are being implemented six months after they were enacted based on protracted and detailed consultations with all stakeholders including SC and HC judges, governors, chief ministers, civil servants, police officers, collectorates and Members of Parliament and legislative assemblies. Around 3,200 suggestions were received and examined over several rounds of talks, with home minister Amit Shah having taken 158 such meetings, leading to the drafting of a whole new set ofcriminal laws that seek to leverage technology to make India's criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world. The BNS, BNSS and BSA bills were referred to a parliamentary standing committee and most of its recommendations were accepted by the govt before bringing the bills to Parliament for approval.The underlying spirit of the new criminal laws , as PM Modi had stated at the All-India DGPs conference in Jan, is ""citizen first, dignity first and justice first"", with emphasis on the 'danda' (baton) being replaced by 'data' as a policing tool.While replying to the debate in Parliament on BNS, BNSS and BSA bills, Shah had underlined that the focus of the new laws was on justice delivery, while safeguarding the rights of victims as well as accused, rather than on punishment. Also, the colonial mindset apparent behind ordering of IPC sections - with those dealing with 'rajdroh' (treason) preceding ones related to serious offences like 'murder' and 'rape' - was being done away with.Under the , a person may report crime online, without having to visit a police station (online FIR) and also file a zero-FIR at any police station. A free copy of the FIR will be provided to the victim. In the event of arrest, the individual will have the right to inform a person of his choice. Arrest details will need to be prominently displayed within police stations and district headquarters.The new laws prioritise investigation for offences against women and children, ensuring timely completion within two months of recording information. Victims shall be entitled to updates on the progress of their case within 90 days.Courts may now grant a maximum of two adjournments to avoid unnecessary delays in case hearings.","Three new criminal laws come into force on Monday. They replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Evidence Act. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC.

a front-on attack on Modi-Shah

NEW DELHI: The much-awaited showdown between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi unfolded in dramatic fashion in Lok Sabha on Monday with the newly-appointed leader of opposition saying, ""those who call themselves Hindus indulge in hatred, violence and untruths 24x7"", drawing a strong rebuttal from the PM.Rahul's remarks, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President's address, inflamed what was already building up as an intense duel.Modi immediately got up to protest, saying, ""Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a serious issue.""Rahul shot back, ""Modiji, BJP , RSS are not the entire Hindu community... A Hindu can never spread violence or fear or hatred."" As treasury benches protested, he said, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi"".The exchange was one of many which marked Rahul's maiden speech as leader of opposition. While he appeared charged, targeting govt over Manipur, Agniveer, NEET and MSP, an indication of BJP's combative intent came right at the outset in the form of the PM's riposte to Rahul's jibe about his face betraying no expression. ""I have been taught by the Constitution and democracy to take the LoP seriously,"" Modi said.The PM got support from his senior colleagues. Home minister Amit Shah supported Modi's charge that Rahul had insulted Hindus. ""Crores of people in country proudly call themselves Hindus. Are they all speaking about violence? Linking violence to any religion, that too by somebody holding a constitutional position... I believe he should apologise,"" Shah said. With the treasury benches up in arms, Rahul retorted, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahin.""Rahul said when opposition was ""violently crushed"", with two CMs put in jail, they sought refuge in ""Shiv ji"", as he flashed a poster of the deity. The Speaker and BJP members objected to it. He said the snake around Shiva's neck, trident behind his left shoulder and ""abhay mudra"" taught fearlessness, non-violence and courage.He said BJP brass spent 10 years spreading ""hate, fear and violence"" against anyone who opposed their policies, calling such actions contrary to the teachings of Lord Shiva and precepts of other religions. He said the two BJP tenures witnessed relentless assault on the foundational ideas of India and the Constitution, with farmers, students, small businessmen, opposition and soldiers bearing the brunt of whimsical policies and ""vendetta"". He also repeatedly mocked PM as ""non-biological"" who has ""direct connection with the almighty"", ribbing Modi on his campaign-time claims.Rahul also referred to Ayodhya, saying BJP MP Anurag Thakur had spoken on the topic. ""Anurag had talked about the attack on Sanatan Dharma, that's why I have done this. I want to show what happened in Ayodhya, what was the truth of Ayodhya..."" Gandhi said people of Ayodhya have given a message by defeating BJP.Rahul's speech on the motion of thanks to the President's joint address, his first as the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, was a biting, front-on attack on Modi and Shah, who along with defence minister Rajnath Singh occupied the front row for the address.Rahul also congratulated BJP on winning 240 seats and promised support. ""Opposition is not your enemy. We are here to make your job easier,"" he said. However, he also urged them to ""not spread fear and hatred"".","Rahul's remarks inflamed what was already building up as an intense duel.

Undermine Trust: Court

NEW DELHI: A city court on Monday sentenced activist Medha Patkar (70) to five months of simple imprisonment in a criminal defamation case filed by Delhi LG VK Saxena .The court of metropolitan magistrate Raghav Sharma took note of the activist's age and medical condition but observed these factors ""do not absolve her of the serious nature of her offence"", reported.The court directed Patkar to pay Rs 10 lakh as compensation to LG Saxena, saying the imposition of the substantial fine recognises the ""extensive harm and prolonged suffering that the complainant had endured over the 23-24 years of legal battle"" and was a tangible acknowledgement of his distress.The offence entails a maximum punishment of simple imprisonment of up to two years or fine or both.The sentence will remain suspended for 30 days to give Patkar enough opportunity to file an appeal, said the court. It had on May 24 convicted the activist in the case filed in 2000 by Saxena when he was president of National Council of Civil Liberties because of a defamatory press release.""The unfounded accusations, such as involvement in hawala transactions and compromising the interests of Gujarat's people for foreign entities, were designed to ruin the complainant's public image and credibility. The complainant experienced profound damage to hisreputation , trustworthiness and social standing. These defamatory remarks led to severe personal and professional hardships, forcing the complainant to suffer through the anguish of a drawn-out legal battle for over 20 years,"" said the court.Advocates Gajinder Kumar and Kiran Jai, Saxena's counsels, requested the court that the fine amount be given to Delhi State Legal Services Authority. Responding to this, the court said that the complainant could dispense the amount as per his own wish after receiving it.Taking note of Patkar's distinguished status, which got her 28 national and five international awards, including Right to Livelihood Award (alternative Nobel), the court remarked that this makes her actions ""even more reprehensible"" and that her respectable position in society brings with it a responsibility to uphold the truth and act with integrity.""The fact that someone of her stature made such false and damaging allegations aggravates her liability as it undermines public trust and sets a negative example,"" the court noted. However, referring to her age as well as medical condition, the court said a balanced approach was required and it wished to impose a ""just and humane"" punishment.Rejecting the request of Patkar's counsels for probation, the court said her actions exhibit a ""high degree of severity and intentionality"", clearly aimed at inflicting significant reputational harm on Saxena and there is no indication of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the damage inflicted on him.The court said that by accusing Saxena of involvement in hawala transactions, Patkar had linked him to illegal financial activities without any evidence and seriously undermined his financial integrity and public trust.Furthermore, the accusation that he was ""mortgaging the people of Gujarat and their resources to foreign interests"" suggested that he was betraying the trust of the citizens of Gujarat for personal gain, which is a grave imputation that irreparably damaged his reputation and standing, the court said. Labelling the complainant a ""coward"" and ""not a patriot"" further intensified the defamatory nature of the accusations, the court said.","A city court on Monday sentenced activist Medha Patkar to five months of simple imprisonment in a criminal defamation case.

BJP's all-out counter attack

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday took repeated digs at Prime Minister Modi and unleashed an all-out attack on the BJP as his first speech as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha gave a glimpse of the new power equation in the Lower House after Lok Sabha elections 2024 which has changed the number dynamics.Rahul's remark ""Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred and untruth ..."" targeted at the BJP triggered a massive uproar in Lok Sabha from the treasury benches and saw a rare faceoff between the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition.From the Agniveer scheme to the NEET row, Rahul fired several salvos at the government amid strong rebuttals from several Union ministers. The Congress leader did not spare Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla as well, citing his differential treatment to leader of opposition and PM Modi after they together escorted the Speaker to his chair.Rahul made several references to Lord Shiva, whose picture he showed to the House despite several requests by the Speaker, to drive home what appeared to be the central theme of his speech 'Don't be scared and don't scare others (daro mat, darao mat)'.Holding up pictures of Lord Shiva, Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ, he referred to Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism and Jainism to underline the importance of fearlessness.When the treasury-bench members protested, Rahul slammed the BJP, saying, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus). It is clearly written in Hinduism that one should stand with the truth and not back down from the truth or be scared of it."" When PM Modi intervened, Rahul shot back and said BJP, RSS or Modi do not represent the entire Hindus.Later when Rahul alleged that ministers do not greet him due to the fear of Modi, the Prime Minister intervened once again and said democracy and the Constitution have taught him to take the leader of opposition seriously.The impact of changed numbers in Lok Sabha was clearly visible as a united opposition was ready to match the lung power of the treasury benches all through Rahul's speech.Rahul Gandhi was unsparing in his attack on Prime Minister Modi. Citing one of Prime Minister's remarks made during campaigning, Rahul said ""Parmatma speaks directly to Modiji's atma.""He then went on to take a dig at another remark on how a movie had revived Mahatma Gandhi. Rahul said Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that Mahatma Gandhi was revived by a movie but the Father of the Nation was always alive.Rahul alleged that the BJP was spreading fear among every section of society.""You scare the minorities ... you spread violence, hatred against minorities, against Muslims, against Sikhs, against Christians. And what have the minorities done? They represent India in every sphere, they make India proud,"" the leader of opposition said.""They stand steadfast with India like mountains, they are patriots and you attacked all the minorities, spread violence and hatred against them,"" he added.Rahul then went on to attack the government on issues like Manipur violence, the Agniveer scheme which he called the brainchild of PMO and not the Army. He called Agniveers “use and throw labourers,” evoking strong objection from defence minister Rajnath Singh. Rahul attacked government over medical entrance test NEET and said it is not a professional exam but a ""commercial"" one that has been designed for the rich and not for meritorious people. On Manipur, he again targeted PM Modi and said for the government it seems Manipur is not part of India.Rahul's aggressive speech evoked very strong reactions from several leaders and ministers of the BJP. They not just slammed Rahul but also sought an apology from the leader of opposition for making baseless allegations and ""peddling lies.""The RSS hit out at Rahul for his ""not Hindus"" jibe at the ruling BJP and said it was ""unfortunate"" that the leader of opposition linked Hindutva with violence.Reacting to the Congress leader's remarks, senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary Sunil Ambedkar said, ""People occupying important positions linking Hindutva with violence is unfortunate.""""Whether it is the Hindutva of (Swami) Vivekananda or (Mahatma) Gandhi, it is a symbol of harmony and brotherhood,"" he added.Many Hindu saints also condemned Rahul Gandhi's ""not Hindus"" jibe at the BJP and demanded an apology from him.(With inputs from agencies)","Rahul's remark ""Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred and untruth..."" triggered a massive uproar in Lok Sabha from the treasury benches.

I am calling him a martyr, but govt doesn't acknowledge him as a martyr. The family won't receive a pension or compensation, nor will their son be recognised as a martyr.""Rajnath Singh reacted promptly, saying that the Congress leader was speaking a blatant lie.Rahul also claimed that the Agnipath scheme was imposed on the Army by the PMO and it didn't have enough acceptance in the armed forces.The defence minister, in a strong rebuttal to LoP's charges, informed the House that govt held direct consultations with at least 158 organisations before rolling out the project and added that their views and suggestions were factored in.""LoP must understand the scheme first,"" Singh said and demanded that Rahul's references to Agniveers be expunged from the House proceedings.Later, Shah urged Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that the statements made by Rahul and the defence minister should be scrutinised and the country must be told the truth. ""This House is not for spreading lies. Rahul should apologise to the House, to the country and to Agniveers,"" he said.The former Congress chief also slammed govt over farmers' issues, saying it did not want to give a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for crops.

Some may feel they are not,"" he said.Rahul was particularly acerbic on Modi, whom he repeatedly teased as ""non biological"" - we all are born and we die, but ""parmatma"" speaks to ""atma"" of Modi. He laughed that Modi had claimed that Mahatma Gandhi was dead and was revived by a movie. It was a reference to Modi's claim in an interview that he was ""non biological"" and messenger of the divine. He mocked that demonetisation and order to give Mumbai airport to Adani were also God's messages.Rahul said SP's Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad told him that Modi commissioned three surveys with the idea of contesting from ""Ayodhya"", but his surveyors told him that he would lose. He then went to Varanasi, and barely escaped defeat.To demonstrate his point about ""abhay mudra"" and religions preaching fearlessness, Rahul showed pictures of Lord Shiva, an Islamic motif, Jesus Christ, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Buddha and Mahaveer. When he picked Shiva's photo again, he pointed to the giant screens in the House and complained that the camera was not on him, an echo of an old complaint. The cameras returned to him, but when he picked the photo again, the focus went back to the Chair. It led to laughter in the House.Poking fun, Rahul said Modi not only spreads fear outside but has also intimidated the BJP functionaries, pointing out that Rajnath who had earlier greeted him with a smile was now sitting seriously in the PM's presence. Then, Rahul lectured BJP on ""internal democracy"", stating that opposition parties have it, even mentioning Congress' ginger group - ""G-22, G-23"".When Shah made a stray quip to his account of a Gujarat trip, Rahul said, ""I keep going to Gujarat, and this time we will defeat you there. Take it in writing, INDIA will defeat you.""Once, Shah objected to Rahul alleging that BJP had called farmers ""terrorists"". But Rahul pointed to Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Badal, and said ""your ally is nodding, she also agrees with us.""","Rahul was particularly acerbic on Modi, whom he repeatedly teased as ""non biological"" He laughed that Modi had claimed that Mahatma Gandhi was dead and was revived by a movie.

NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks. The change was accepted by Supreme Court .The official statement on Monday read: ""Pursuant to the Order ... a Re-Test was held for 1,563 candidates on 23 June 2024 ..., out of which a total of 813 candidates appeared therein,"" adding, ""It is now informed that revised Score Cards of all Candidates of NEET (UG) 2024 (including of 1,563 Candidates who appeared in the Re-Test on 23 June 2024), are being hosted on the website...""Chandigarh, which had just two candidates registered, saw zero attendance. The Jhajjar centre, which was under scrutiny, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the test.The NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres, saw a little over 23 lakh of the 24 lakh candidates taking the exam. 67 students initially scored a perfect 720, an unprecedented number in NEET's history, with six from one centre in Haryana, raising suspicions of irregularities and the role of grace marks.The NEET-UG exam, conducted by the NTA, is for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in govt and private institutions across India.The agency is currently under scrutiny for alleged irregularities in the exam, including a paper leak, with various groups calling for a retest.","60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score.

The police submitted the 350-page chargesheet against five Bishnoi gang members to the Panvel magistrate court last week, detailing the plot, planned attack and escape routes.The five named in the chargesheet are Dhananjay Tapsingh alias Ajay Kashyap (28), Gautam Vinod Bhatia (29), Vaspi Mehmood Khan alias China (36), Rizwan Hassan alias Javed Khan (25), and Deepak Hawasingh alias John Walmiki (30). Police have invoked IPC Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 115 (abetment), and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation).In early April, Panvel police inspector Nitin Thackeray received intelligence about Bishnoi gang members planning an attack on Khan. Investigations revealed that Bishnoi had given a Rs 25 lakh supari (contract) to gang members to attack Khan. The gang used a WhatsApp group with 15-16 members, including Bishnoi's Canada-based cousin Anmol Bishnoi, Goldy Brar, Ajay Kashyap, Vinod Bhatia, Vaspi Mehmood Khan alias China and Rizwan Hassan Khan to communicate and execute the attack.The police have identified Sukha Shooter and Dogar from Pakistan, who were supposed to supply sophisticated weapons like AK-47, M16, or M5. Kashyap rented a house near Khan's Panvel farmhouse to understand the area's topography. Kashyap and Javed China had already conducted recce of Khan's farmhouse in Panvel, Film City in Goregaon, and his Bandra residence.","The attack was allegedly planned to be carried out either during a movie shoot or while the actor was leaving his Panvel farmhouse.

Dowry Case: Dowry Case Quashed: US-Based Husband Granted Liberty to Prosecute Wife by HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-grants-us-based-man-liberty-to-prosecute-wife-in-dowry-case/articleshow/111372527.cms,"‘Gross misuse of law’

Bengaluru: Citing gross abuse of the process of law, the high court has quashed a dowry harassment and cruelty case brought by a Bengaluru woman against her US-based husband.Quashing the FIR registered by Basavanagudi women police and the chargesheet filed before the city’s 37th additional chief metropolitan magistrate against the husband, Justice M Nagaprasanna has granted liberty to him to prosecute his wife for “malicious prosecution”.The couple married in May 2020. After about two months, the husband went to the US as his H1B visa was to expire soon.He claimed that in Jan 2021, his wife left her matrimonial home to live in a relative’s house. Though the wife got four appointments till May 2021, she failed to attend the visa office to complete the formalities. In Sep, 2021, she was granted a visa in the 5th attempt. As the relationship between the couple turned incorrigible, the husband moved the family court in Bengaluru in Dec 2021, seeking divorce and also filed a police complaint against his wife.In Feb 2022, the wife too filed a complaint against her husband for offences punishable under the Dowry Prohibition Act. Police filed a chargesheet against him and the magistrate court took cognizance of the same in June, 2022.The wife argued that her husband suffered from a sexually transmitted disease and didn't intend to take her to the US and had blocked all channels of communication. She stated that though her husband earned more than Rs 2 crore annually, he didn’t want to part with the same on settlement.Challenging the proceedings, the husband claimed that she had left no stone unturned in painting him black by getting him medically tested, including a test for human papillomavirus infection, a sexually transmitted disease, which all went in vain. According to him, she only wanted his money and demanded Rs 3 crore after all conciliation efforts failed.Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the wife was given 614 grams of silver and 160 grams of gold as per tradition of ‘streedhana’ and the statements of her mother and brother as well as chargesheet materials did not indicate any demand for dowry made by the husband or any cruelty inflicted upon her.The judge pointed out that a mail communication in Dec 2021 showed that the husband had sought confirmation regarding her travel to the US and therefore, it was clearly a bogey projected by her by saying he was not interested in taking her to the US. “The unmistakable conclusion is that the complainant, in gross misuse and abuse of law, has set the criminal law into motion” the judge said.“Such frivolous cases registered by the wife have taken enormous judicial time, be it before the concerned court or before this court, and has led to enormous civil unrest, destruction of harmony and happiness in society. It may not be that these would be the facts in every given case. The court is only concerned about frivolous and vexatious litigations clogging the criminal justice delivery system, where genuine cases lie in the cold storage,” he said.“If the facts narrated herein above are noticed and as observed, the complainant has, in gross misuse and abuse of the process of the law, has set the criminal law into motion. Therefore, it becomes a fit case where the husband must be given the liberty to initiate proceedings for malicious prosecution or initiate proceedings under Section 211 of the IPC. Liberty is thus reserved to the husband, for such action to be initiated in accordance with law, if he so desires,” the judge observed while quashing the proceedings against the husband.","Citing gross abuse of the process of law, the high court has quashed a dowry harassment and cruelty case brought by a Bengaluru woman against her US-based husband.

50k doses of semen & counting: Meet UP’s elite breeder bull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/50k-doses-of-semen-counting-meet-ups-elite-breeder-bull/articleshow/111374226.cms,"Having contributed over 50,000 doses of semen , Gorakh, the lone Gangatiri bull at the Uttar Pradesh government’s Hapur farm, has emerged a pioneer in the conservation and propagation of high quality Gangatiri germplasm in UP .Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost.A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk every day.The genetically improved breed, however, may have a higher yield. The breed was registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in 2015.Born on Jan 29, 2014, Gorakh has his parentage verified and that’s what made him qualify as the donor for production of sexed semen (in which 90% Y chromosomes are removed) for Gangatiri breed of cows in the state. The two female Gangatiri calves, which were born at the govt’s Varanasi farm on March 26 and March 27, using embryo transfer technology and IVF for Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, are Gorakh’s progenies. The bull produces over 2200 doses of semen every month.Having a specific ID number, 287020, Gorakh will go strong for at least three more years, says his record. He was born at a gaushala in Mirzapur to Rahu and Pinki, both of whom were elite cows themselves. His induction at the Hapur farm took place in Jan 2015, when he was only a year old. His training for semen collection programme started in August 2019 and two months later, the farm started collecting his semen.Considering that bulls become sexually productive mostly by age of three and may go on to be productive for minimum for up to eight years of age and maximum for up to 15 years or even 18 years, as has been seen in a few cases, Gorakh may have a lot left in him still to give to the programme that he is already contributing to, especially when his record says that he is a bull with good libido and good quality semen.As far as his temperament is concerned, his keepers call him gentle. If Gorakh has been able to donate over 50,000 doses of semen till now, it’s because he has been on a herbal libido enhancer and a balanced diet. His daily diet comprises 7.5 kg of balanced concentrate with 12 kg dry fodder and premix of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. His exercise regimen is also strict and regular to keep him healthy and fit. The farm spends around Rs30,000 on his upkeep every month.It is a tough scan that a bull goes through to qualify as a sperm donor. The first stage is rearing. Many bulls get ousted at this very stage as they may not match the physical standards, or their sperm concentration may be low. The second is the training stage, where the bulls are trained to ejaculate with dummy partners present around to stimulate them. It is the final stage, the collection stage, in which the bull starts donating sperm.There are standards defined for the collection stage as well. The sperm count should be at least 500million per ml of semen for the bull to qualify as the donor. Each ejaculation gives 3-4ml of semen. Gorakh may have already matched the minimum standards to emerge as the pioneer sperm donor for Gangatiri cows. At present, he is the only male contributor to the programme. Officials said that there was one more male, but he died a few years ago.Dr Neeraj Gupta, CEO, UP Livestock Development Board, said, “There are norms defined for every stage. Each stage is monitored by experts. The collection is done scientifically and under the supervision of the experts.”The dummy partners for Gorakh are other male bulls, who are given an artificial vagina, which has a standard temperature of 37 degrees C to provide natural warmth to the male during ejaculation. Gorakh would mount the dummy partners each time he issexually stimulated. The process is done in the presence of experts and it has to be a swift collection of semen. The sperm is flushed twice a week, if done more, the semen quality might deteriorate. Every time the semen is flushed, it gives at least 200 doses, which is 400 doses in a week. Going by the standards, 2 lakh doses of semen may be taken from a bull in its lifetime.Gorakh is ten years but fit to go long. When embryo transfer technology (ETT) and IVF were used to produce Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, at UP’s Varanasi farm, in July-August 2023, four elite females at the farm were selected as the egg donors, after their records of lactation and parentage were verified. The sexed semen from Gorakh was used to fertilize the eggs in-vivo (inside the body).Later, after about seven days, the embryos were flushed from the donor cows and transferred into four recipient cows, who may not have been of high merit for being merely the surrogate. At the end, because only two pregnancies were successful, two calves were born.The ETT is being extensively used for improvement of indigenous cow breeds at various places as elite cows are used as egg and sperm donors. The standard gestation period for cows is over nine months. Going by that standard, one female may produce one calf in a year, mostly. Through ETT, an elite cow can produce multiple progenies in a year. Ravinder, principal secretary, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, said, “In the current booming era of Artificial Intelligence, future strategy and better planning on artificial insemination (AI) will bring significant improvement in the entire livestock herd and reduce the risk of financial insecurity of farmers from unpredictable loss of agriculture returns. In the near future, the calf born through AI with elite genetics is going to pay a premium to farmers as predictive analytics can be made much before the progeny comes into production.”","Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its ' Team of the Tournament ' for the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Despite playing a key role in India's victory over South Africa in the final, star batter Virat Kohli did not find a place in this select squad.India clinched their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling climax.Kohli, who was promoted to opener for the tournament, had a relatively quiet World Cup until the grand finale, where he produced a match-winning knock of 76 runs off 59 balls and was named the player of the match. Despite his heroics, Kohli was omitted from the ICC XI.The ICC’s lineup featured six Indian players, reflecting their strong overall performance. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah , and Arshdeep Singh were all included. Rohit led from the front, amassing 257 runs at an impressive strike rate of 156.7, making him the second-highest run-scorer behind Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz.One of the standout performers, Jasprit Bumrah, was named Player of the Tournament. Bumrah took 15 wickets and more importantly, his ability to restrict the scoring rate made him India's trump card. His economy rate of 4.17 was the best recorded by a bowler in a single edition of the men's T20 World Cup.Following a historic semi-final finish, PTI has reported that Afghanistan had three players making it to the ICC team. Left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi topped the wicket-taking charts alongside India’s Arshdeep Singh with 17 wickets each. Wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who led the run charts with 281 runs, and captain Rashid Khan were the other inclusions from Afghanistan.Skipper Rashid Khan led Afghanistan brilliantly, claiming 14 wickets at an economy of 6.17, showcasing his prowess as both a leader and a player.Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran rounded out the XI, bringing additional balance to the team.South Africa, despite being the runners-up, did not have a player in the XI. However, pacer Anrich Nortje was named the 12th man.Overall, the ICC's 'Team of the Tournament' reflects a mix of individual brilliance and consistent performance across the event, highlighting the standout players who made a significant impact.Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh (all Indians); Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi (Afghanistan); Marcus Stoinis (Australia) and Nicholas Pooran (West Indies);Anrich Nortje.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its'Team of the Tournament'for the recently concluded T20 World Cup.

However, the government declared Karaikudi , Tiruvannamalai, Pudukottai, and Namakkal as corporations in March due to their historical significance and pilgrimage appeal, despite their populations being under three lakh.“In many of the district headquarters, historically important towns and pilgrimage towns having less than the prescribed population and income limit, there is continuous vertical growth because of robust urbanisation, and there is a need for better infrastructure facilities necessitating the declaration of such local areas as a town panchayat, municipality or corporation,” said municipal administration minister K N Nehru.He noted that there were 11 district collectorates located in village panchayats in the state which have to be upgraded and tourist destinations which also have to be upgraded. More than 56 MLAs have given representations to upgrade to municipalities.The assembly passed a bill mandating that owners or occupiers of any premises or private streets where there is a sewer within 30 metre must get a sewer connection.Other bills approved include the repeal of 111 outdated and redundant laws and 115 Appropriation Acts enacted between 2001 and 2022.

The Army is spending huge amounts on a battery of lawyers to defend itself against the case made out by Singh.Claiming that he was made a ‘scapegoat’ by the then top brass of the Army to cover up their mistakes that led to the Kargil War , Singh is not only seeking his professional restitution, but also a complete investigation into the Kargil War.Initially, he had moved the Delhi high court in 2002.His main allegations are that intrusion was facilitated rather than taking prompt action on the inputs given by him.Following the constitution of military tribunals in the country, the case was referred to AFT’s Delhi bench in 2010. Later, on request of Singh, who is settled in Chandigarh and lost his hearing during the Kargil War, the matter was shifted to AFT Chandigarh in 2010 on medical grounds.According to the officer, he was “made scapegoat by senior Army officers to cover their faults.”“I know, it’s a fight between two unequal forces but the honour of my troops, brigade and my khandan (clan) is at stake, and I will continue to fight,” says Singh.The veteran, who has been granted all the retiral benefits including pension, is pursuing the matter only to restore his honour.During the long pending litigation, Singh has suffered physical, mental as well as financial harassment, but he has faithfully stuck to his stand that he is innocent.During the War, Brig Singh was posted as the commander of 121 Infantry Brigade group, popularly known as the Kargil Brigade .He was dismissed from service on the basis of a Court of Inquiry (COI), held on Sept 1999 by 3-Infantry division, in which he was found to be held guilty of retaining classified documents at his residence, failure to surrender classified document on relinquishing the charge of the brigade, making additional photocopies of classified documents and similar other charges under various provisions of Pamphlet Handling of Classified Documents, 1966.He is the first Army officer who was dismissed from the service without any general court martial (GCM).Advocate MP Goswami , who has been representing Singh in this case for a long time, said that this is perhaps the oldest case left with the AFT for final adjudication. Goswami, however, said that they are hopeful that the tribunal would soon give its verdict on the issue.",Brig Surinder Singh is the only Army officer who was sacked without a general court martial (GCM) by the Army as a fallout of the Kargil War.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

We frequently hear stories of actors who become overly committed to a part and struggle to let go of it. Ranveer Singh is one of those actors who shared this story. He revealed that the character of Allaudin Khilji in the film ‘ Padmaavat ’ was so dark and complicated that he was frightened he would fall into a deep pit from which he could never come out.He had disclosed that, in order to get ready for the part, he would shut himself up in his Goregaon house, where he was completely empty.But recently, in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, actor Prashant Narayanan questioned Ranveer's methodology. He said, “Woh jhoot bol raha hai. Yeh dark spaces mein jana, yeh sab karna yeh bakwas ki baatein hai.”Now, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer. He yelled aggressively, ""It's about Narayanan's remarks from a conversation with Shubankar Mishra.""Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has been in the profession for years and is considered one of the finest actors of his generation, has spoken up in Ranveer’s support. When he was questioned about Narayanan’s recent remarks in a conversation with Shubankar Mishra, he angrily said, “The people who are calling it fake, did they bother to understand the actor’s process? Did they bother to understand how he was living his life when he was creating the character? They are simply judging him. We don’t know what a man is thinking when he’s coming up with a characterisation.”He further added, “They think it is pretentious. When you dive deep into a character, it is a very painful process. This is a very irresponsible thing to say. If there was no process, then what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight would not be possible… That man was extremely serious about his performance and that is why he excelled in the character; that’s how iconic characters are born. If we are going to take (the process) casually, then you’ll end up with people just blurting out dialogues randomly. This is what makes separates a good actor from the rest. You never know which part of his past he is tapping to get into character. You can’t take this so easily.”The actor emphasised that in order to enter the characters' heads, actors enter difficult places. He angrily asked in what way people are able to dismiss all of this as pretentious and if they have ever attempted to portray a role similar to this. He even called out Jim Sarbh and Prashant Narayanan for their remarks and said, “What are they doing now? Do you see what Bobby Deol has been doing lately? And what is the man who commented doing currently?”He concluded by saying, “Who are we to say if Ranveer should or should not put himself through a painful process? What if he did? How do we know it? It is very easy to make such comments. We cannot underestimate anyone.. This is an actor’s job.”In a recent interview with The Quint, Jim Sarbh stated, “There are all those actors who are like ‘You know, I was so stuck in my character that I had to get mental therapy for weeks after.’ I was like ‘shut up bro. You didn’t even know your lines on the day, what nonsense.”On the work front, Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s new film ‘Rautu Ka Raaz’ was released on ZEE5 on June 28.","Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer Singh.
