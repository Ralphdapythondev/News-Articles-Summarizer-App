India ready to work with K P Sharma Oli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ready-to-work-with-k-p-sharma-oli/articleshow/111703143.cms,"With K P Sharma Oli set to return as PM, India’s primary concern in the immediate run would be whether Oli, seen as pro-China in the past, will go ahead and sign the BRI implementation plan with China during his term in office. Nepal under P K Dahal Prachanda backed down from signing the agreement last month, when Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs Sun Weidong visited Kathmandu.Nepal joined the BRI in 2017 but it’s yet to approve the implementation plan which will clear the way for over a dozen BRI projects in the country.CPN-UML and N Carrived at a power sharing agreement last week, leaving the Prachanda-led govt woefully short of majority. India would have ideally liked Prachanda and NC to come together in the game of musical chairs that has unfolded repeatedly since the elections in 2022, but govt sources said India will be happy to work with Oli as well.Despite his alleged China tilt, and the controversy over Nepal’s new map during his previous term in office, Oli has been looking to build ties with India, acknowledging the role its neighbour can play in Nepal’s development. In fact, the chief of his party’s foreign po licy department, Rajan Bhattarai, said in an interview this week CPN-UML doesn’t believe that Nepal can progress or the interest of Nepalese people could be promoted by pursuing anti-India policy. The fact that he will be dependent on support from pro-India NC will also be a determining factor. NC has maintained that while financing BRI plans, Nepal must accept only grants, and not loans, from China.",Nepal joined the BRI in 2017 but it’s yet to approve the implementation plan which will clear the way for over a dozen BRI projects in the country.

The stoppage of water caused a shortage in some parts of the capital. Delhi Jal Board officials confirmed on Friday that the breach had been sealed and there was no leakage now. But because the concrete layering of the Carrier Lined Channel was yet to start, the flow of raw water could not resume.“Water is expected to be released into the canal by Saturday afternoon,” said a DJB official. “But that is only possible after the concrete layering is over. Haryana and DJB are working hard to fix the channel.”Water minister Atishi said, “The 7-metre wide and 15-metre barrier was built with earth and is now being reinforced with concrete. The work will be completed by la te Friday night, but the concrete will take 5-6 hours to set.” She was optimistic that Haryana would release water into the Munak Canal from around 7am on Saturday: “It takes around four hours for water to reach Dwarka and water treatment will, thus, restart by 10am on Saturday.”Dwarka has been worst hit by the water shortage . Against the usual capacity of 50 million gallons per day (MGD) there, production has dwindled to 14MGD. “There are around 350 housing societies in Dwarka and almost all are suffering because of the Munak Canal breach. There was sewage overflow in some areas too,” said Rakesh Gupta, president, Dwarka Federation of Group Housing Societies.In Dwarka Sector 12, Geeta Sharma said, “We were facing a scarcity for the past few days and this has only worsened the situation. There is a severe shortage of water in our society and DJB of ficials informed us it would take two-three days for normal supply. Till then, we’ll have to buy water. The tankers are also charging a higher amount than usual.”The Bawana and Nangloi treatment plants also couldn’t process enough water, impacting colonies in west Delhi. “There was no morning water supply today,” said Sanjay Gupta, chairman, Model Town Residents’ Welfare Association, on Friday. “In some pockets, there has been no supply since Wednesday. This is in addition to the problem of dirty and smelly water.”On Friday, cumulative water production dipped significantly by 50MGD, with the total output standing at 907MGD against the average demand of around 1,290MGD.","Delhi Jal Board officials confirmed on Friday that the breach had been sealed and there was no leakage now.

Gautam Gambhir faces setback as BCCI rejects his recommendations for support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-faces-setback-as-bcci-rejects-his-recommendations-for-support-staff-report/articleshow/111674262.cms,"NEW DELHI: Before officially stepping into his role as India’s head coach , Gautam Gambhir encountered a minor setback. Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them. Gambhir’s setback indicates the board’s commitment to maintaining its current strategy and structure for the Indian cricket team’s support personnel.The cricketing community now awaits the BCCI's final decision on the support staff that will work alongside Gambhir as he embarks on his new journey as India’s head coach.",Gautam Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach turned down.

There must be some material against the person before proceedings under the law can be initiated, it stressed.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah held that ""in the absence of the basic/primary material, it cannot be left to the untrammelled or arbitrary discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings"", which have life-altering and very serious consequences for the person.It said, Section 9 could not be invoked on the basis of hearsay or bald and vague allegation(s).""...the question is that does Section 9 of the Act empower the executive to pick a person at random, knock at his/her/their door, tell him/her/they/them 'We suspect you of being a foreigner'?...

Ipso facto just an allegation/accusation cannot lead to shifting of the burden to the accused, unless he/she is confronted with the allegation as also the material backing such allegation,"" the court said.The court said that there was no material in possession of authority which could raise suspicion on his nationality. After fighting a legal battle for two decades, SC came to his rescue and declared him Indian as all his relatives were also declared Indian citizens. The court also said that minor spelling mistakes in names on official documents could not be the sole reason to deny authenticity as happened in the case.""However, mere allegation, that too, being as vague as to mechanically reproduce simply the words which mirror the text of provisions in the Act cannot be permitted under law. Even for the person to discharge the burden statutorily imposed on him by virtue of Section 9 of the Act, the person has to be intimated of the information and material available against him, such that he/she can contest and defend the proceedings against him,""the court said.","Section 9 of the Foreigners Act outs the burden on an individual to prove he/she is not a foreigner.

When that cadet or officer gets married, under Army rules, the name of the person’s spouse is recorded as the person’s NOK instead of the parents.Captain’s father Ravi Pratap Singh and mother Manju Singh, in an interview to a TV channel, said they want change in NOK rules as their daughter-in-law Smriti Singh doesn’t live with them any more and she has changed her address (in office records) and that she now receives most entitlements after their son’s death.“The criteria set to NOK is not correct.

As per the latest forecast by US govt weather agencies released late Thursday, La Nina is now likely to set in around Sept, the last month of India's rainy season.Experts, however, do not expect a major setback for monsoon rainfall over the June-Sept season due to the projected delay in La Nina. The monsoon is currently 3% below normal over the country but the figure is expected to improve over the next two weeks.The update by agencies affiliated to US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) gave a 70% probability of La Nina developing in the Aug-Sept-Oct period, generally taken to mean the month of Sept. The note said the probability of La Nina forming in Aug had reduced to 48%. In the forecast released last month , the probability of La Nina setting in around Aug was 65%.In a La Nina event, surface waters in the east and central Pacific Ocean cool down below threshold temperatures, leading to associated changes in wind currents that impact weather around the world. The condition is a reverse of El Nino, where abnormal warming takes place. La Nina generally aids summer monsoon rainfall in India while El Nino often depresses it. In between the two states is a neutral or normal phase.""The projected delay in La Nina shouldn't be a cause of worry. The important thing from monsoon's standpoint is whether the sea surface temperature anomaly in the region known as Nino 3.4 (in the Pacific) goes below zero. At the moment, it is slightly above zero but is likely to fall into the negative zone by Aug. When that happens, monsoon usually gets strengthened,"" said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.","Latest forecast by US govt weather agencies released late Thursday.

TOI

NEW DELHI: Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar , in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services, could face termination of service and even criminal charges of forgery if the one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter finds any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.Sources in the government said the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests at AIIMS Delhi to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the ‘Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)’ category.“The panel will submit its findings to DoPT which will then forward the report with recommendations to the Maharashtra government, since she is allocated to the Maharashtra cadre. If found guilty of forging her OBC and disability papers, the state government could terminate her. Also, she may face criminal liability for forgery and misrepresentation,” a source said.The DoPT panel looking into Khedkar’s claims is likely to take the help of social justice ministry to verify her OBC status. Although she claims to be from the economically weaker category, the affidavit filed by her father, an ex-bureaucrat and a candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls, declared his assets at over Rs 40 crore. Khedkar was shown as the owner of flats and plots worth crores.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.A senior government functionary said this was not the first case of a civil services aspirant making incorrect disability claims for selection in the PwBD category. “There are instances almost every year when those selected on the basis of false disability claims have evaded the mandatory medical test at AIIMS Delhi and even escalated the matter to the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking testing elsewhere. Eventually, however, they could not secure an appointment after having failed the test,” the functionary told",Pooja Khedkar is in the eye of a storm over the authenticity of her disability and OBC status claims that got her appointed to the civil services. A one-man panel set by the Centre to probe the matter could find any misrepresentation or suppression of facts on her part.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111698564,imgsize-782756,width-400,resizemode-4/111698564.jpg"
Emergency anniversary to be ‘Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas’: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/emergency-anniversary-to-be-samvidhaan-hatya-diwas-government/articleshow/111698393.cms,"NEW DELHI: Escalating its counter to the ‘ Save Constitution ’ campaign that Congress and its partners started against BJP in the build-up to the Lok Sabha polls, the Centre on Friday notified June 25, the anniversary of the imposition of the Emergency in the country in 1975 by the then PM Indira Gandhi, as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’.“(It is)… a tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross misuse of power during the period of Emergency and also recommit people of India to not support in any manner such gross misuse of power in future,” the Union home ministry stated in its gazette notification.“On June 25, 1975, the then PM Indira Gandhi, in a brazen display of a dictatorial mindset, strangled the soul of our democracy by imposing Emergency on the nation. Lakhs of people were thrown behind bars for no fault of their own, and the voice of the media was silenced,” home minister Amit Shah wrote on X.BJP has been smarting under the realisation that Congress and other constituents of INDIA bloc managed to hurt the party’s prospects in UP, Maharashtra and Rajasthan in the LS polls by unleashing the “false propaganda” that BJP would change the Constitution to scrap caste quotas if it won over 400 seats. BJP’s own assessment, with which many independent political circles concur, was that the charge was effective in turning a large section of Dalits away from the party and nudging them towards the INDIA bloc.Shah further said, “The decision made by the govt led by PM Narendra Modi ji is intended to honour the spirit of millions who struggled to revive democracy despite facing inexplicable persecution at the hands of an oppressive govt. The observance of 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas' will help keep the eternal flame of individual freedom and the defence of our democracy alive in every Indian, thus preventing dictatorial forces like the Congress from repeating those horrors.”BJP's pushback, which started during the campaign with Modi denying the charge and saying that the boot was on the opposition's foot by pointing to efforts under Congress govts to bring in quotas for Muslims not allowed under the law, has since continued apace.President Droupadi Murmu, in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament, made a detailed reference to the Emergency and Modi spoke about it on multiple occasions, including in his customary media address ahead of the Parliament session and also in his reply to the debate on the President’s address.It can also bring out contradictions among opposition ranks on the issue as some important allies of Congress — from SP and RJD to DMK and CPM — were victims of excesses during Emergency.On the last day of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, they did not join Congress's protests against the statement read out by Speaker Om Birla to condemn the Emergency.","The Centre on Friday notified June 25, the anniversary of the imposition of the Emergency in the country in 1975 by the then PM Indira Gandhi, as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’“(It is)… a tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross misuse of power during the period of Emergency,” the Union home ministry stated in its gazette notification.
