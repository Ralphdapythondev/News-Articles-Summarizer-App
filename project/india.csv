‘Country wants answer’: Rahul slams PM over J&K attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/country-wants-answer-rahul-slams-pm-over-jk-attacks/articleshow/110952349.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi lashed out at PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday, accusing govt of failing to arrest the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in J&K’s Reasi , Kathua , and Doda on June 9, coinciding with the Union Council of ministers’ oath-taking ceremony.

Rahul posted on X, “(PM) is so busy responding to congratulatory messages that he is unable to hear the cries of families of the pilgrims killed brutally in J&K. The country wants an answer. Why haven’t those behind terror attacks been caught in BJP’s regime.”

Congress’ media and publicity department chairman, Pawan Khera, stressed that while Union ministers were taking oath and heads of states were visiting the country, India suffered a horrific terror attack in Reasi when terrorists fired upon a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori Temple to Katra.

“Did the victims not deserve a word of sympathy from the self-proclaimed ‘divine’ PM? Modi is busy posting responses to congratulatory tweets by Pakistani leaders — Nawaz Sharif and Pak PM Shahbaz Sharif. Why has he maintained a stoic silence?”

Khera also alleged, “BJP’s hollow claims of the return of peace and normalcy in J&K have been thoroughly exposed. Their ‘Naya Kashmir’ policy is an abject failure as BJP doesn’t bother to fight polls in the valley.”","Congress’ Rahul Gandhi lashed out at PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

VARANASI: SP MP Afzal Ansari , who has been blaming the UP govt for the death of his younger brother and gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari in Banda jail, on Wednesday praised Yogi Adityanath , saying the CM helped BJP win 30 seats while PM Narendra Modi’s “magic remained limited to not more than three seats in the state”, reports“Had Yogi not camped in Varanasi, retaining his seat would have proved difficult for Modi,” claimed Afzal. “Modi’s magic is over now as Varanasi constituency is surrounded by Chandauli, Ghazipur and Machhlishahr LS constituencies and BJP lost all three. Gone are the days when Modi’s magic led to a cascading effect in east UP, Bihar and West Bengal because of his candidature from Varanasi,” Afzal said, adding that keeping ground realities in view, Yogi made best efforts in the last phases, especially in Varanasi. Afzal said BJP should thank Yogi for “avoiding a major disaster” in UP. “Due to his hard work and efforts, 30 seats could be won by BJP,” the SP MP said.Afzal, however, alleged that to save some dreaded criminals, state govt ensured Mukhtar Ansari died in Banda jail.","SP MP Afzal Ansari has been blaming the UP govt for the death of his younger brother and gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari in Banda jail. “Modi’s magic is over now as Varanasi constituency is surrounded by Chandauli, Ghazipur and Machhlishahr LS constituencies and BJP lost all three,” he said.

KOLKATA: Bengal BJP Wednesday trained its guns on the role of central forces during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and alleged that “false voting“ had ruined the party’s chances in a number of constituencies.

“The central forces were deployed following EC’s order. But they did not have an independent role to play here. State police controlled them throughout the poll process,” Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said.

BJP’s Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar, too, raised questions on the central forces earlier in the day. “Where was the central force when Trinamool continued proxy and false voting ? I did not see them anywhere nearby. I have closely watched how they behaved on poll day,” Sarkar said.

Former Union minister Nishith Pramanik also alleged there had been false and proxy voting in nearly 8% of booths in Cooch Behar.

Adhikari said BJP had potential in a number of seats that they lost like Arambag, Midnapore, Bankura and Cooch Behar. “Proxy and false votes, this time, crossed a total of 25 lakh,” he claimed.

DEHRADUN: The Char Dham yatra has witnessed a significant increase in the number of pilgrims visiting the shrines this year, with the footfall already reaching 20 lakh in the first month, compared to 14.5 lakh last year, a spike of 38%, reports. This heavy influx of visitors has evoked concerns among environmentalists and the scientific community as it is leaving tangible and intangible impact on the shrine towns, which are situated in the ecologically-fragile Garhwal Himalayas .At least 2 lakh vehicles have made their way to these towns in the past month, which is way beyond the carrying capacity of the area. The vehicular vibration and emissions are not only causing pollution but also shaking up the hill slopes which may prompt landslides or mudslides during monsoon. Vibrations from back-to-back chopper flights are also contributing to the geological damage in the area, as per experts.Till June 10, 7.6 lakh people have visited Kedarnath, 4.8 lakh have visited Badrinath, and 3.5 lakh have visited Gangotri and Yamunotri each.","The footfall already reached 20 lakh in the first month, compared to 14.5 lakh last year, a spike of 38%, reports.

J&K police released a sketch of one of the terrorists and announced a reward of Rs 20 lakh for information about him.The suspected kingpins of the attack include former Pakistani army SSG commando turned Lashkar-e-Taiba operative Illiyas Fauji and three other Pakistan-based LeT terrorists: Abu Hamza, Handoon, and Sajjad Jutt. “They are also believed to have orchestrated a previous attack on an IAF convoy on May 4, which resulted in the death of an airman,” an official said.According to sources, at least three Pakistani LeT terrorists, acting on orders from their commander Abu Hamza, ambushed the bus with sophisticated weapons, including a US-made M4 Carbine, near Teryath village in Poni area of Reasi. The bus, en route from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Mata Vaishno Devi temple in Katra, veered off the road and tumbled down the mountainside.The attack resulted in nine fatalities, including a two-year-old child and a 14-year-old boy, and left 41 others wounded.

NEW DELHI: In response to the ongoing water crisis in Delhi, the government has taken decisive action by deploying high-level officials to each zone. These teams, consisting of Additional District Magistrates, Sub Divisional Magistrates, Tehsildars, and other officials, will serve as 'Quick Response Teams' to ensure the efficient distribution of water tankers and promptly address water-related complaints from residents.

Delhi minister Atishi has instructed the Chief Secretary to oversee these teams as they monitor and inspect the main water distribution network , starting from the water sources and extending to the water treatment plants (WTPs) and primary Underground Reservoirs (UGRs). The teams are tasked with identifying and repairing any leaks in the major pipelines within a 12-hour timeframe, emphasizing the importance of conserving every drop of water during this period of scarcity.

""In the meeting held on 30.05.2024 regarding the issue of prevailing heat wave condition and rise in demand of water, it was decided that from 5th June onwards ADM/SDM level officers would be deployed in each Zone, along with a team of Tehsildars and other officials who will act as a ' Quick Response Team ' for provision of water tankers and resolution of water-related complaints,"" Atishi said in her letter to the Chief Secretary.

Despite these efforts, many residents in various parts of Delhi continue to face water shortages, relying on water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has led to long queues in affected areas as people wait to collect water from these tankers.

The water crisis has also sparked a heated debate between Lieutenant-Governor VK Saxena and the AAP government, with each side pointing fingers at the other. The AAP government attributes the water shortage to the BJP-ruled Haryana government, claiming that it has failed to provide Delhi with its rightful share of water. However, the LG refutes this accusation.

After a phone conversation with Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday, Saxena released a statement asserting that Haryana has been releasing Delhi's allocated share of water into the Yamuna River via the Munak canal. The LG places the blame for the water crisis squarely on the Delhi government, alleging that the shortage is a result of the tanker mafia ""stealing water [from the canal] in connivance with the ruling AAP"".

The report's purpose is to establish a connection between the Porsche car's impact on the bike and the injuries suffered by the two deceased IT professionals . Police consider this report vital in determining the accused's role in the incident.

On May 19, the Porsche car, purportedly driven by a juvenile under the influence of alcohol , collided with a bike in Pune city's Kalyani Nagar area, resulting in the deaths of Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both IT professionals.

The juvenile driver is currently in an observation home, while the parents remain in police custody in relation to the alleged blood sample swapping case. Previously, the Pune District Court remanded the father and grandfather of the minor accused to police custody until May 31.

IF INDIA WIN

IF USA WIN

At the end of the T20 World Cup match between India and USA scheduled for later on Wednesday, Group A will have one of its two qualifiers for the 'Super 8' phase of the tournament.The 2007 champions India are primed to register a hat-trick of wins to advance to the next stage; but USA's giant-killing run can't be taken lightly.Ahead of the T20 World Cup, USA defeated Bangladesh to win a historic bilateral series -- their first against a Test-playing nation.It followed an even bigger upset, shocking Pakistan in their second group match of the T20 tournament. In between, the US team defeated neighbours Canada in the tournament opener.With two wins in as many matches, USA, like India, are unbeaten in the tournament; but face their biggest test against Rohit Sharma & Co.USA's stay at the top of the group after back-to-back wins didn't last for long as India won the battle against the archrivals Pakistan, beating them by six runs in a thrilling contest.The win took India (2 matches, 4 points, NRR +1.455) to No. 1 spot in Group A, followed by USA (2 matches, 4 points, NRR +0.626), Pakistan (3 matches, 2 points, NRR +0.191), Canada (3 matches, 2 points, NRR -0.493) and Ireland (2 matches, 0 point, NRR -1.712).Here's a look at how the result in India vs USA match on Wednesday will affect the 'Super 8' qualification scenario of the five teams in Group A:A victory for India will mean that the former champions will advance to the next stage, where they will join South Africa and Australia -- the two teams so far to have made it to the 'Super 8s'. That result will also breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign that stayed alive after their win over Canada. However, Pakistan will hope that India register a big win over USA and seriously dent the net run-rate of the American team, which at present is better than that of Pakistan's.But even if USA lose to India, they will have a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' with a win over Ireland in their last match, which will make all other remaining games in the group irrelevant and eliminate the other three teams.In case USA's dream run in their tournament debut continues with another upset win, they will go through to the 'Super 8s'. However, that result will not favour Pakistan, Canada and Ireland.If India lose to the US and win their last match against minnows Canada, they will join the co-hosts as the two teams in 'Super 8s' from Group A, putting the remaining three out of the race.",T20 World Cup match between India and USA scheduled for later on Wednesday.

Why Pawan Kalyan is the 'right leader at right time' in Andhra politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-pawan-kalyan-is-the-right-leader-at-right-time-in-andhra-politics/articleshow/110943090.cms,"What Pawan Kalyan and his Jana Sena Party did right

NEW DELHI: Chandrababu Naidu , who took oath as Andhra Pradesh chief minister today, recently described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ""right leader at the right time."" However, when it comes to state politics, it is Naidu's ally and Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan who has emerged as the ""right leader at the right time"" after the just-concluded elections. After a decade of struggle and several ups and downs, the superstar-turned-politician has finally tasted electoral success. And that too with a near 100% strike rate. Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party won both the Lok Sabha seats it contested from Andhra Pradesh and emerged as the second largest party in the state assembly winning 21 seats. Pawan Kalyan floated Jana Sena Party in 2014 and its first election was the 2019 though in 2014, the Jana Sena Party had supported the BJP and the TDP -- the power equation that worked for Andhra Pradesh in 2024.In 2019, Pawan Kalyan contested from two assembly constituencies -- Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram but lost both. In the face of a YSRCP wave at that time, the Jana Sena Party managed to get only 6% vote share. At that time Pawan Kalyan allied with the CPI, CPM and the Bahujan Samaj Party.In 2020, Pawan Kalyan announced an alliance with the BJP which took a formal shape in 2024 ahead of the election as TDP, JSP and the BJP joined hands. Chandrababu Naidu and Pawan Kalyan were the two leaders from Andhra Pradesh accompanying Narendra Modi when he went to file the Lok Sabha nomination from Varanasi.Pawan Kalyan did not switch sides but rejoined the NDA ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. In fact, he is believed to have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between the TDP and the Kapu caste -- as TDP is traditionally known as a party of the Kamma caste.Pawan Kalyan's official entry in politics was in 2007 when he worked for his brother Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party. From the beginning, he remained anti-Congress and so when Chiranjeevi merged his Praja Rajyam with the Congress, Pawan Kalyan distanced himself from politics. But he did not compromise on his ideology and after his hiatus floated the Jana Sena Party in 2014 with the slogan 'Congress hatao desh bachao'.In 2017, Pawan Kalyan pulled out of the NDA along with TDP accusing the BJP of cheating Andhra Pradesh on the promise of the special category status.Meanwhile, Pawan Kalyan worked on himself as a mass leader as his Jana Vani where he listened to people's grievances managed to get the pulse of the voters.",Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party won both the Lok Sabha seats it contested from Andhra Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: The bigwigs of politics and Tollywood gathered in Vijayawada on Wednesday to witness the oath ceremony of new Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu. But now that it's over, a video clip of an interaction between Union home minister Amit Shah and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has sparked speculation about potential rifts within the BJP 's state unit.The clip, which surfaced on social media, showed Tamilisai greeting Shah on stage as she walks past him. A second later, Shah calls her back and talks to her wagging his finger. The content of their conversation, however, remains unclear.The video has caught attention of many amid the speculation of rift between Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai and Tamilisai after the Lok Sabha debacle.BJP Tamil Nadu social media cell vice president Karthik Gopinath took to X and wrote: ""That looks like a strong admonishment from Amit shah ji to Tamilisai akka . But what could be the reason for this “public” warning? Unwarranted public comments?""Spokesperson of the DMK, Saravanan Annadurai said: ""What kind of politics is this? Is it polite to publicly reprimand a prominent female politician from Tamil Nadu? Amit Shah should know that everyone will see this. A very wrong example!""After BJP drew a blank in TN in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections, a section of party functionaries blamed Annamalai for the results. Tamilisai’s statements sparked fresh controversies as she opined that if BJP had teamed up with AIADMK, they would have won several seats.She also questioned postings given “to people with criminal history”. Though Annamalai was silent, his supporters clashed with supporters of Tamilisai on social media. Sources say that Annamalai, citing tug of war on social media, sought more control over the party.“Annamalai is unhappy about the fact that many party functionaries do not pay heed to him and urged leadership in Delhi to give him complete control of party reins to ensure a good performance in 2026 assembly election. We can expect a complete revamp of state BJP unit soon,” said another party senior, not willing to be named.Both Annamalai and Tamilisai lost as LS candidates. State general secretary of BJP OBC Morcha Tiruchi Suriyaa Siva hit back at Soundararajan for her comments earlier that “anti-social elements” were inducted into the party.Union minister for commerce Piyush Goyal, who is in-charge of Tamil Nadu, has also sought a report from members of state BJP’s core committee about the infighting and other issues pertaining to the state unit, multiple sources confirmed to TOI.","A video clip of an interaction between Union home minister Amit Shah and former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has sparked speculation about potential rifts within the BJP's state unit.

The political journey

NEW DELHI: A few days ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced actor-politician Pawan Kalyan in a meeting of NDA MPs: ""Yeh Pawan nahi hai, aandhi hai (He is not a breeze, but a storm)."" Amid thunderous applause, this remark came as Kalyan's Jana Sena Party took the political arena by storm with a historic victory in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections 2024 and Andhra Pradesh assembly elections by winning all the seats it contested.And now the 'aandhi', Kalyan, has taken a new role on Wednesday as he took charge as minister of Andhra Pradesh in N Chandrababu Naidu cabinet.Pawan Kalyan, a prominent figure in the Telugu film industry , has left an indelible mark on Tollywood through his remarkable acting career and influential persona. Born on September 2, 1971, in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh, Pawan Kalyan embarked on his journey in the entertainment world with his debut film ""Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi"" in 1996. Since then, he has captivated audiences with his charismatic screen presence and versatile performances.Pawan Kalyan's rise to stardom can be attributed to his ability to connect with the masses through his films. He has portrayed a wide range of characters, from the rebellious youth in ""Thammudu"" to the vigilante in ""Gabbar Singh."" His films often tackle social issues and showcase his strong convictions, earning him a loyal fan base that extends beyond the boundaries of the film industry.Beyond his acting prowess, Pawan Kalyan is also known for his philanthropic endeavors and political activism.The actor , who has earned the moniker 'Power Star' due to his dynamic performances in action movies, made his foray into the political arena in 2008. He joined forces with his brother Chiranjeevi's political party, Praja Rajyam Party (PRP).Despite the initial enthusiasm and support, the PRP failed to make a significant impact on the political landscape. The party's journey was short-lived, and it ultimately merged with the Congress party. This move marked the end of Pawan Kalyan's first political venture.In 2014, Kalyan established his own political party, JSP, but the party did not participate in the elections that year. Instead, he supported the TDP-BJP alliance, which came to power.The JSP contested its first assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh in 2019 independently. The party suffered a humiliating defeat, with Kalyan himself losing in both Assembly constituencies he contested – Gajuwaka of Visakhapatnam and Bhimavaram of West Godavari. The party managed to win only one seat, Razole assembly constituency (SC-reserved), but the MLA later defected to the YSR Congress party.Despite the electoral setback, Kalyan remained determined. He raised his voice against the ruling YSRCP and chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on various issues.In the latter half of 2022, Kalyan initiated 'Jana Vani', a series of small public meetings to listen to people's grievances. ""He was the only politician who worked to fight for public issues"" despite losing the 2019 elections, as noted by Businessline.When the YSRCP government cracked down on one such meeting in Visakhapatnam and arrested JSP cadres, it helped bring TDP chief Naidu and Pawan Kalyan back together.Kalyan also persistently reached out to BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and JP Nadda, even when he did not receive a warm response.Finally, Kalyan succeeded in forming an alliance among TDP, JSP, and BJP, which announced a pre-poll alliance in March.(With agency inputs)","Pawan Kalyan, a prominent figure in the Telugu film industry, has left an indelible mark on Tollywood through his remarkable acting career and influential persona.

"After Mohan Bhagwat's Manipur message, RSS-linked magazine says BJP workers were 'overconfident', some leaders 'happy in their bubble'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-mohan-bhagwats-manipur-message-rss-linked-magazine-says-bjp-workers-were-overconfident-some-leaders-happy-in-their-bubble/articleshow/110910409.cms,"Mohan Bhagwat's message

NEW DELHI: In the last 10 years, BJP's top leadership has come under several scathing attacks from the opposition ranks. But results of the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections seems to have opened a new worrying front for the saffron party, that failed to win a majority on its own despite Prime Minister Modi's strong ""abki baar, 400 paar pitch.""A day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat 's strong message on the ""neglect of Manipur for one year"" and ""lack of decorum"" during campaigning, an article in a magazine linked to the RSS says the BJP workers were overconfident and some party workers were happy in their ""bubble"" enjoying the glow of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aura but not listening to the voices on the streets.The article in the latest issue of ""Organiser"" magazine also noted that though the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is not a ""field force"" of the BJP, the party leaders and workers did not reach out to its 'swayamsevaks' (volunteers) seeking their cooperation in electoral work.Neglect of older dedicated workers who worked without the urge for recognition by the new age social media-aided selfie powered activists was also evident in the poll results, said the article written by Ratan Sharda who is a life-long member of the RSS.Sharda noted that the idea that Modi was fighting on all 543 Lok Sabha seats had “a limited value”. “This idea became self-defeating when the candidates were changed, imposed at the cost of local leaders and defectors given more importance. Sacrificing even well performing parliamentarians to accommodate late comers hurt. It is estimated that around 25 percent of candidates were seasonal migrants,” he said.“This happened despite the shocking experience of 30 per cent rebels in the last Himachal Pradesh elections that resulted in defeat of the BJP. Local issues, track record of the candidate does matter, one can see. Disinterest of local BJP workers was due to this factor too,” he added.Sharda, who has authored many books on the RSS, cited the case of Maharashtra to flag ""unnecessary politicking"" as one of the many reasons behind the BJP's underperformance in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP fared very badly in the state winning just 9 Lok Sabha seats.""Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,"" he said.""Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,"" he added.Sharda also pointed at the induction of some Congressmen into BJP, who had ""actively promoted"" the bogey of saffron terror and persecuted Hindus and also called 26/11 'RSS ki sazish' and branded RSS as a terrorist organisation. ""This showed the BJP ""in poor light"" and also hurt the RSS sympathisers ""immensely"","" he wrote in the article.The life-long RSS member also took a dig at the culture of posting selfies, which has been actively used to mobilise support by BJP's top leadership.""Showing off is more important by posting selfies with a multiplier effect is the new norm. If BJP volunteers don't reach out to RSS, they have to answer why they thought it was not required?"" he said.""To seek (RSS) swayamsevaks' cooperation in electoral work, BJP workers, local leaders need to reach out to their ideological allies. Did they? My experience and interaction tells me, they did not,"" Sharda said.""Was it lethargy, overconfidence, sense of comfort that 'Ayega to Modi hi, Abki bar 400 plus'? I do not know,"" he said.On Monday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had expressed concern over peace eluding Manipur even after one year and said the situation in the strife-torn north eastern state must be considered with priority.""The situation in Manipur will have to be considered with priority. There is need to get over election rhetoric and focus on problems facing the nation,"" the RSS chief asserted. The unrest either got triggered or was triggered, but Manipur is burning and people are facing its extreme heat, the RSS chief had said.The RSS chief stressed the need for consensus between the ruling side and the opposition so that work for common good (of the masses) can be carried out. Polls are to gain majority and it is a competition and not war, Bhagwat pointed out. Political parties and leaders bad-mouthing each other are not taking into account that these may cause rifts among communities, he said and lamented that even the RSS was being dragged into it without any reason. There are always two sides in an election but there should be dignity about not resorting to lies to win, the RSS chief asserted.Manipur plunged into violence between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May last year. Since then some 200 people have been killed, while thousands have been displaced following large scale arson that has gutted homes and government buildings. While Amit Shah and other senior ministers have visited the state several times, Prime Minister Modi has not visited Manipur ignoring the demands of several opposition leaders.(With inputs from agencies)","The article in ""Organiser"" magazine says the BJP workers were overconfident and some party workers were happy in their ""bubble"" The article was written by Ratan Sharda who is a life-long member of the RSS.

NEW DELHI: A day after taking oath of office for a historic third consecutive term , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assigned portfolios to his 71 council of ministers .The new Union Cabinet held its first meeting at the PM's residence in the evening following which the full list of portfolios was released.Signalling continuity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday retained four of his high-profile ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar of Home, Defence, Finance and External Affairs respectively in his new government.The four ministers in charge of these portfolios make up the crucial Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the prime minister.Among new entrants to the Union Cabinet, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has got Agriculture and Rural Development Ministries, while BJP president J P Nadda has returned to the Health Ministry, a portfolio he had held in the Modi government's first term before he took charge of the ruling BJP first as working president in 2019 and then as the full-fledged president in 2020.Among the five members of the BJP's allies in the Union Cabinet, JD(Secular)'s H D Kumaraswamy has got Heavy Industries, and Steel ministries, Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-Secular) has Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry, and Lalan Singh (Janata Dal-United) Panchayati Raj, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Ministries.TDP's K Rammohan Naidu has got the Civil Aviation Ministry and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan has been allocated the Food Processing Industries Ministry.Among Ministers of State with Independent Charge, BJP ally and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary has been allocated Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Ministry and Shiv Sena leader Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao will handle Ayush Ministry.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups.It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities.A record 18 senior ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before.

While the outgoing council of ministers had two ministers of state from BJP's allies -- Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal (S) and Ramdas Athawale of the RPI(A) -- this time, there are two ministers of states with independent charge and four ministers of state (MoS).As per the Constitution of India, the total strength of the council of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha MPs.The strength of the 18th Lok Sabha is 543 members and hence the council of ministers cannot be more than 81.The 2024 Lok Sabha election results were announced by the Election Commission of India on June 4, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats.

"How insurance cover helped 46,000 women avoid toiling in the sun during heatwave",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-insurance-cover-helped-46000-women-avoid-toiling-in-the-sun-during-heatwave/articleshow/110951433.cms,"In the city of Ahmedabad, temperatures climbed above 43C (109F) every day between May 19 and May 25, creating deadly hot working conditions for many of the labourers who keep the local economy humming.For 40-year-old Lataben Arvindbhai Makwana, it was unbearable to run her sewing machine inside her tin-roofed house, which has little ventilation and only a small ceiling fan. As a daily wage labourer, that meant she was not earning the money she needed to feed her kids and buy blood pressure medication for herself.""It's getting worse every summer,"" Makwana said. The heat is especially dangerous for people like her who suffer from hypertension.With climate change raising temperatures during heat waves , millions of Indians face a difficult choice: work in dangerous conditions or go hungry. But some women like Makwana are now getting help from a program to make a third choice: stop working for at least a few hours.As soon as temperatures breached 43.6C in Ahmedabad, Makwana and thousands of other women were told that ICICI Lombard, an insurance company, would pay them a portion of their daily wages. The program uses parametric insurance, which pays out when a particular metric is hit, such as a daily high temperature.More than 46,000 women across 22 districts in India were paid Rs 2,84,00,000 in total over last month's heat waves. About 50,000 women are enrolled in the program. Makwana's insurance payout was Rs 750, enough to cover food and medication for a few days. (That sum came on top of a separate charity payout of Rs 400 when the temperature breached 40C the first time.)The Self-Employed Women's Association labour union runs the insurance program. Its premium is paid for partly by the women enrolled in the program, with a charity covering the remaining portion. The pilot program launched last year and is set to run until April 2025.Kathy Baughman McLeod, chief executive officer of Climate Resilience for All, the non-profit supporting the program through development, technical expertise and funding, says it has been ""successful."" The charity plans to expand the insurance program to other parts of the world.Baughman Mcleod hopes that the funders supporting the Indian program can continue to do so for a few more years. Ultimately, the plan is to get SEWA 's 2.9 million members signed up, which would allow the plan to be funded entirely by women paying the premiums.""Our experience is that poor women don't want charity always,"" said Reema Nanavaty, general secretary of SEWA. ""Once they see that this program is addressing their dire needs, I'm sure the women would start contributing toward the program."" The eventual plan would see the premium for each woman be about a day's wage every month, she added. Bloomberg","Temperatures in Ahmedabad, India, reached 43.6C on May 19 and May 25.

KALYAN: Less than three weeks after a blast in the chemical reactor of a Dombivli MIDC factory killed 12 and left 68 injured, a major fire broke out in another factory just around 300 metres from the ill-fated plant on Wednesday, reports. While the factory was gutted in Wednesday’s blaze at Indo Amines, no one was injured as all its 10 employees rushed out in time. However, the blaze spread to the factory next to it, Malde Capacitors Manufacturing Company, which burned down too.After the blaze, a Indo Amines spokesperson said they had got a fire safety audit done just a month and half ago.The blaze led to panic among locals as the factory is situated near a large residential locality and a school, which was evacuated as the smoke began to affect students.Following the second blaze in weeks, locals who live between two phases of MIDC demanded that govt either shift dangerous chemical companies from the city or relocate them.Sena (UBT) functionary Vaishali Darekar said the Eknath Shinde govt has not learned any lessons from previous fires.","A major fire broke out in another factory just around 300 metres from the ill- fated plant on Wednesday.

New devices to check FASTag to cut toll plaza delays soon: NHAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-devices-to-check-fastag-to-cut-toll-plaza-delays-soon-nhai/articleshow/110950256.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon you may not have to wait in queues at toll gates due to technical glitches in reading FASTags strapped on vehicles , which often force toll booth operators to use handheld devices to read the smart tag.

The NHAI has ordered a major change in deployment of IT system and hardware at toll plazas for processing transactions through FASTag to make them hassle free for commuters. The highways authority will now only empanel players who have good experience, and they will have to mandatorily procure equipment from manufactures certified by Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification directorate of the ministry of electronics and IT.

The STQC certification will be mandatory for equipment, including RFID reader along with the antenna, automatic number plate reader, toll lane controller and toll plaza server, as per specifications issued by IHMCL, NHAI’s entity responsible for management of tolls.

According to the new specifications, the system integrators will have to give an undertaking to IHMCL that if any deviation are found at toll plazas designated to them because of equipment, the agency will have the right to immediately suspend the empanelment and forfeit the bank guarantee.

TOI , in a report titled ‘FASTag made highways cashless. Here’s why they aren’t jam-less’, had highlighted how commuters face hassle at toll gates even when their FASTags have enough balance due to glitches or inefficiency of hardware and system deployed at plazas that don’t read tags. Toll collectors asked commuters to take their vehicles back and forth or end up using hand-held devices to read the tag.

“We are taking a two-pronged approach to address issues people face due to technical reasons. First, people with experience can only get empanelled and the equipment has to be certified by the most credible govt agency. We are also going to deploy engineers at the regional offices of NHAI for better monitoring and resolution of issues,” said an official.

BHOPAL: Residents of Phoop area in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh claimed three people, including a 17-year-old youth, died after consuming contaminated tap water, even as the state govt and district administration denied this, only admitting that 76 people were taken ill. While 52 patients took ill on Monday, 24 more cases were reported on Tuesday. The incident was reported from two wards of the Phoop area, where patients complained of vomiting and diarrhoea.Sanjeev Srivastava, collector of Bhind, who visited the affected areas on Wednesday, toldthat 13 people are still hospitalised. “Seventy six people complained of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Three of them were referred to Gwalior while seven are still at the Morena health facility,” he said.He denied reports of any casualties and said all other patients were discharged after first aid. “An elderly person with multiple medical issues died, but we can’t say contaminated water was the reason for his death,” Srivastava said.Three ambulances were deployed in Phoop, while ambulances from Gwalior and Morena have been placed on alert.It’s likely that piped water became contaminated when new electricity poles were being installed adjacent to a drain in the area. The machinery used for earthwork likely damaged the domestic water supply line, allowing drain water to seep in and contaminate the water line, sources said.Residents, especially in Wards No. 5, 6, and 7, where the contaminated water was supplied Monday, were worst affected. As the number of patients increased, health dept issued an alert. The collector said they are monitoring the affected wards and patients have been given ORS and necessary medicines.","Residents of Phoop area in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh claimed three people, including a 17-year-old youth, died after consuming contaminated tap water.

Govt plans to import additional chana from Australia to check prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-plans-to-import-additional-chana-from-australia-to-check-prices/articleshow/110949799.cms,"SPIKE ALERT: As per Union consumer affairs ministry data, average retail prices of chana increased from Rs 74.7 per kg a year back to Rs 85.8 on June 13 and on Wednesday it stood at Rs 87.. (Lexica generated AI image)

NEW DELHI: As rise in price of pulses and fall in production of chana (bengal gram) remain a concern, govt is looking at importing 11 lakh tonne of chana from Australia soon. This will be in addition to the import of 16 lakh tonne of yellow peas used as substitute of chana in the past six months since govt did away with the import duty.

Sources said govt has sounded out Australia about the plan to import more chana in the next few months to increase availability and check prices. Chana has 50% share in pulse production in the country and is widely consumed. Reduction in availability of chana impacts the prices of other pulses.

As per consumer affairs ministry data, the average retail prices of chana has increased from Rs 74.7 per kg a year back to Rs 85.8 on June 13 and on Wednesday it stood at Rs 87.6 per kg. Price of tur dal has also increased by around 27% in the past one year, from Rs 126.4 a kg to Rs 160.3 on Wednesday. Similarly, urad dal price has increased by 13.5% in the past one year. However, there is a minor rise in retail prices of masur dal.

Trade sources said govt’s intention to import more chana from Australia has sent the right signal to growers there and this will result in an increase in seeding this year.

As per the agriculture ministry estimate, gram production in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) is estimated at 116 lakh tonne, lower than previous year’s 123 lakh tonne. But traders expect the actual harvest to be lower.

Fall in pulses production and increased consumption has resulted in import of more pulses during the current financial year. Sources said the import has increased to 3.7 lakh tonne in the past two months compared to 3.1 lakh tonne during the corresponding period last year.

India slips 2 notches to 129 in WEF global gender gap index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-slips-2-notches-to-129-in-wef-global-gender-gap-index/articleshow/110949354.cms,"NEW DELHI: India ranked 129 out of 146 countries, two ranks lower than the previous year with a marginally lower score (0.17 points), in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 released by World Economic Forum on Wednesday. With a population of over 1.4 billion, India closed 64.1% of its gender gap in 2024.The global gender gap score in 2024 for all 146 countries stands at 68.5%. “The lack of meaningful, widespread change since the last edition effectively slows down the rate of progress to attain parity. Based on current data, it will take 134 years to reach full parity — roughly five generations beyond the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target,” the report highlights. The Gender Gap Index shows that while no country has achieved full gender parity, 97% of the economies included in this edition have closed more than 60% of their gap, compared to 85% in 2006.Last year, India ranked 127 on the index showing an improvement by 1.4 percentage points and eight positions from 135 in 2022. India had closed 64.3% of the overall gender gap, the 2023 report had observed, marking a partial recovery towards India’s 2020 (66.8%) parity level.On India dropping two rungs in the latest index, the report highlights that “this slight regression is mainly the result of small declines in educational attainment and political empowerment, while economic participation and opportunity slightly improves.”The report noted that parity in educational attainment is well underway, but challenges remain. Updated figures in educational attainment bring India’s parity levels slightly down from prior scores. “While the shares of women are high in primary, secondary and tertiary education enrolments, they have only been modestly increasing, and the gap between men and women’s literacy rate is 17.2 percentage points wide, leaving India ranked 124th on this indicator,” it is stated in the report.In the political empowerment subindex, while India scores within the top 10 on the head-of-state indicator (40.7%), the country’s scores for women’s representation at the federal level, in ministerial positions (6.9%) and in Parliament (17.2%), remain relatively low.The index ranked India's neighbours Bangladesh at 99, China at 106, Nepal at 117, Sri Lanka at 122, Bhutan at 124 and Pakistan at 145. Iceland (93.5%) is again ranked first and has been leading the index for a decade and a half.

“We have seen the reports of that and we have taken it up with the Italian authorities. We understand that a suitable rectification has already taken place,” foreign secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said on Wednesday.

This is not the first time that Mahatma Gandhi’s statue was vandalised in a foreign country.

Jailed BrahMos scientist delivered 80 missiles to forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jailed-brahmos-scientist-delivered-80-missiles-to-forces/articleshow/110949074.cms,"NAGPUR: Former BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal , who was sentenced to life by a sessions court here on June 3 for leaking military secrets to Pakistan, worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur and was involved in delivery of close to 80 missiles to the armed forces during his four-year stint.

He had access to customers and delivery locations of missiles, as per Major General (retd) Achyut Deo, general manager, BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), who deposed as a witness during Nishant's trial.

Last week, Nishant was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court under the IT Act and Official Secrets Act. He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.

Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.

Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.

However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.

Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.
