Usha Chilukuri Vance , an Indian-origin litigator, is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump 's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections on Monday. Usha Vance carries rich Indian cultural values and has a strong legal background, making her a key figure in this political partnership.Usha Vance, daughter of Indian immigrants, is a litigator at a national law firm.She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in History and earned a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

Kumar signed the notice on Saturday night.As such, senior inspector Shailesh Shankhe and his team from Chatushrungi police reached Manorama’s bungalow gates at 10am to hand over the notice but again there was no response from the occupants. The team then pasted the notice on the gates and returned.The notice addressed to Manorama mentions details of the case registered by Paud police and refers to violation of terms of licence in the wake of misuse of the firearm. It further directs her to reply to the notice within 10 days, failing which the licence shall be cancelled.","Pune Police issue show cause notice to trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar's mother over viral gun video.

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Tuesday trained its guns at the Centre after four army personnel, including an officer, were killed in gunfight with heavily armed terrorists in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir. This was the third major encounter between security forces and terrorists in the forests of Doda district in the past three weeks. The Doda incident comes a week after terrorists ambushed an Army patrol in the remote Machedi forest belt in Kathua district killing five soldiers.The border districts of the Jammu region have seen a sudden surge in terror attacks since April this year.12 security personnel, including an Army captain, and 10 civilians have died in attacks while 55 people have been injured in the incidents.While opposition parties expressed concern over Jammu region being targeted by terrorists, Army in a statement said they are committed to eliminate the scourge of terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir for which relentless operations will continue.The Udhampur-based northern command said it has been conducting a series of joint and coordinated operations with Jammu and Kashmir Police to eliminate foreign terrorists who have infiltrated from across the border and are moving in the upper reaches of Udhampur, Doda and Kishtwar districts in Jammu region and thereafter to Kashmir.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge targeted the BJP-led NDA government and said ""The spate of terror attacks that has gripped Jammu and Kashmir in the past 36 days, needs careful recalibration in our security strategy.""""Modi Govt is acting as if everything is ""business as usual"" and nothing has changed. They must know that increasingly Jammu region is bearing the brunt of these attacks. We cannot endanger our national security by indulging in false bravado, fake narratives and high-decibel whitewashing,"" Kharge cautioned.Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi alleged that the soldiers and their families were bearing the brunt of BJP's wrong policies. ""These continuous terrorist attacks are revealing the poor condition of Jammu and Kashmir. Our soldiers and their families are bearing the brunt of the BJP's wrong policies. Every patriotic Indian demands that the government should take full responsibility for the repeated security lapses and take strict action against the culprits who harm the country and the soldiers. In this hour of grief, the entire country stands united against terrorism,"" Rahul posted on X.Delhi cabinet minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj claimed that the Kashmir policy of BJP-led central government had ""completely failed"".PDP president Mehbooba Mufti sought accountability for the ""loss of 50 soldiers in the past 32 months"" in terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.""Soldiers from all over the country come to Kashmir for their duty, but go back in coffins. Who is responsible for this if you say militancy has ended in the valley?... In the last 32 months, especially since this DGP has been appointed, the maximum casualties have taken place... You people guard the borders. So whose responsibility is it to stop infiltration? Is it the responsibility of regional parties?"" Mehbooba Mufti asked the government.""Your narrative has been going on for 6 years, what did you achieve? You have suffered a major setback in North Kashmir,"" she added.""The incumbent DGP is more busy fixing things politically. He is more into how to crush PDP and how to harass the people,"" she alleged and added ""We don't need a 'fixer' here. We need a DGP. We have had DGPs from outside earlier who did a very good job"".AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the terror attack in Doda is very worrying and dangerous as it is way inside the LoC. ""PM Modi used to say 'Ghar mein ghus kar marenge'. What is this then? This is a failure of the government. They are unable to control terrorism. Whatever has happened in Doda is very dangerous,"" Owaisi said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he is ""deeply saddened"" by the death of four Army soldiers in an anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda district and asserted that the security forces are committed to eliminate the scourge of terrorism in the region.Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha strongly condemned the terror attack and said that the death of soldiers at the hands of terrorists will be ""avenged.""""I am deeply anguished to learn about the cowardly attack on our Army soldiers and JKP personnel in Doda district. Tributes to brave soldiers who made supreme sacrifice protecting our nation. My deepest condolences to members of the bereaved families,"" he posted on X.""We will avenge death of our soldiers & thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their associates.

Those arrested included Shiv Kumar, son of Mukhia, Shivam Mandal (Khagaul, Patna), law student Avinash Roshan and driver Sanjay Yadav.

After the previous video of Manorama brandishing a gun went viral, the Pune Rural police last week said a probe would be conducted to ascertain facts, including whether she possessed a licence for the firearm. The incident in the video was about a land parcel bought by Puja's father Dilip Khedkar, a retired Maharashtra government officer, in Dhadwali village in Pune's Mulshi tehsil, an official earlier said.Locals had claimed the Khedkars had encroached on the land of neighbouring farmers. The two-minute video shows Manorama Khedkar, accompanied by her security guards, engaged in a heated argument with the neighbours. She can be seen yelling at a man with a pistol in her hand. She walks up to him and waves the gun in his face before concealing it in her hand. Puja Khedkar, a 2023-batch IAS officer, is accused of posing as an OBC non-creamy layer candidate in her Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) candidature. She also claimed that she was visually and mentally disabled, but refused to take tests to corroborate her claims.She came under the spotlight after reports about her alleged demands for a separate office and official car and unauthorised use of a beacon on her private car during her posting in Pune emerged. She was subsequently transferred to Washim from Pune. However, the government on Tuesday put on hold the district training programme of the controversial IAS officer as she was summoned back to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Uttarakhand's Mussoorie for ""necessary action"".

What started as a regular transfer case after complaints of alleged misuse of power , led to several questions regarding her disability certificate, selection criteria, etc.In a big step, the government on Tuesday put Khedkar's training in Maharashtra on hold and asked her to report back to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration by July 23.Here's how the controversy around trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar unfolded over the past few days.Pooja Khedkar came to the limelight after she was transferred by the Maharashtra government from Pune to Washim following complaints of alleged misuse of power.Amid this, she also used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and VIP number plate. A 'Maharashtra government' board was also installed on her private car. The video, which went viral on social media, captured Khedkar arriving at the Pune Zilla Parishad office in the luxury vehicle with the beacon light flashing.As the viral went viral, the 2023 batch probationary officer was transferred from Pune collector's office to Washim.Officials said she was shifted based on the collector's report that said Khedkar ""sought special privileges, which were not allowed to an IAS probationary officer"".Troubles mounted for Khedkar after Maharashtra OBC welfare minister Atul Save announced a suo motu investigation to scrutinise the claims of Puja Khedkar that she belonged to the OBC non-creamy layer.Khedkar had declared herself as belonging to the OBC non-creamy layer to appear in the UPSC examinations.Save told TOI, ""The social justice department will take cognisance of the matter and conduct a thorough inquiry to ascertain how she obtained the non-creamy layer certificate.""The decision comes in the light of the details of her father Dilip Khedkar's recent Lok Sabha poll affidavit filed as a candidate from Ahmednagar seat which showed assets worth Rs 40 crore. The annual family income threshold for seeking reservation under the OBC non-creamy layer category is set at Rs 8 lakh.Khedkar allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam. Reports indicated that she also submitted a mental illness certificate.In April 2022, she was asked to report to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for verification of her disability certificate but did not comply, citing a Covid-19 infection.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the 'Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)' category.Puja Khedkar, who by now was in the eye of the storm for alleged misuse of power and manipulating disability and OBC quotas, found herself in deeper trouble as discrepancy was found on her part wherein she allegedly used two different names - Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar during civil services exams.In 2019, in her civil services prelims exam, the IAS trainee had registered herself as Khedkar Puja Deeliprao, and her appointment in SAI was also in the same name with Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) (LV) - OBC.However, in her 2022 service allocation by Union Public Services Commission (UPSC), where she was selected for IAS, she went by the name Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar under the PwBD-multiple disabilities (MD) category.In a Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai bench, order dated Feb 23, 2023, her name as the applicant was mentioned as Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar.Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar had in August 2022 simultaneously applied for disability certificates for locomotor disability from District Civil Hospital, Aundh, and Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, Pimpri, both in Pune, report Nisha Nambiar & Swati Shinde Gole.Embroiled in a controversy over the legitimacy of her certificates, Khedkar was alleged to have secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category furnishing a non-creamy layer OBC certificate.Khedkar gained admission through the Association of Management of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges of Maharashtra (AMUPMDC) entrance test, scoring 146 out of 200, said college director Arvind Bhore said Saturday. AMUPMDC no longer exists after NEET’s introduction.Amid heightened media scrutiny of Puja Khedkar, her parents are on the run following the filing of an FIR against them for allegedly threatening a farmer.Separate teams of Pune police visited the Baner bungalow of Puja’s mother, Manorama Khedkar, on Sunday, but received no response despite repeated attempts to make contact.The case was filed on Friday night after a video surfaced showing Manorama Khedkar, accompanied by private bouncers, brandishing a pistol on June 5, last year, during an argument with farmers over a land ownership dispute.On Saturday, police recorded statements from witnesses in Dhadawali and conducted a spot panchnama.At 7 am on Sunday, officials from the Paud police and the Rural police’s local crime branch arrived at Manorama’s bungalow.",Pooja Khedkar came to the limelight after she was transferred by the Maharashtra government from Pune to Washim following complaints of alleged misuse of power.

So proving me guilty by media trial is wrong on everybody's part. The Indian Constitution is based on the fact that you are innocent till proven guilty"" she said.",Puja Khedkar has been in the eye of the storm for alleged misuse of power and manipulating disability and OBC quotas.

"Kanchanjunga Express accident: Drivers of goods train had 30 hours of rest, hit emergency brakes before crash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kanchangunja-express-accident-drivers-of-goods-train-that-had-30-hours-of-rest-hit-emergency-brakes-before-crash/articleshow/111780627.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), probing the reason behind Kanchanjunga Express's fatal collision with a goods train, shared provisional findings highlighting multiple lapses in the signalling and operating procedures that led to the accident .In the findings released on Tuesday, it has been mentioned that the loco pilot and assistant loco pilot of the goods train, which rammed into Kanchanjugha Express killing ten people, had taken a rest for over 30 hours.It has been found in the probe that the goods train was moving at the speed of 75 kmph when the driver applied an emergency break to bring it down to 40 kmph just before the collision.The CRS identified that a ""wrong paper authority"" or T/A 912 to cross defective signals had been issued to the loco pilot of the goods train involved in the crash. The paper authority failed to specify the speed the goods train should adhere to while crossing the defective signal.In the investigation, it was found that besides the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train, five other trains had entered the section after the signals became defective until the accident occurred.The CRS noted that despite issuing the same authority, different speed patterns were followed by the loco pilots, with only the Kanchanjunga Express adhering to the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15 kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal.The CRS emphasised the inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters regarding train operation in automatic signalling territory, creating misinterpretations and misunderstandings of rules.The incident was classified under the ""Error in Train Working"" category.In the probe report, the commissioner has also listed recommendations for the Railway Board, which include bringing uniformity in the standard operating procedure (SOP) for giving paper permits in case of automatic signal failure .It has recommended expediting the rollout of the Kavach mechanism, an anti-collision system which is installed in trains to avert accidents.The report also said that frequent failure of automatic signalling systems is a matter of great concern and needs quick resolution.Ten passengers died and 41 were injured when a fast-moving goods train rear-ended the Kolkata-bound Kanchenjunga Express near Siliguri in north Bengal on June 17 morning.Six of the ten who lost their lives were in the fourth-last bogie, a general compartment. The other three dead were the loco pilot of the goods train; the guard of the passenger train; and a Railway Mail Service official.","Ten passengers died and 41 were injured when a fast-moving goods train rear- ended the Kolkata-bound Kanchenjunga Express near Siliguri in north Bengal on June 17 morning.

An ‘accident-in-waiting’: Kanchanjunga Express report cites multiple-level lapses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-accident-in-waiting-kanchanjunga-express-report-cites-multiple-level-lapses/articleshow/111793932.cms,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Commission of Railway Safety (CRS), in its provisional findings in the Kanchanjunga Express accident that claimed 10 lives, has pointed to wrong authority letters issued to loco pilots on how to negotiate defective signals and lapses at “multiple levels” in train operations following failure of automatic signals.In its report to the Railway Board, CRS grimly noted that this was an “accident-in-waiting”, citing how improper authority letters were issued at the zonal level to loco pilots and that too without adequate information.The report, although provisional, has virtually exonerated the goods train loco pilot Amit Kumar, who was faulted by railway authorities in the immediate wake of the mishap while pointing a finger at ambiguity in rules to be followed in cases of failure of automatic signals, the Rangapani station master and senior authorities in Katihar division.The loco pilot was among those killed in the accident on June 17 in West Bengal's Darjeeling district.The CRS said the ‘paper authority’ issued to loco pilots of trains operating between Rangapani and Chatterhat on that day when automatic signals had failed did not mention the speed limit that drivers were supposed to follow while crossing defective signals. Also, the loco pilot and the train manager were not provided with walkie-talkies which could have ensured better communication.On the role of the loco pilot of the goods train that collided with Kanchanjungha Express, the report said the authority letter (T/A 912) was given to him to pass all the mentioned defective signals without any caution order. “This created an impression in the mind of the loco pilot that all defective signals can be passed at the maximum permissible speed of the section,” it said.The maximum speed of the section was 110 kmph. The goods train was moving at 78 kmph and when the loco pilot applied brakes, he couldn’t decelerate below 40 kmph and ended up rear-ending Kanchanjunga Express, which had stopped.Immediately after the mishap, Railway Board chairperson Jaya Verma Sinha had claimed that Kumar had disregarded signals and this led to the accident.The report pointed out that on the day of the accident, officials should have treated the signalling failure — reported at 5.50am — as a “major signal failure” and followed the ‘automatic block system (ABS)’. In this system, only one train is allowed to stay between two stations. No other train is supposed to enter the stretch until the preceding one has reached the next station.In this case, not declaring ABS meant the station master at Rangapani allowed the goods train to enter the section without confirming with the Chatterhat station master whether Kanchanjungha Express had crossed. The Rangapani station master also issued the wrong authority letter (T/A 912, which does not have any speed restrictions, instead of T/B 912, which limits speed to 25kmph) to loco pilots of the two trains involved in the accident, as well as five other trains preceding them.The railway safety regulator found that besides these two trains, five other trains had entered the section since the signals turned defective on that day, each following different speeds while passing defective signals.“It is evident that the understanding of loco pilots regarding action to be taken when T/A 912 is issued is not clear to them. Some loco pilots have followed the 15kmph rule while most loco pilots did not follow this rule. The absence of proper authority and that too without adequate information created misinterpretation and misunderstanding about the speed to be followed,” the report said.It also mentioned that no caution order was issued to the loco pilots by the station master.As per the findings, only Kanchanjungha Express followed the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal while the remaining six trains, including the goods train, didn’t follow this norm.The report also flagged that there was “inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters” about train operation in automatic signalling territory. It said “ad hocism” was prevalent at the divisional level in issuing the authorities and instructions, and station masters were adopting different procedures.The CRS said in case of multiple signal failures , there were three options left with the rail administration, but they followed none.On the role of others, the report said the control office at the divisional level must be manned by one senior section engineer, one junior engineer and one helper round-the-clock in an eight-hour shift. However, on the night of June 16, the signalling control office was manned by a technician.“It is not possible to manage such a major signalling failure by a staff of technician level. The response of higher officials of the signalling department at the divisional level posted in Katihar has been found lacklustre as despite being informed about this serious failure, none of them went to the control office to manage and coordinate with other departments for timely attention of signalling failures,” it said.","Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) has pointed to wrong authority letters issued to loco pilots on how to negotiate defective signals.

'Fake news will fail': Railway minister Vaishnaw counters Rahul Gandhi's claims on 'poor' condition of loco pilots

Learn about Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's response to Rahul Gandhi's meeting with loco pilots, highlighting improvements in working conditions and recruitment efforts in the railway sector.

NEW DELHI: Raising concern over a large number of signalling failures in “automatic signalling” sections, the Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) has recommended the national transporter to “improve reliability” of the system. Railway Board officials said on Tuesday that a comprehensive action plan is being developed to enhance the reliability and resilience of signalling equipment across the country.The CRS, in its report on the Kanchanjungha Express accident, said that there were 275 failures in the automatic signalling section of just Katihar Division since its commissioning in Jan 2023 to June 20, 2024. It said a large number of signaling failures in the automatic signalling section “is defeating the very purpose of mobility enhancement and causing safety concerns”.Referring to the 208 instances of signal passing at danger (SPAD) between April 2019 and March 2024, out of which 12 cases resulted in collision, the safety regulator said this highlights limitations of preventive measures taken by Zonal Railways (counselling of loco pilot, assistant loco pilots and drives). It has recommended expediting the roll out of anti-train collision system, Kavach.Meanwhile, the Railway Board has instructed all zones to standardise training programmes for loco pilots operating in automatic signalling areas. It has specified one-day intensive counselling sessions based on an automatic signalling system for loco pilots and their assistants every six months.It said the counselling focus should be on working procedures, especially in automatic signalling territories and relevant forms should be issued for abnormal operations with speed restrictions.

Now it is the responsibility of BJP to do more for them in return, compared to what it has done already,"" the Union home minister said.BJP surprised pundits when it won a majority on its own in 2014 on the strength of a social bloc comprising OBCs who flocked to its platform because of their resentment against Jat dominance. The setback in the recent Lok Sabha polls where BJP lost five of the 10 seats has widely been attributed to anger among the dominant Jats who feel disempowered.Shah flagged decisions taken by CM Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC himself, for the community, including raising the creamy layer limit from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. ""Similarly, reservations in panchayats too have been reviewed. There was an 8% reservation for group A but from now on, 5% reservation will be given for group D also. The same is going to be applied to municipalities too. These decisions reflect the policies of PM Narendra Modi,"" Shah said.He recalled that when Modi entered Parliament for the first time in 2014, he said his govt would belong to Dalits, poor and backward classes, which has been delivered in the past 10 years.He thanked people of Haryana for blessing BJP in the 2014, 2019 and 2024 LS elections and also in both assembly polls held during this period.Referring to the nomination of Saini as CM, Shah said BJP had made the son of a backward class family chief minister in Haryana too whereas Congress had given the state nothing other than corruption and casteism.He said BJP gave the nation its first PM from the backward classes. ""Today, out of 71 ministers in his govt, Narendra Modi ji has inducted 27 ministers from backward classes, including two from Haryana,"" he said.",BJP surprised pundits when it won a majority on its own in 2014 on the strength of a social bloc comprising OBCs who flocked to its platform.

Bilaspur bench of Chhattisgarh HC took five years to uphold the trial court verdict and SC another six years to acquit him of murder charges as it found that prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubts.One Ratnu Yadav was arrested on the allegation of forcibly drowning his stepmother on March 2, 2013 at village Kharora, in Raipur.The trial court convicted him on July 9, 2013 through a fast track trial and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

Chitale said postmortem report indicated that the death was due to drowning but the prosecution has not discharged the burden of proving that it was homicidal death.The amicus also pointed out that the witness, the person before whom the accused is claimed to have made an extrajudicial confession, had turned hostile during the trial, thus taking away the credence of the prosecution story that the man forcibly drowned his stepmother.A bench led by Justices A S Oka and Rajesh Bindal said, ""The normal rule of human conduct is that if a person wants to confess to a crime committed by him, he will do so before the person in whom he has implicit faith. It is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant (Yadav) had a close acquaintance with this witness for a certain length of time before the incident. Moreover, the version of the witness in examination-in-chief and cross-examination is entirely different.

In Sept 2021, HC rejected Kunte’s plea stating that transcript is not a public document and cannot be used as evidence.“The learned JMFC in the teeth of this order should not have exhibited the annexures in the form of a transcript of the contents of the CD containing the alleged speech,’’ said Justice Chavan.He said the transcript annexed with Gandhi’s petition was only for limited purpose to quash Kunte’s complaint and cannot be construed as Gandhi’s admission. He also said an accused has “a right has a right to remain silent.” He agreed with Gandhi’s advocates Sudeep Pasbola and Kushal Mor that Kunte has to prove the CD’s contents.It appears from the overall conduct of the respondent (Kunte) that the matter is being unnecessarily delayed and protracted,’’ Justice Chavan added. He also referred to HC’s June 2022 order upholding the magistrate’s refusal to issue witness summons to a notary who had notarised Gandhi’s petition. “It was another unsuccessful attempt to try and get the documents exhibited…,” said Justice Chavan.“Free and fair trial is a sine qua non of Article 21. It is trite that justice should not only be done but it should be seen to be done,’’ he added. He said the “JMFC appears to have completely disregarded the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence while exhibiting the annexures” and also violated HC’s orders. Allowing Gandhi’s petition, Justice Chavan directed the JMFC “to decide and dispose of the complaint as expeditiously as possible given the pendency of ten years.”",Bombay high court slams RSS worker for his attempts to delay trial.
