"Jet, SET, go: Indian DJs now play the hottest parties in the world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jet-set-go-indian-djs-now-play-the-hottest-parties-in-the-world/articleshow/111030810.cms,"Even for those who rave about techno music , the sub-genre of ‘hard techno’ doesn’t make for easy listening. “To be honest, it’s an acquired taste,” admits Kashish, Mumbai-based DJ and producer who goes by the stage name, Kollision. With not much of a fan base at home, she started throwing curated parties. It was at one such party that Kashish hosted a popular British DJ, Sterling Moss. “He liked my work and just like that, I got invited to play last month in one of the most iconic clubs in East London called Fold. It was a dream come true. My next international gig will be in a club in Rome,” says Kashish, who found her calling after a series of odd jobs in call centres, HR, marketing and real estate.From a time not so far away, when one would wonder if mixing songs on a turntable could even qualify as a craft or career, cut to now when Indian DJs are clocking more miles than CEOs. From clubs in the world’s tech no capital Berlin to Roman castles and big fat Indian shaadis across Europe and the US, they’re spinning everywhere, and getting sweaty palms to clap and chant for them.In the early 2000s, Kishore Kumar songs remixed by DJ and composer Aqeel Ali or DJ Aqeel, as he’s better known, threw the dance floor into a frenzy. Most millennials will remember chartbusters like ‘Kehdu Tumhe’ and ‘Tu Tu Hai Wahi’. While much has changed in the last 20 years, Ali is doing rather well for himself.Cut to 2024, he has perfected what he calls ‘ Bollywood Techno ’ and ‘Indohouse’ for an international audience, with his Instagram full of jet-setting updates from New York to Melbourne, where he fills up concert-size venues. In fact, he is the only Indian DJ to play twice at the World Economic Forum in Davos for the likes of Bill Clinton.“Weddings, parties, private shows, concerts, night clubs...I have performed everywhere. For the last year, I have been mixing Bollywood and techno, and even the ‘goras’ like it. After Diljit Dosanjh’s Coachella performance last year, interest in Bollywood music has gone up even more. International clubs, especially in the US and Australia, are hiring more Indian DJs because they have at least one Bollywood night a week,” says Ali on the phone before taking the stage at Vice in Dubai, hoping to get a crowd of 800-1,000.One reason for this is that festival lineups and club scenes throughout the world want to diversify. But visas are a big hurdle, says Mumbai DJ Arjun Vagale. Some of his tracks like ‘She Said’ and ‘Terrakoz’ put him on the global map of electronic music. But having jet-setted across the world, he’s aware of the hoops Indian DJs have to jump through. “Getting a visa is so difficult, and the waiting time has only gone up. It makes more sense for UK and European clubs to spend on local talent or fly down DJs from neighbouring countries than fly in acts from India. It’s pure economics.”No such visa woes plague an Indian wedding DJ, though. Sponsored by rich families who fly a bevy of pandits, caterers, designers and make-up artists, wedding DJs have seen business boom. Gaurav Malvai, who’s been behind the console for 27 years, says, “I am doing an international wedding gig every month now. Indian DJs have the versatility to switch from hard-core Bollywood to hip-hop and house. Foreign DJs don’t have a good grasp of Indian music,” says Malvai, who recently performed at the party thrown by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art at Venice Biennale to mark the opening of a M F Husain show. He also did sets at Reliance scion Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta’s Harry Potter-themed pre-wedding bash and Deepika and Ranveer’s wedding functions in Italy.But some electronic music artists are loath to play at weddings. “You know how a sangeet works. The same track is played 20 or 30 times. The Indian wedding DJ is treated like a jukebox,” says Vagale.Some traverse both worlds with equal ease. Delhi-based DJ Avantika Bakshi, whose dance music blends elements from Arabic, Latin, Indian and African influences, has played in clubs in London, Miami, New York, Berlin and Nepal to NRI weddings and parties for luxury brands. “I had the most amazing time playing in 15th century castles in Rome where I was flown by the Maharaja of Jaipur for his birthday. I have even played at a Mexican wedding,” says Bakshi, who also performed at the Burning Man festival in 2022 and opened for Grammy-winning DJ Black Coffee.Anish Sood aka Anyasa, who has been signed on by Anjunadeep, an independent record label based in London, did a 10-city US tour this spring, followed by appearances in Amsterdam, Mauritius and Bali. He says that being signed to an international label helps. “They already have international audiences. That fast-tracks your music reaching people in different parts of the world,” says Sood, pointing out that aping western DJs, as some Indian acts tend to do, isn’t enough to build an audience.Madhav Shorey, aka Kohra, is another globetrotting DJ and founder of Qilla Records that promotes underground electronic music from India. “The highest figures for our sales are from Europe, and then the US, Brazil and Mexico. The audiences are overseas,” says Shorey.","Indian DJs are clocking more miles than CEOs.

Budhana village

greeted the winner with garlands and dhols, it was also a kick for patriarchy

FIGHTING SPIRIT

WINNING BOUT

Puja Tomar first started fighting out of anger, then for money and finally for respect. The third daughter in a Jat family living in Uttar Pradesh’s Budhana village in Muzaffarnagar, Tomar knew her life was defined by what she was not. She was not a boy and she was not really desired, not by her family, or her relatives and, definitely, not by her community.On June 9, Tomar did something that made everyone change their minds. She made history, not only as the first-ever Indian female fighter to sign up with Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ), but also as the first Indian to win a bout. Dedicating her win to her mother and country, Tomar said, “This is not just my win. This win is for all Indian fans and all Indian fighters who people didn’t think could stand here.”To be fair, her father, a tractor dealer, quickly reconciled to the hand fate had dealt him and loved all three daughters in his own special way. He wanted them to be tough and athletic and ready to face the harsh world. “Main bachpan main sochti thi, sab duniya so rahi hai aur hum daud rahe hain (I used to wonder why we are running when the whole village is asleep),” she recalls now. Tomar’s father died in an accident when she was six and suddenly everything changed. “From being pampered with new clothes to struggling for two meals a day, it was a big shock for our family. But my mother is a very strong person and made sure all of us got an education.”Her older sisters showed academic prowess—one is now a doctor and the other a nurse — but Tomar couldn’t quite see herself hitting the books. She would much rather hit boys instead. “I knew that everyone liked boys more than girls. So, I thought if I beat them up, people will like me,” says Tomar, who watched Jack ie Chan films to pick up some tricks. It helped relieve some of the frustration she felt at the time as relatives bore down on her mother to stop her from going out and hanging around boys. Days would be spent on the small piece of land where the family grew sugarcane, their only source of sustenance.In school, Tomar tried karate, even winning a couple of competitions and honing a deadly sidekick. “I was a street fighter. Lots of strength from hours spent on the farm but no technique,” she adds. Tomar stumbled on martial arts Wushu when she was about 17 and quickly learned to excel in it despite very little guidance or help, picking up five national championship titles. Her mother’s mantra was always on her mind: ‘Darna nahi hai, maarna hai’ (Don’t be scared, fight hard) “I was winning but not earning, and though everyone at home supported me, I knew that there was a fund crunch,” she says. Medical college fees for her sister had meant an additional burden. In 2017, Tomar was offered Rs 50,000 for a mixed martial arts ( MMA ) fight. “All I asked was ‘where?’ I was willing to fight anyone to earn a few bucks,” she recalls.As she grappled, kicked and boxed her way, she was spotted by the Matrix Fight Night (MFN) company promoted by Bollywood star Tiger Shroff, his mother Ayesha and sister Krishna. In 2022, Ayesha Shroff offered to pay for her training at the Soma Fight Club in Bali, Indonesia. Things finally seem to be looking up. “They said I had potential, but I needed to train properly,” Tomar says. So, at 28, Tomar finally found a dedicated coach who corrected her technique, gave her a game plan against her opponents, and monitored her exercise and diet. “Pitte, pitte…peetna seekha.” (After being beaten up several times, I learnt how to outwit others.)In June 2023, Tomar stepped into the ring and won the MFN world championship. “I came back home and gave my mother the championship belt. Again, some boy from the village created trouble. He told her this was a small belt, and that I should bring back the big belt which is the UFC one. He didn’t even let me enjoy my win for a day,” she laughs.Exactly a year later, when she stepped into the Octagon for the UFC bout on June 9, she was fighting for respect. After the second round of the tough 15-minute fight, Tomar felt fatigue creeping and she remembers her coach shaking her, “Ankhen khol aur maar” (Open your eyes and hit). “I just summoned whatever willpower I had.” Her Brazilian opponent Rayanne dos Santos tried to intimidate her by screaming, and Tomar screamed right back. And then landed her signature sidekick sending dos Santos flying across the ring. Her kicks and punches didn’t stop as her coach’s words rang in her ears, “Don’t buckle, keep standing no matter what.” The last five minutes felt like an eternity, Tomar says, as she eked out a 30-27, 27-30, 29-28 split-decision win. “I just collapsed after that,” she says.Her sparring partner of 12 years Himanshu Kaushik says he has never met anyone as strong-willed as her. “It is what has defined her in all these years of struggle,” he says. Post-match, Tomar was treated to pizza “chicken wala with buffalo sauce” which was a sorry substitute for her most favourite thing in the world: sarson ka saag and makki ki roti, but it still felt like the best meal in the world. The 30-year-old has since been busy giving media interviews and dispensing advice to village girls on how to take off on their MMA journey. “They all want to fight now,” she says with obvious pride.And on June 13, Budhana welcomed its daughter, hoping to drown the past judgment it had meted out with garlands and dhols.","Puja Tomar is the first-ever Indian female fighter to sign up with Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ), and the first Indian to win a bout.

Long live longevity! Why everyone is trying to turn the clock back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/long-live-longevity-why-everyone-is-trying-to-turn-the-clock-back/articleshow/111030615.cms,"A greying world has meant a new focus on living longer and healthier. A look at how science and money are coming together in the quest for immortality

The pursuit of ‘forever young’ has never been more popular with people throwing everything at the ticking clock — from ozone therapy and fasting regimens to cold plunges and collagen powder, celery juice to supergummies — whether science backs it or not. But can there really be a cheat code to dodge ageing and death? Turns out, the answer doesn’t matter because people are not going to give up trying.Scientists are bringing their big brains, while tech billionaires — after shaping the cars people drive to the phones they use — are throwing big bucks at projects that could hack the age code and keep the good times rolling a bit longer. According to one estimate, the longevity market is expected to be worth $44 billion by 2030.Some of these ultra-wealthy longevity evangelists include the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Larry Page, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, and Paypal’s Peter Thiel who are investing in slowing ageing at a cellular level. Others like Google cofounder Sergey Brin and Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, and later, Facebook’s first president — are funnelling their dollars into developing revolutionary immune therapies for diseases like cancer and Parkinson’s. Then there are those like Bryan Johnson investing in nutrition, exercise and wellness plans that could break the status quo of the typical ageing process.But using tech and science to outsmart death is no longer just a Silicon Valley obsession. Even in India, where it is considered a luxury to grow old, there is new interest in longevity research. Last month, AIIMS’ geriatric medicine department launched Project Longevity to identify the mechanisms of ageing and ageing patterns in multiple generations within a single family. The project, funded by the Indian Council of MedicalResearch , will last for 36 months. In dian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru launched a Longevity India initiative in April to study the mysteries of ageing. The project will explore factors such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and culture to develop ways to improve the ‘ health span ’ — the length of time a person remains healthy, not just alive — of Indians.“It was high time we did,” says Deepak Saini, convenor of the Longevity India initiative and professor of Developmental Biology and Genetics at IISc. “Unlike the rest of the world, ageing was never a focus for India for the longest time. Our primary health concerns were related to poor nutrition and hygiene. Ageing was considered inevitable, and the common attitude was ‘So what, everyone gets old’.”However, times have changed with better sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics and other medical advances. “We’ve learned to tackle many diseases that cause early death, so now ageing is the next big challenge,” says Saini.The project is currently in its first phase, and the team is doing a large-scale clinical study involving people from a wide range of disciplines, such as clinicians, bioengineers, data scientists, mathematicians, physicists, and others. “We aim to sample 2,000 Indians who are 18 and above over the next two years at various scales to identify biomarkers and organ specific signatures of ageing in Indians,” Saini says, adding that this discovery stage also involves challenging western knowledge and grasp how ageing uniquely affects Indians. “For example, West sees high cholesterol as a problem. But if we use their standards, most Indians would be considered unhealthy because we typically have high cholesterol. Similarly, low vitamin D levels are common among Indians. Is that pathological or just part of our biology? And should we medicate like they do? These are crucial questions,” Saini points out.The Longevity India project has received initial funding from Prashanth Prakash, founding partner, Accel India with interest from individuals, companies as part of their CSR donations and lifestyle and healthcare chains. “To truly do justice to the project and ensure it achieves its intent, we’re looking at anything upwards of Rs 100 crore to keep operations running successfully,” says Saini.So, what’s the plan? “Once we’ve identified the markers, the next step is to develop cost-effective tests. Creating these panels of tests will enable clinicians to predict a person’s health, prescribe maintenance protocols and keep them out of hospital.”And while finances are crucial, the real investment needed, he says, is time and patience. “This isn’t like developing an app where you research today and launch tomorrow. Biological research takes time, and even longer in a physiological context.”At the same time, a shift towards prevention rather than waiting for the wealthy to hack ageing is what cancer surgeon-turned-longevity expert Dr Peter Attia, who recently authored the bestselling ‘Outlive’, advocates. “We already have the tools,” he had told TOI in an earlier interview.“Currently, virtually all investments in this problem focus on molecules, which I believe only represent a fraction of the tools we have at our disposal to live longer — and more importantly, better — lives,” says Attia, whose age-defying prescriptions seem rather simple. Walk, work out, eat healthy, get a good night’s sleep, and maintain social relationships if people “want to be able to hike a mile and a half, or carry their own groceries, or pick up a great-grandchild, or get up if they fall down.”Ageing doesn’t have to follow the clock, points out Saini. “Haven’t you met people who look much older than their years? They may attribute it to a medical episode, infection, disease, or a surgical procedure but it all comes down to the way we use or misuse our bodies over time. It changes the rate at which ageing creeps in,” he says. “See, genetics is something that’s hardwired into your cells. But the physiological code changes daily based on how you eat, sleep, or handle stress. That’s what we’re trying to tackle.”People indeed are already ditching bar-hopping foreign holidays for ‘longevity vacations’ at upscale ‘ anti-ageing ’ centres cropping up from Hawaii and British Columbia to Spain and Greece. These retreats come at a hefty price tag — $1,000 to $100,000 for a program — mostly accessible to the rich who would rather spend it on a few days of slow hiking, forest bathing, taking IV drips and listening to the sound of crystal singing-bowls than heady jaunts that might just fast forward their clock.IISc’s longevity mission, however, is to make sure everyone gets a shot at a longer, healthier life, not just a privileged few. “The motto of IISc is to reach out to the masses so a lot of our data findings are going to be in the public domain and accessible to anyone who wants to make use of the knowledge we’ve generated. The idea is to decentralise the information for everyone’s benefit.”Conversations from a small opinion campaign that the longevity team conducted made one thing clear. “Most people aren’t obsessed with living forever. They want to live healthier,” explains Saini. “However, there were a few ‘oddballs’ who expressed a desire for immortality.”The current cap on human lifespan is 122 years — that’s the age at which the world’s longest living person died. So, could one live that long if everything falls into place — groundbreaking science to lifestyle changes? “No, because everyone’s lifespan is influenced by various factors,” Saini says.And while some superagers may have lucked out genetically, the focus of India’s longevity project is obvious: “To help people achieve their potential lifespan in as healthy a shape as possible. It’s not just about living longer but about living healthier,” he says, quoting a dialogue from the movie ‘Anand’ where Rajesh Khanna’s terminally ill character had famously said: ‘Zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahi,’ (life should be grand, not long).","Scientists are bringing their big brains, while tech billionaires are throwing big bucks at projects that could hack the age code. According to one estimate, the longevity market is expected to be worth $44 billion by 2030. Even in India, where it is considered a luxury to grow old, there is new interest in longevity research.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111030792,imgsize-887933,width-400,resizemode-4/111030792.jpg"
Pakistan ‘handlers’ desperate after setbacks in J&K: DGP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-handlers-desperate-after-setbacks-in-jk-dgp/articleshow/111030580.cms,"Jammu: The four attacks on June 9, 11, and 12 in the three frontier districts of Reasi, Kathua, and Doda in Jammu division were desperate attempts by Pakistani “handlers” of the terrorists to sustain their operations following massive setbacks to the terrorism infrastructure in J&K, DGP RR Swain said Saturday.“The challenge is coming from across the border and they (terrorist handlers) have decided to keep the pot boiling,” Swain said. “They have noticed that the days of terrorism (in J&K) are numbered, given the major setback inflicted on the terrorist infrastructure in Kashmir. How can those, whose bread and butter runs on this, give it up so easily?”Swain, accompanied by Jammu zone ADG Anand Jain, made the statement after visiting Seda Sohal village in Kathua, where a villager was wounded, and two suspected Pakistani terrorists armed with an American M4 carbine and AK-17 rifle were killed in a 15-hour counteroffensive on June 11 and 12.“Sooner or later, terrorists active in J&K will be eliminated, but those involved in sheltering or providing support to these mercenaries would face exemplary punishment,” Swain said, warning people against providing any support to the terrorists.Swain highlighted the desperation of terrorists targeting unarmed people. “As we see, they (terrorists) are not in huge numbers. They are like rats but they exist. They have guns and they are using these on innocent people,” he said.Following the attacks, J&K police are battling a wave of rumours and panic among the public. Viral videos and images on social media, such as a video of a Bolero car with armed men and a photo of a man resembling a terrorist involved in the Reasi bus attack, have caused significant alarm. Police clarified that the vehicle carried Central Armed Police Force personnel and the man in the photo was a harmless local.Police released an advisory, asking people not to spread or believe rumours, but stay vigilant for suspicious activity. DGP Swain also urged people not to raise “false flags” and to verify information about the movement of terrorists before sharing it with security agencies.Authorities have detained over 50 locals for questioning regarding the June 9 ambush on a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Vaishno Devi temple near Teryath village in Pouni area of Reasi district. The attack resulted in nine deaths and 41 injuries as the bus rolled down the hillside. Of those injured, 10 suffered gunshot wounds.“Fifteen critically injured patients were being treated at SMVD Narayana Hospital in Katra. Ten of them have been discharged. The other five are responding well to treatment,” an official said.Police have transferred Pouni SHO Parmodh Singh, citing negligence in acting on intelligence inputs prior to the June 9 attack.Security forces continued their search operations in Doda and Rajouri districts, with no suspects found so far. On June 12, a CRPF constable was killed in a sudden attack on a search team in Doda’s Gandoh area. Earlier that day, five Rashtriya Rifles troopers and a J&K police SPO were wounded in an attack near Chattergala mountain pass in the same district.","Four attacks on June 9, 11, and 12 in the three frontier districts of Reasi, Kathua, and Doda in Jammu division.

T20 World Cup 2024: India's Super 8 Group

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan secured a spot in the Super Eight phase of the 2024 T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea, knocking New Zealand out of the competition. Fazalhaq Farooqi led Afghanistan’s bowling, taking three wickets and contributing to PNG’s total of 95.Despite early losses, Afghanistan chased down the target in 15.1 overs, finishing at 101-3. Gulbadin Naib, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Nabi, with 16 not out, anchored the chase. This win, Afghanistan’s third in a row, guarantees their place alongside hosts West Indies in the next round. Farooqi’s performance brought his tournament wicket tally to 12, four more than his closest rivals, showcasing Afghanistan’s growing prowess in T20 cricket.As the group stage of the tournament edges towards its climax, numerous teams have solidified their positions in the Super Eight. India lead Group A, while Australia secure the top spot in Group B. Afghanistan dominate Group C, and South Africa lead Group D. Bangladesh emerge as a strong contender to claim the second spot from Group D, boasting victories in two out of three matches thus far.Several notable teams face significant challenges to secure their spots in the Super Eight:- New Zealand, and Sri Lanka are out of the T20 World Cup following a run of inconsistent performances in their respective groups.- After their win against Oman, England are in a better position. To advance, they must win their last match against Namibia. Additionally, they need Scotland to lose their final group-stage match to bolster their chances.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 will involve predetermined seedings for the top 8 teams, regardless of their performance in the group stage. This means that even if their rankings differ, their seeding positions will remain the same. In case any of the top 8 teams fail to qualify for the Super 8 stage, the team with the most points will take their spot but will assume the original team's seeding.The teams and their seedings are as follows:Even if the West Indies finish at the top of Group C, they will still hold the C2 seeding. On the other hand, if New Zealand does not qualify, they will nonetheless be designated as C1.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 features two groups, each composed of four teams. The teams are grouped based on their pre-determined seedings, ensuring a competitive mix in each group. Here are the groups for the Super 8 stage:Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)India's position as the top team in Group A (A1) has been solidified according to pre-determined seedings.

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. The nature of that encounter is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid,” said Sullivan.Asked about the issue by reporters accompanying the president, Sullivan said the US will continue to raise the issue, like in the past, at the highest level with India. “We have made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels,” added the official.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region.

Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder. Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played a key role in the case. Girish grilled four men who claimed to be part of the torture squad. The four men said they were offered money to go to jail.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

"We committed to working together on very imp issues, says Trudeau after Modi meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/committed-to-working-together-on-key-issues-trudeau-after-pm-modi-meet/articleshow/111026954.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau committed to working together on “very important issues”, said the Canadian leader after his first meeting with the Indian PM since he publicly alleged Indian government involvement in the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and sent ties into a tailspin.Trudeau seemed cautious in his response to questions about the meeting as he not just refused to confirm if he raised the Nijjar issue but also said it’s important to work with partners even while upholding the rule of law.The leaders had met briefly on the margins of the G7 summit in Italy on Friday. This was confirmed by Modi himself when he posted a photo on social media platform X of the 2 leaders chatting, while holding hands.“I'm not going to get into the details of this important, sensitive issue that we need to follow up, but this was a commitment to work together, in the coming times, to deal with some very important issues,"" he said in a press conference in Italy on Saturday morning. Canada has insisted that its most important issue with India for now is to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Nijjar murder.India continues to officially maintain that Canada has not backed its allegations with any evidence or even information that Indian agencies can look into. The response has been quite a contrast to how India reacted to similar allegations by the US about the alleged involvement of an Indian official - who apparently figures also in the Canadian probe - in a foiled attempt on the life of another Khalistan leader, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, on American soil.The Indian government formed a high-level committee to probe the US allegations saying the information shared by the Americans had a bearing on India’s security too. While India has been silent about the probe findings, discussions are expected on the issue next week as US NSA Jake Sullivan arrives in India for talks. The US has been pushing India to support the Canadian probe too.In the case of Canada, even though senior intelligence officials remain in touch about the probe, Indian government sources say there has been no official or formal communication from Canada on the case, including on the 4 arrests made so far. Expecting perhaps an encounter with Trudeau at G7, the Indian government had said just before the summit its main issue with Canada is political space given to extremists.In his remarks on Saturday, Trudeau also said, “We need to continue to engage with various partners around the world, with various partners, even as we highlight challenges as we stand up for the rule of law”. Trudeau and senior Canadian officials have acknowledged the significance they attach to ties with India, including the role India can play in securing a free and open India-Pacific, but have also insisted that their immediate priority with India is to fix accountability for the killing of Nijjar, a Canadian national.While Trudeau had not acknowledged Modi’s post on X till late on Saturday, his office had confirmed immediately the conversation saying Trudeau congratulated Modi on his re-election and the leaders had a brief discussion on the bilateral relationship. ""Of course there are important issues between our two countries right now. You can appreciate that we won’t be making any further statements at this time,” said a spokesperson.",The leaders had met briefly on the margins of the G7 summit in Italy on Friday. Trudeau seemed cautious in his response to questions about the meeting as he not just refused to confirm if he raised the Nijjar issue but also said it's important to work with partners even while upholding the rule of law.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111027095,imgsize-1441210,width-400,resizemode-4/111027095.jpg"
"Palestine PM writes to PM Modi, seeks India help for Gaza truce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/palestine-pm-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-india-help-for-gaza-truce/articleshow/111026952.cms,"NEW DELHI: Palestine continues to press India to facilitate international efforts for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in war-ravaged Gaza. In a letter congratulating PM Narendra Modi for his third term in office, Palestine PM and foreign minister Mohammad Mustafa said as a global leader and a nation that values human rights and peace, India has a significant role in bringing an end to the ""genocide"" in Gaza.

""It is imperative for India to utilise all diplomatic channels to call for an immediate ceasefire, increase humanitarian aid to Gaza to help alleviate the suffering, collaborate with the international community to ensure the protection and safety of Palestinians civilians, and take a resolute stance against the atrocities being perpetrated,"" said Mustafa.

India backed a UNGA resolution last year seeking an immediate ceasefire but has not explicitly called for the same. In a message to Israel though, Indian govt has been strongly condemning civilian deaths in the Israel-Hamas conflict, while also calling for international humanitarian law to be respected under all circumstances.

Mustafa said the situation in Gaza constitutes a humanitarian catastrophe that demands immediate and decisive action. ""I would like to affirm the importance of advancing our bilateral relations and mutual interests which are based on solid and long lasting foundation. I am confident that these unbreakable ties will continue to strengthen and develop in the years to come,"" he said.

The minister thanked Modi for the ""steadfast support and solidarity"" that he said India has consistently extended towards the Palestinian cause and the rights of the Palestinian people.

G7 Summit commits to promote India-Europe corridor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g7-summit-commits-to-promote-india-europe-corridor/articleshow/111026947.cms,"NEW DELHI: The G7 countries have committed to promoting the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor ( IMEEEC ), in what is seen as a boost to the strategic initiative amid tension in West Asia, which may have delayed work on the project.While the Indian govt has started its end of the work on the initiative that was announced on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit in Delhi last year, there are rail links in Saudi Arabia and some other countries that need to be established.PM Modi attended the meeting as India was a special invitee along with Brazil, Argentina, UAE and Turkiye, among others.The backing for IMEEEC came along with a similar statement of support by G7 for the Lobito Corridor in Central Africa and Luzon Corridor and the Middle Corridor. IMEEEC is to connect ports on India’s west coast to UAE, from where goods are to be shipped by rail to Europe, and potentially open greater access to the African continent.Many experts have argued that the IMEEEC would have helped prevent some of the disruption caused by the tension around the Red Sea and allowed for freer movement of goods to Europe. The Houthi attacks have caused massive disruptions, forcing ships to take a much longer route, delaying shipments by 30 days or more. The G7 members also hit out at the Houthis, condemning their attacks on vessels.“These illegal attacks must end. We call for the immediate release by the Houthis of the Galaxy Leader and its crew. We reiterate the right of countries to defend their vessels, in line with UNSCR 2722 and in accordance with international law… The continuing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea risk destabilising the region, stopping freedom of navigation and trade flows and endangering the UN-led roadmap towards peace in Yemen,” said the communique issued at the end of the meeting in Apulia, Italy.","The G7 countries have committed to promoting the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.

NEW DELHI: Concerned over irregular meetings of the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committees (DISHA), rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to write to all the newly elected MPs to ensure meetings are held to expedite development work on the ground.The Chairperson of a DISHA committee is the senior most MP (Lok Sabha) elected from the district and the meetings of the committee are to be attended by all elected representatives and officials from the district.The issue was discussed at a meeting with officials on Friday evening, as Chouhan reviewed the action plan for the next 100 days of various schemes and emphasized on implementation of the same in an effective manner.Besides this, while discussing the National Social Assistance Programme ( NSAP ), Chouhan has asserted that going forward they will have to structure the project for an “ideal life for the elderly, widows and the disabled, and for this, if there is a need to change the rules and regulations of the scheme, then amendments should also be made.”A significant component of NSAP is focussed on pension for seniors, persons with disabilities and widows, all of whom belong to the Below Poverty Line category. The eligibility criteria and other concerns related to NSAP were discussed at the meeting.During the review Chouhan also emphasized on the importance of the district development coordination and monitoring committees (). The ministry has stressed “there is a need to further strengthen the Disha Committees” and therefore he will write a letter to all the newly elected MPs to request them to ensure that the meetings of these committees are held on time so that problems can be addressed and progress monitored continuously.These committees are formed to ensure better coordination among all the elected representatives in Parliament, state legislatures and local govts like Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipal bodies for efficient and time-bound development. They are supposed to hold quarterly reviews of all development activity at the district level.The DISHA committees have the power to seek information and demand effective follow up on issues raised during the deliberations and the district collector is responsible for ensuring compliance.","Rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to write to all the newly elected MPs to ensure meetings are held to expedite development work.

KCR demands Justice L Narsimha Reddy to set down from commission of inquiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kcr-demands-justice-l-narsimha-reddy-to-set-down-from-commission-of-inquiry/articleshow/111025854.cms,"HYDERABAD: Blaming the commission of inquiry headed by former chief justice of Patna high court Justice L Narsimha Reddy for lacking neutrality , former chief minister and BRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao asked Justice Narsimha Reddy to recuse himself from the responsibility of heading an inquiry commission . He also alleged that the Congress government ordered the commission of inquiry with a clear political motive and also to discredit the earlier govt.“An inquiry of this nature expects the chairman to show and practice neutrality and bring out the truth after examining the issues from different angles. After such an exercise, the report ought to be submitted to responsible persons. But I am constrained to observe that your way of functioning is contrary to the well enunciated principles and processes. It is very clear that you have formed a predetermined opinion that mistakes were committed and it is indicative of your biased view that could be reflected in the final report. It is as if you have determined that a mistake has been committed and now all it remained to calculate the extent of financial loss as per your statements,” KCR said in his letter to the inquiry commission on Saturday.He said “it is as if you are delivering the judgement even before conducting the inquiry and it does not behave the stature of a retired Chief Justice of the Patna High Court. An inescapable conclusion after considering all these facts, is the futility of deposing anything before this commission of inquiry. Hence considering all these facts, I humbly request you to recuse yourself from the responsibilities of heading the commission of inquiry,” the former CM said.The inquiry commission was constituted by the Congress govt in March this year under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 to probe into power purchase agreements (PPA) entered during BRS govt period and also Yadadri and Bhadradri power plants, served notices on the former chief minister to clarity on power purchase agreement with Chattisgarh govt and construction of power plants especially Yadadri which was given on nomination basis.Though the ex-CM asked time till the end of July to submit his argument to the commission, the inquiry commission asked him to submit his oral or written argument or clarification before June 15. On the same day i.e on June 15, he shot off a letter to the inquiry commission raising his objections.“I wanted to submit my reply to the commission by June 15, 2024 as per your notice, but against the conventions of a commission of inquiry, before completing the inquiry, your act of calling for a press conference, taking the name of Telangana state and my name in the press conference and extending the time for submitting the reply in view of the Lok Sabha elections as a personal favour, have caused extreme pain to me,” KCR said.KCR said CM Revanth Reddy when he was MLA of TDP had submitted his objection to procuring the power from Chattisgarh to the Telangana Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Commission had given clearance to the state govt after carefully considering the objections filed.“Enquiry commission could not be constituted against the orders of ERC and the Congress govt chose to constitute the commission of inquiry. “Your taking charge of the commission without informing the govt such inquiry is illegal and that too despite you being former Chief Justice of the High Court is highly regrettable,” he said.He said he was placing his objections on record for your decision to begin the proceedings illegally and without examining the issues in a proper perspective and also making some inappropriate comments against me, KCR said.",Former chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao asked Justice Narsimha Reddy to recuse himself from the responsibility of heading an inquiry commission.
