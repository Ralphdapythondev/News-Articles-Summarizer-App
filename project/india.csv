Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.BRICS Leader's Summit In KazanIndia has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year. The shipments, worth $300 million, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672849,imgsize-99996,width-400,resizemode-4/114672849.jpg"

‘There can’t be neutrality between aggressor & victim. It only means you’re with Russia’: Zelenskyy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/there-cant-be-neutrality-between-aggressor-victim-it-only-means-youre-with-russia-zelenskyy/articleshow/114668253.cms,"What did you think about the Brics summit in

Russia

and PM Modi saying he is ready to work for peace in

Ukraine

at the summit?

Many would argue that sanctions haven’t stopped Russia and more sanctions would cripple the global economy. So how do you convince more countries to your point of view?

Everyone is looking to the US elections and there is a belief that a ceasefire could be reached after the elections. Do you think that’s a possible?

You recently revealed your Victory Plan which includes quick Nato membership for Ukraine. But many countries are divided about your plan. Do you think the plan is practical or is it just a bargaining chip?

Zelensky Questions BRICS Unity After Summit Boosts Vladimir Putin’s Image Amid Ongoing Conflict

hat is the position of the war as of now? Because Russia has been making some gains on the battlefield, and with winter coming many believe you will face a tough few months.

When PM Modi was in Kyiv he along with you visited the Martyrologist Exposition dedicated to the fallen children of this war. Can you detail the overall impact of the war on Ukrainian children?

What can India do specifically to bring back the forcibly deported Ukrainian children?

ICC issued arrest warrants for the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children. But those were not implemented as we saw recently with Mongolia. Do you still have faith in international mechanisms to bring back the children.

Do you think there’s any possibility that PM Modi can host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?

Thank Mr President for speaking to Times of India.

First and foremost the Brics summit in Russia failed. It was a total failure. Not everyone was there, even looking at today’s composition of Brics, we couldn’t see many leaders whom Russia was relying upon within Brics besides the guests. Saudi Arabia wasn’t there at the level of the leader and there was no unity within Brics. I think Brics is divided by Putin himself by his policy of war. And I think Putin’s aim for the summit was to polarise the world and he did not achieve this. He will subvert the Brics’ purpose and use the platform for his own policy of war. That’s why he wants to divide the world into so-called West-plus and Brics-plus. But as of today he has failed to do that for many reasons. First, I think everyone understands that he is a murderer and a terrorist. That today Russia is just a cheap energy resource, and some of the states are using that. But even the states that understand that they can help their economy in this manner, don’t want to spoil the process for themselves with Putin. Plus, Putin is not consistent, and even the proposals of Brazil and China, which were more political and not very specific, were not acceptable to Putin from the perspective of territorial integrity. And for China, I would say, this was a slap on the face. For Brazil too, and that’s why Brazil was not present at the summit at the level of the leader. So Brics in effect did not take place.As for the presence of the UN secretary general, I think that altogether this is a kind of a surrealistic thing. It’s not only about the UN but many other countries. I think that you cannot just say that you are neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine. You cannot be neutral because it would mean you are on the side of Russia. Neutrality really helps just Russia. And between the aggressor and the victim, there cannot be neutrality. I consider this a hidden support for Russia, and the ones who were present there at the summit and speaking about their neutrality and saying they would like to help to solve the conflict, in my opinion, they look more pro-Russia. And that means it’s not about peace because Russia started this war and continues to wage it. And whether they want it or not, or understand it or not, that is not important. This is the fact: neutrality in this war means support for Russia. After all of the victims, after all of the tortures and deportation of Ukrainian children, this is how it looks.As for the position of PM Modi, I think that any assertions today should not end with words only. Modi is the PM of a really huge country from the perspective of population, economy, influence and impact. Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war – we are all interested in that. All of the leaders would tell you that they would like to end the war, even the enemy of peace, Putin, will say that even he wants peace. This is a common thing. Especially for such a huge country like India, PM Modi can influence the end of the war. This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is a huge value of India. Blocking of Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of defence-industrial complex of Russian will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us. Then the G20; the G20 is considered the ‘Great 20’ because they are main economies of the world. And the whole world is looking to them. That’s why the 20 great economies can just easily put Putin in his place and end the war. Not just incentivise but the opposite, slow down all of Putin’s desires. And you don’t need to say we would like peace, you need to act. Because the daily war is killing people.Sanctions are working. Sanctions have led to effect. If the great economies of the world like India, China, Turkiye and others, which did not impose sanctions on Russia, if they would not help Russia survive in the war economically – they actually helped Russia earn money, sometimes even with the understanding that the energy resource they are buying is helping fuel the war – if they re-evaluated their values, then the sanctions would be functioning fully. Now they are working only partially because the world is implementing them partially.So many things depend on the policies of US. But it’s not a deep analysis to say everything depends on US. Many things depend, but not everything. In the beginning of war in Ukraine our nation stood together against the enemy, let me remind you, without the support of allies, including US. The unity of people of Ukraine, our population and society, this is what in fact repelled the attack of the Russians, stopped them. But the occupation, of course, we wouldn’t be able to respond to without the support, or at least it would be very hard because of human losses. And that’s why we are very grateful to our allies for their help and support. But still, not everything depends on US elections. US policies change not only because of the leader. We don’t know who will become the US president, but undoubtedly the bipartisan support for Ukraine will stay. And the US Congress, in any case which we are cooperating with and have developed strong connections, will have its personal impact on this war. The US president will definitely shape the foreign policy because it’s his or her constitutional obligation. And undoubtedly if US policy changes and it says we don’t support Ukraine in its sovereign and just protection of its territories, it will be really hard for us. This is if the policy totally changes. Then we will think what we will do with that. Definitely not now, we will think on that only then.Another argument is that we shouldn’t forget that Europe is a powerful continent on its own. In fact, India and China shouldn’t forget about that in spite of the fact that India and China are great economies, still Europe is five times bigger than Russia by population and dozens of times bigger economically. Hence, Europe is a more attractive market. So we need to understand that US population is half the population of Europe. And we need to understand that Europe as it is, when it is not divided, is powerful. It is important for us to preserve this unity in Europe, and not to change the policy of Europe about this war. This is the second aspect. And the third about the ceasefire, we need to understand that we are against a frozen conflict, we don’t want the third war. Because in 2014, one war started, and our territories were occupied. In 2022, the full-scale war started, though before 2022 we used to have a frozen conflict. There was a ceasefire already. There were Normandy and Minsk processes where there were dozens of negotiations with Russia and other partners in different platforms. And then we had the full-scale war. So if now freeze the conflict without a proper understanding of what will happen tomorrow, which guarantees of security the Ukrainian people will have, our children will have, then I think it is a huge risk, a very high risk. Everything should be done on paper and should be comprehensible. How this war ends, and who and how much will bear responsibility for it? Definitely the aggressor will do that.The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia. Let’s not confuse this. The Victory Plan is not a platform for response for all of the countries of the world. The Victory Plan is the plan for strengthening Ukraine today. Strengthening of Ukraine before heading into those diplomatic formats of negotiations, peace summits, so that Ukraine could be strong. That’s why the Victory Plan is given to countries who are ready to strengthen Ukraine. It’s not about talks with Russia, because Russia is not making us stronger, it’s making us weaker. It’s not a proposal for negotiations. This is a request, very specific one. I shouldn’t ‘ask’ in my Victor Plan . As for the invitation to Nato – I would like that people don’t misunderstand this – the first point is not Nato membership or quick membership of Nato. The first point is invitation to Nato so that in the future nobody can change their opinion. Everything shouldn’t be just in words, but documented in papers, fundamentally and legally. We are talking about invitation, not membership, because during the war we cannot become Nato member obviously. And this point is only for the Nato countries because we would like to be invited to Nato.The second point of the Victory Plan is strengthening the Ukrainian army with weapons today at the battlefield, not tomorrow. We are not talking with Putin about that or the countries of the Global South who do not strengthen us with weapons today. We speak about this with the Ramstein countries which helped Ukraine with weapons during this conflict. Point three is about the package of deterrence against Russia. It does not mean the use of missiles. However, this would be just because Russia is using missiles against us. But we are saying that it’s not about the use of missiles but deterrence of Russia. This is the package of long-range weapons which Ukraine will not use if Russia stops the war against us. Stops the aggression against us. Stops killing our people. That is why this package of long-range weapons should be in Ukraine. This is the prevention measure of weapons. This is the warning for Russia. Stop killing people. The aggressor needs to stop. And that’s why this point of the plan is not for everyone, not even for all of the countries of Ramstein. This point is only for those countries who have certain types of weapons. Who have and who are ready to give it to Ukraine.The fourth point, the economic one, is for the ones who are interested in investments in Ukraine, to protect mineral resources of Ukraine, and to create businesses in future together with Ukraine. The fifth point is about just security of the European continent. And that’s why this is the post-war point. It tells us what will happen after the war with the Ukrainian army as part of the security of Europe. And it is exclusively about Europe. So it is not the plan that will end the war where we unite the whole world. This is the plan of victory that leads us to the plan to end the war. This is the plan of strengthening of Ukraine.Well, this is the third hard winter for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Russia is doing the same thing every year of this war. We are studying how to protect ourselves. Russia attacked our energy centres since the very beginning to breed chaos in Ukraine, so that our people would starve, so that our people will be ill without having the opportunity to provide insolation and winterisation of their houses. So that the people would die. We as a state started to oppose that. We restored our energy systems. We are step-by-step strengthening the protection of our energy systems. And we aren’t just allowing Russia to kill our people. Gradually we have begun to cope with their attacks on our energy systems. We know how to retaliate to their strikes, but we do that very cautiously. We never target the people, we never target the schools and universities – which Russia does. So they have felt that Ukraine can respond. And in those operations none of our partners have helped us. This is what we have done alone in our response, unfortunately.As for the battlefield, you are right, Russia has more people and more weapons. In many directions, technologically, we are better than them already. Many partners agree with that, especially in long-range drones, systems of electronic warfare etc. But it’s not enough because the most important thing is to save the people. So we look at the battlefield from the perspective of how to save our people. We can lose equipment, we can lose technologies, but we should minimise human losses. Sometimes by the price of metres or few kilometres of land. Yes, the human being is more important than the land, though this is our land. But our land will be brought back later, but we will not be able to bring back the human being. And we live according to this law. It is hard to be at war with Russia by this law because they have a different law – if they are not attacking, if their soldiers are not on the offensive, they are shot by the Russians themselves. Russians are killed by Russians. The Russians have killed many of their own mobilised soldiers just because these soldiers were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets or to be wounded. So they retreated and this is where they were killed by their own army. This is their law of war. They don’t quantify, they don’t calculate the numbers. They have approximately 650,000 victims already who were killed or wounded in Russia. Just imagine, that’s a lot.And you know what’s really scary? The same is continuing and they don’t even retrieve the bodies. The bodies are just rotting on the battlefield, they don’t take them back. This is the face of today’s Russia, today’s Putin. And what’s more interesting, yes they are having gains in Ukraine’s east because of this strategy, because of this meat-grinder, because they are throwing bodies onto us. But when we came to Kursk region and had a preventive attack against their territory, because they wanted to have a separate operation and occupy our north, we can see that they are attacking their own territory. They are themselves killing their own civilians in Kursk. And our people are giving them food and water because they are civilians not soldiers. Our soldiers are giving away and sharing what they have. And we can see the bodies of Russian civilians, civilians who were shot by Russian artillery. This is the war.First of all I thank PM Modi who joined me and commemorated the perished children. You know the real number of Ukrainian children who have been killed in the war is unknown. Nobody knows the real number, unfortunately. We can definitely state that dozens of thousands of children were deported and kidnapped by Russia. But how many of them were killed, we will only get to know after the war. Dozens of thousands of deported children. Thousands with changed names and surnames. They have been forced to speak a different language. Many of them who were teens, they have been forced to the battlefield to fight against their own country. This is just horrible. Their relatives don’t have their children back. And unfortunately, with dozens of thousands having been kidnapped, less than 1,000 have been brought back. That’s why it’s very important that many countries join the coalition to bring back Ukrainian children. We would really like India to help with this. Today, the coalition is working with more than 40 countries. But unfortunately, not many countries have managed to bring back our children.Besides this, many children have been affected by the war in Ukraine. Schools have been hit, universities have been hit. Many children have been wounded, many have lost their limbs, and many children have been killed. Many children have left Ukraine with their parents. You know that more than 7 million Ukrainians are now abroad. A big number of them are children. Their parents are staying sometimes here. For instance, the men in the family are left here or they are on the frontline of the war. And their children are being deprived of their childhood. Some of those fathers are dying in the war. This is the situation about the children.You can join the coalition to bring back Ukrainian children. You can support the joint communique of the Peace Summit because the third point was about bringing back the children, you can call Putin and ask him who he is, you can force him to bring the children back, PM Modi can do that because he really has huge influence, he can just say specifically how many Ukrainian children will be given to me so that I could bring them back to Ukraine, just say that directly, just give me 1,000 Ukrainian children who will be brought back to Ukraine. This is the real step. Putin took dozens of thousands. Let PM Modi bring back only 1,000 at least. And if every such influential person as PM Modi is able to bring back 1,000, we will be able to bring back the majority of our children. That’s what is needed to be done. You need to raise this issue at the meeting of G20. India can invite us to this meeting as well together with Brazil. So the G20 can divide the obligations. If 20,000 of Ukrainian children are deported, every leader should take the responsibility to bring back 1,000 children. It’s not just to sit at the table during this summit but to really help the children. The world should be helping.We believe just in the international law. We believe in the international influence of the leaders. We believe in the international mechanism. You are right, just one mechanism, just one international criminal court cannot fully correct the situation. It cannot fully influence Putin and his allies. But all of them together, the ICC, the leaders, international law, UN, G20, altogether can definitely end this war. But the results of the ICC are still felt. Putin is not travelling to the majority of world countries. We can see that. The majority of the leaders who acknowledged and approved the Rome Statute, and still acknowledge the verdict of the ICC, the majority of them try not to visit Putin. Remember, this (the deportation of children) is only the first case of war crimes. There will be many more cases for which more evidence will be provided. As for Mongolia, unfortunately it showed that it is not an independent country.As for PM Modi, we have the platform which is the Peace Summit. The second Peace Summit could be conducted in any respected capital and we communicated that it could be held in New Delhi. Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that if he can organise a certain summit. But for that we need to prepare ourselves in terms of the proposals on which any number of countries could be heard – the proposals of India, EU, the African continent etc. So if Brazil and China would like to see us as well and they have proposals, please by all means, but only according to our format because the war is in our land. So I think that such a summit can be hosted in India.Thank you and I wish the people of India peace. This is really important.","India's Prime Minister spoke to Times of India about the conflict in Ukraine.

“PM Modi can influence the end of the Ukraine war . This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is the huge value of India,” said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an exclusive interview to the Times of India. When asked about the possibility of PM Modi holding negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Zelenskyy gave his strongest signal yet, “Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that… but I think we need to prepare ourselves … and only according to our format because the war is in our land… we have the platform which is the peace summit.”Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region. Add to this the uncertainty posed by the upcoming presidential elections in US where a Trump victory might see Kyiv lose vital American support. Washington is Kyiv’s biggest source of military aid and any cut in this support will be a huge setback for Ukraine. Kyiv already faces restrictions in using American supplied long-range weapons to hit Russian military targets deep inside Russia. With winter coming and Russia continuing to hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Kyiv is looking at another bleak few months.“This is the third hard winter for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people… We are step-by-step strengthening our energy systems and aren’t just going to allow Russia to kill our people,” said Zelenskyy. Asked about his recently revealed Victory Plan and Nato membership for Ukraine, Zelenskyy emphasised that it was a bid to strengthen Ukraine as a bridge to peace negotiations to end the war. “The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia… We are not asking for quick Nato membership because that is not possible during the war … What we are asking for is invitation to Nato so that in the future nobody can change their opinion.”Zelenskyy was also critical about the recent Brics summit in Russia calling it a failure and citing the absence of some countries at the leaders’ level including those from Saudi Arabia and Brazil. “Putin wants to divide the world into so-called West-plus and Brics-plus… Even the (peace) proposals of Brazil and China were not acceptable to him… This was a slap for China and Brazil.”On Modi’s statement that he is ready to work to bring peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for action, not mere words. “Modi is the PM of a really huge country… Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war… PM Modi can influence the end of the war… blocking of Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of defence-industrial complex of Russia will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us.”Specifically, Zelenskyy asked Modi for help to bring back Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, “You can force Putin to bring back Ukrainian children… PM Modi can use his influence and tell Putin just give me 1,000 Ukrainian children who will be brought back to Ukraine. Let PM Modi bring back at least 1,000 Ukrainian children.”",Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane load of illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.",The deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility.

Flight hoax threats persist as over 50 flights targeted in a day; government plans tough action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flight-hoax-threats-persist-as-over-50-flights-targeted-in-a-day-government-plans-tough-action/articleshow/114657609.cms,"Representative image.

NEW DELHI: Hoax threats to flights of Indian carriers continue unabated, even a fortnight after this wave began. On Sunday, nearly 50 flights from various airlines, including IndiGo, Vistara , and Akasa , received threats. IndiGo alone confirmed receiving “security-related alerts” for 18 flights. Two of these flights — Pune-Jodhpur (6E 133) and Kozhikode-Dammam (6E 87) — had to be diverted to Ahmedabad and Mumbai, respectively. In the last 15 days, over 350 flights have received such hoax messages, leading to significant financial losses for airlines and causing delays for passengers.Last Friday, the government instructed social media intermediaries like X and Meta to curb this misinformation and warned of strict action if they failed to do so. However, the issue persists.Union Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu said on Sunday: “We are also seeking support from international agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the Intelligence Bureau to prevent these incidents. We are planning to amend two civil aviation laws. Those responsible for such activities will face severe penalties. We are also taking steps to ban such individuals from flying. We will announce further measures in the coming days,” he added.Meanwhile, airlines and passengers remain in a state of uncertainty due to these ongoing threats. “In line with our strict safety protocols, all necessary precautions are being taken, and we are working closely with the relevant authorities. The safety and security of our customers and crew remain our highest priority. We regret any inconvenience caused to our customers and appreciate their understanding during this time,” IndiGo said in a statement.Vistara stated: “We confirm that a few of Vistara’s flights operating on Oct 27, 2024, received security threats on social media. We immediately alerted the relevant authorities and are following all security procedures as directed by them. At Vistara, the safety and security of our customers, crew, and aircraft are of utmost importance.”Akasa posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Some of our flights operating on Oct 27, 2024, received security alerts. The Akasa Air emergency response team is monitoring the situation and is in contact with security and regulatory authorities.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

This is the issue of disengagement and patrolling which meant our armies had come very close to each other, and now they have gone back to their bases.

Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, Jaishankar confirmed that a consensus had been achieved on the disengagement and patrolling protocols in Depsang and Demchok.Jaishankar further elaborated on this process during an interactive session at an event in Pune and said that both military and diplomatic efforts were instrumental in reaching this stage.""Since 2020, the situation on the border has been very disturbed, and that's had a very negative impact on the overall relationship. Since September 2020, we have been negotiating with the Chinese on how to find a solution,"" Jaishankar said.He said the three key issues tackled in these negotiations: disengagement, de-escalation, and a framework for future border management .""The first and 'most pressing one' being disengagement as the troops of both countries are 'very, very close up to each other, and the possibility of something happening is there,"" he stated. Following disengagement, the next priority is de-escalation, with the final step being the establishment of a sustainable border management strategy.Reflecting on the efforts to reach this point, Jaishankar acknowledged the need for patience in rebuilding trust between the two nations. ""Because after four years of a very disturbed border, where peace and tranquillity have really been shattered, it will take naturally time to sort of rebuild a degree of trust and a willingness to work with each other,"" he remarked, adding that improved border infrastructure has also played a role in reaching the present agreement.With the current disengagement and patrolling protocols in place, India is cautiously optimistic about progress, though Jaishankar reiterated that future de-escalation would depend on reciprocal actions from China.","S Jaishankar said the disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh is the initial step towards restoring normalcy along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) The next phase, he said, involves de-escalation, which will proceed only when India is assured that similar steps are taken by China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114659435,imgsize-677870,width-400,resizemode-4/114659435.jpg"

The feud between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry is not a hidden fact. In 2016, Ratan Tata removed Cyrus Mistry as the Chairman of Tata Sons According to a newly released biography titled ""Ratan Tata: A Life,"" authored by Thomas Mathew, Ratan Tata began to question Cyrus Mistry's suitability as the chairman-designate of Tata Sons by the end of the first year of Mistry's apprenticeship under him.The apprenticeship was intended to provide Mistry with insights and hands-on experience on how to run the group before he formally took over the position, PTI reported.The book reveals that when Mistry was chosen to succeed Tata in 2011, Tata had two observations. First, he wanted Mistry to ""severe all relations"" with his family's company, Shapoorji Pallonji Group , to create a ""legal and tenable"" separation. Second, he wanted Mistry to undergo a year of ""parallel running"" with Tata to gain insights and experience in running the Tata Group However, by the end of the year, Tata began to have doubts about Mistry's suitability. According to the book, Tata was surprised by some of Mistry's ""sharp interventions"" and wondered if Mistry's ethos could potentially conflict with that of the Tatas. Tata later lamented that he did not have the opportunity to fully assess Mistry before his appointment.Mistry's removal in October 2016 was a painful and difficult decision for Tata, according to the book. Nitin Nohria, former dean of Harvard Business School, who was chosen by Tata to help Mistry succeed, said that Mistry's removal ""in some way"" was the ""most painful and difficult thing for Ratan."" Similarly, Venu Srinivasan, director of Tata Sons and Chairman Emeritus of TVS Motor Company, said, ""Ratan suffered more than Cyrus in a way, people may not quite understand or accept it and for Cyrus it is certainly something he would not accept or believe but the truth is I think he (Tata) took a lot of suffering, on that score.""Tata wished that Mistry ""should have been more dignified and graciously resigned after it became clear that he had lost the confidence of the directors."" According to the book, Tata said, ""Even for me, firing him this way was not our style of doing things. Our lawyers said that if it is not a surgical strike, he would go to the court and litigations would follow.""","Ratan Tata began to question Cyrus Mistry's suitability as the chairman- designate of Tata Sons by the end of the first year of his apprenticeship.

The 1997 batch officer was ousted as the NTA chief in June amid controversy over alleged irregularities in NEET and NET exams and put on compulsory wait. The Supreme Court has concluded that the data provided by NTA and others did not substantiate claims of a systemic leak or widespread fraud sufficient to invalidate the exam results.In the case of repatriation of Joshi, the ACC in its order said that he has been repatriated “on request” of Haryana govt. He is the second officer from his batch who has been sent to the state to become chief secretary. Incumbent chief secretary T V S N Prasad is retiring on October 31. With Joshi’s repatriation, now two secretary level posts in DoPT and culture ministry are vacant, which the govt may fill soon. Joshi was appointed DoPT secretary in August.Though Joshi’s repatriation was waiting to happen, the order came just days after the Uttarakhand High Court issued a notice to the DoPT secretary in a contempt case filed by a forest officer alleging that the secretary wilfully defied a court order to give the record relating to the process and decision making of empanelment of the petitioner at the level of joint secretary.In recent years, the govt has repatriated many secretaries in the central govt to states and they have been posted as chief secretaries in BJP governed states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.",The appointments committee of cabinet (ACC) also approved posting of eight additional secretary level officers. The 1997 batch officer was ousted as the NTA chief in June amid controversy over alleged irregularities in NEET and NET exams. The Supreme Court has concluded that the data provided by NTA and others did not substantiate claims of a systemic leak or widespread fraud.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114652760,imgsize-961561,width-400,resizemode-4/114652760.jpg"

Govt will have to decide on 4 key appointments soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-will-have-to-decide-on-4-key-appointments-soon/articleshow/114666821.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre will have to decide on four key appointments in as many months, starting with a replacement for G S Murmu, whose term as Comptroller and Auditor General is due to end in November. A trusted Modi government bureaucrat is likely to bag the coveted assignment to keep a watch over the Centre’s spending and accounts.While Murmu can’t be given a fresh term, the other three incumbents — Reserve Bank of India governor, chief economic adviser and Sebi chairperson — can be reappointed. After CAG, govt has to decide if it wants to give another stint to Shaktikanta Das in Dec or look for a replacement for the crucial job on Mumbai’s Mint Road.Das, a former civil servant, was given a three-year term in December 2018 after Urjit Patel’s sudden resignation following a bitter tussle with govt. Das was given a second term three years ago and is widely seen to have managed the financial sector well and has had a smooth relationship with the Centre, something his two predecessors could not manage.A month after the RBI appointment, govt will be faced with the same question on whether to continue with chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran. Given that the budget exercise kicks off in the next few weeks, govt may decide earlier if its top economist is likely to get a fresh term. The CEA provides crucial technical inputs for the budget and also authors the Economic Survey along with his colleagues in the finance ministry’s economic division.The fourth job, that of Sebi chief, is likely to pose the biggest dilemma for the govt given the controversy around Madhabi Puri Buch, the first woman and the first from the private sector to head the regulatory agency. Puri Buch has faced allegations of impropriety and conflict of interest, charges she has denied, amid chatter in govt over how civil servants are best suited to take up such regulatory assignments.On March 1, 2022, the former banker was named Sebi chief for three years and is eligible for a fresh term. At least three of her predecessors G N Bajpai, M Damodaran and C B Bhave have had three-year stints.","G S Murmu's term as Comptroller and Auditor General is due to end in November.

"US, France & Armenia top three buyers of Indian defence exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-france-armenia-top-three-buyers-of-indian-defence-exports/articleshow/114666748.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India shedding its hesitations in exporting lethal arms to other countries, Armenia has emerged as its biggest client of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, among others.The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India, which chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24, official sources said on Sunday.Indian public and private sector companies are now exporting a wide range of arms, ammunition and fuses to around 100 countries, which also include some complete weapon systems and platforms like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Dornier-228 aircraft, artillery guns, radars, Akash missiles , Pinaka rockets, and armoured vehicles, the sources added.The exports to the US, however, mainly consist of sub-systems and components, which include global defence majors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin sourcing fuselage, wings, and other parts of aircraft and helicopters from India as part of their global supply chain networks as well as offset commitments.The Tata Boeing Aerospace venture in Hyderabad, for instance, is making the fuselage and secondary structures for Apache attack helicopters. “France, in turn, is importing a lot of software and electronic equipment,” a source said.The former Soviet Republic of Armenia, on its part, has inked a flurry of deals with India over the last four years for import of ‘finished products’ like missiles, artillery guns, rocket systems, weapon-locating radars, bullet-proof vests, and night-vision equipment as well as a wide variety of ammunition and artillery shells. Some of these deals were inked even during Armenia’s clash with Azerbaijan — which has close ties with Turkey and Pakistan — over Nagorno-Karabakh, as reported by TOI earlier.Armenia has become the first foreign customer for the indigenously-developed Akash air defence missiles, which have an interception range of 25 km, while other countries like Brazil are even keen on co-production and co-development of advanced versions of the system. “Brazil wants an inter-governmental agreement on it…talks are underway,” another source said.Similarly, after India clinched the $375-million contract in Jan 2022 for the export of three BrahMos anti-ship coastal missile batteries to the Philippines, other Asean countries as well as some Gulf nations are increasingly showing interest in acquiring the precision-strike missiles that India has co-developed with Russia.India, of course, continues to remain in the strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 9.8% of the total global imports in the 2019-2023 time-frame.The country, however, is now progressively expanding its domestic defence-industrial base (DIB) and banning import of some weapon systems under the drive for ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) or ‘Make in India’, while aggressively pushing arms exports.With India’s annual defence production reaching a record high of Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2023-24, the govt has set an ambitious target for it to touch Rs 3 lakh crore by 2028-29, along with arms exports of Rs 50,000 crore.India’s defence-industrial base, apart from the 16 defence PSUs, has now expanded to over 430 licenced companies and 16,000 MSMEs, with around three times increase in value of production since 2014-15. The private sector’s contribution amounts to 21% in this, the official sources said.","The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India.

The three steps to digital security are: stop, think and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No govt agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,” he said, adding that investigating agencies were working in partnership with state govts to combat the scam being carried out in the name of ‘digital arrest’ but awareness was essential in protecting oneself from such fraudsters.“As soon as you get a call, stop... don’t panic, stay calm, don’t take any hasty steps, don’t give away your personal information to anyone; if possible, take a screenshot and record it for sure. The first step is ‘stop’ and the second step is ‘think’. No govt agency threatens you on the phone like this, neither inquires nor demands money on a video call like this,” Modi said.The third step was ‘take action’, the PM said and urged victims to dial the national cyber helpline 1930 and also report such incidents on cybercrime.gov.in. He urged people to inform family and police, and preserve evidence by recording the fraud call.During his broadcast, he also shared a conversation between a victim and a fraudster to highlight the ‘digital arrest’ scam.“The fraudsters of digital arrest phone calls, at times impersonate as police, CBI, narcotics, at times RBI... using such various labels, they converse as fake officers with a lot of confidence. Many listeners of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ have wished that we must discuss that,” Modi said.He reiterated that there was no system like digital arrest in the law and this was just a fraud, deceit and a lie. The gang of criminals and those who doing this are enemies of society, Modi said.Modi also said the effort for an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ was making strides in every sector, noting that the country was exporting its defence products to over 85 countries now.","PM Narendra Modi flagged the issue of fraudsters targeting people through ‘ digital arrests ’ as he clarified that no govt agency threatened individuals over the phone or demanded money.
