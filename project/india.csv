"Thirty-nine untapped drains a big challenge ahead of 2025 Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, NMCG steps in to fix the gap",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thirty-nine-untapped-drains-a-big-challenge-ahead-of-2025-maha-kumbh-in-prayagraj-nmcg-steps-in-to-fix-the-gap/articleshow/112792825.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Prayagraj gears up for Maha Kumbh next year, 39 untapped drains out of a total 81 that flow into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in the city have remained a big challenge to maintain cleanliness during the mega event scheduled for January 14 to February 26.Sensing the urgency, the National Mission for Clean Ganga ( NMCG ) — a central agency that implements the Ganga rejuvenation plan - has sanctioned three new sewage treatment plant (STP) projects at an estimated cost of Rs 987 crore to significantly increase the sewage treatment capacity of the city and been working with local authorities to intercept and divert the untapped drains.Multiple other activities, including a detailed sanitation plan and use remote sensing and GIS technologies to map the impact of the temporary population on sewerage infrastructure and river water quality during Maha Kumbh, have also been taken up to make it a memorable event for crores of visitors at Sangam during Jan-Feb 2025.Currently, the city has a combined sewage treatment capacity of 340 million litres per day (MLD) against generation of around 500 MLD. This means 160 MLD of untreated sewage is being discharged into the rivers Ganga and Yamuna. ""This is exactly why the three new STPs have been sanctioned as these projects will increase the city's total sewage treatment capacity to 523 MLD,"" said an NMCG official.The new STPs will come up at Salori (capacity of 43 MLD with a of Rs 325 crore), at Rasoolabad (capacity of 90 MLD with a cost of Rs 476 crore) and at Naini (capacity of 50 MLD with a cost of Rs 186 crore).Since tapping the drains would be important to keep the rivers clean for the holy dip, the executive committee of the NMCG, headed by its director general Rajeev Kumar Mital, had last month sanctioned remediation of 22 untapped drains during the Maha Kumbh period at an estimated cost of over Rs 55 crore. Remaining 17 untapped drains will be managed by the local authorities, using the Maha Kumbh 2025 budget.Under the detailed sanitation plan, the NMCG through its 'Namami Gange' programme has decided deployment of 1.45 lakh community toilets, 20,000 urinals and a number of prefabricated steel toilets and solid waste bins across the city. In addition, five ghats and two crematoria have been constructed to ensure cleanliness and sanitation during the mega event.",39 untapped drains out of a total 81 that flow into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in the city have remained a big challenge to maintain cleanliness.

GenAI will ensure strong hiring growth: Infosys CEO Parekh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/genai-will-ensure-strong-hiring-growth-infosys-ceo-parekh/articleshow/112787130.cms,"When do you see this low single-digit growth environment changing? Hiring too has been very weak. Is it primarily because of global macro conditions?

The American economy is seen to have been relatively strong for some time. Yet, there is this demand slowdown for IT…

In 2015, Infosys had funded OpenAI and ANSR (GCC consultancy and solutions company). But it subsequently did not take that forward or divested. Today, the two words everyone in the Indian tech industry are talking about are AI and GCC. Very recently, Accenture invested a big amount in ANSR. Did you miss the bus on those two opportunities?

There are GCCs that say it’s more efficient to do tech in a GCC, than with an IT services partner. Several seem to be bringing more and more work in-house. They also seem to want to do cutting-edge tech like GenAI themselves, instead of giving it to IT services players. They seem to be taking over the higher value work.

How do you see your progress with GenAI? Where is it having the biggest impact?

Can you provide metrics of improvements in areas where GenAI is being applied?

Nilekani spoke about how AI doomerism has quietened down. With his tech evangelism and boardroom connections and your soft power leadership, how are you rallying forces, especially on the sales and delivery side, to become an AI-first enterprise?

Infosys is in the leaderboard quadrant in terms of use cases for GenAI. Some of your peers have called out the pipeline for GenAI, even though it’s not converted into revenue yet. When do you think you'll move away from POCs to seeing revenues trickle into the books?

But the split between traditional AI and Gen AI, do you think there's value in calling them out separately?

How comfortable are enterprises with chatbots? There are hallucination issues.

How do you position yourself against the big four? They straddle the entire spectrum, while companies like yours predominantly do technology work.

Cybersecurity is a boardroom agenda. In your annual report, you've disclosed how Infosys is under-covered for cybersecurity insurance. Do you want to increase that coverage?

Is there a truce after the GST pre-showcause GST tax notice?

BENGALURU: Salil Parekh looks trim and fit. When we ask him about it, the Infosys CEO & MD says he isn’t getting as much time for fitness as he would like. Infosys probably requires more of his time now. The company, and its peers, are going through a lean phase. Revenue growth is in low single digits for the biggest companies, though the last quarter showed signs of incipient recovery.Global capability centres (tech & operations arms of MNCs) in India look to be taking away business that previously went to IT services partners. AI is disrupting all businesses. Nine years ago, Infosys was the company that invested in GenAI pioneer OpenAI and a GCC consulting company, only to abandon those initiatives two years later. Big miss? In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Parekh answers this and more.I think employee growth is going to be very strong. GenAI is giving us new areas where we can do projects. So, while there are some areas for improvements, overall, we see a positive revenue impact on growth. We’ve called out a guidance of 3% to 4% for the full financial year. We don't have a view at least of what the next financial year will look like in terms of growth. Broadly, we have extremely talented people in India, so I don't see how anyone can really compete with that.Large tech projects need big commitments of capital as you start those programmes, and given the interest rate increases in the last two or three years in Europe and the US, we've not seen such large programmes starting. My sense is companies are being careful. Right now, a lot of the work we see is around cost takeout or efficiency.Those, as you know, happened a while ago. If you look at generative AI, what we are doing today is market leading, and we are quite happy with the outcome there. Regarding GCCs, there are multiple themes. First, we are partners with them as they are growing in India, because many of their parent organisations have been clients of ours for years. Second, we've seen that these GCC investments have a lifecycle. Things that were created 10-15 years ago, with changes within the companies, they want to move to some different areas, and then they move away from it. So, in the last 2-3 years, we have taken over some GCCs which are older. At the start, we help and support, and as they mature, because of our scale, we are much more able to bring efficiency to those programmes. The automation we build is very different from what some of the GCCs employ. So, as they grow in the maturity lifecycle, we see clients saying, can you take that over and make it more efficient, or become partners with us.When a new technology comes, there's a lot of interest with the client to build something which is more within their own organisation. What is the benefit with us? We are doing hundreds of projects in GenAI, across every industry. Our experience, the people that we work with, the knowledge that we build will be much broader based. So, it's very difficult for someone else to have that level of expertise and depth. Because it's new, it's something that many large companies want to make sure that they have some ability to drive themselves. But as you build scale, that knowledge and depth is where we are very good. And we've seen over time that this plays out. As for efficiency, newer GCCs are probably one hundredth, if not one-thousandth of our size. It is difficult with that scale to make the sort of efficiency play we have, or even the automation tools that we use.In GenAI, we are seeing a real expansion of work. We have 270,000 people trained on GenAI, what we call GenAI aware, practitioners and experts. We are working with something like 16 different large language models. There are three big areas where we see impact. One is software development, the second is customer service, especially in operations and tech. And the third is knowledge objects – we're working with a bank in the credit area, with a pharma company in their drug discovery area, and with a telco in their product specification area – so anywhere there's knowledge objects where you can create some value from faster or more insightful ways of looking at that knowledge. We've been using these things ourselves to improve what's going on within Finacle (Infosys’s banking product). And there are several tools we built. One example is, we've taken an open-source large language model, then built a tool for ourselves on it where we can do more efficient work with Java development on a desktop. So, it completely changes the game on what we can do. We rethought all our service lines with generative AI.In software, we are seeing in the range of 15% benefits in what we are developing with our clients. In customer service, we are seeing great benefits in HR functions.Nandan is a tech visionary and he's obviously very active with us. We are fortunate in that. We want to be more aligned with where clients are going, and that was the change we made. AI-first is understanding that clients want to make changes faster internally. Internally, we have an app, InfyMe, which all of us use for internal things. We have an AI assistant that helps us, whether it's with sales, delivery, HR, or training. We feel quite good about this. We want to make sure we're doing what clients are looking for. A few years ago, there was a much stronger move to digital and cloud. That is still very much part of it. Today, there's much more of an interest in GenAI, and that's how we're changing our company. Our view is that technology will change in five years and Quantum might be the big thing. We will be more aligned to that because that's what our clients are looking for.The revenues are already beyond the PoCs. They're not just trial pilots. They're not large projects, but they're real projects with real impact. We have already been tracking what is generative AI, revenue and so on. At some stage over the next few quarters, we will start to call it out externally. I think a lot of things can be broadly put into AI. So, we are careful to make sure we are measuring GenAI the same way we did with digital. Every project is marked internally, so that we know it's an auditable process.Clients view GenAI as transformative. There are more revenue growth opportunities because you can go faster into some markets. You can do cost efficiency because you can do things better. So, there are three big advantages – revenue, cost and time. When we started digital, the cloud was one piece of it. But today it is the biggest piece in digital.The cleaner the data that is training it, the lesser the hallucination. But in normal life, we hallucinate – forget GenAI, we as people, when we are interacting, we may make some mistakes. So, there is nothing unusual about that. The idea is to reduce and not let that error contaminate other things. Today, there is no usage which is coming to what is called critical system usage, because people are waiting to see how the hallucination can be reduced further. But if you're doing it in different areas -- error mapping and making people more productive -- then you're already in a better place.We don't see them when we compete in the tech world. I think our strength, as you said, is we are very tech oriented. So, if you're a CIO looking to make a choice on who to give your technology work to, I think there are very few options outside of Infosys. Very few CIOs are going to pick someone who is not as strong as Infosys in the tech area. For large companies looking to get technology delivery done with the lowest risk, I think Infosys is the best choice going forward.In cybersecurity, we believe we are well covered, but we must highlight all the risks cybersecurity inherently has. We have security operations centres in multiple locations around the world where we support clients. Cyber is a growing area where we see clients have more needs. But there are also continuous threat actors which we must be watchful about.We gave an update a few days ago with the disclosure in the market. There is no new update from that time.","Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, talks to TOI about the Indian tech industry's focus on AI and GCC.

'U in UPS stands for Modi govt's U-turns': Congress' dig at Centre's Unified Pension Scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/u-in-ups-stands-for-modi-govts-u-turns-congress-dig-at-centres-unified-pension-scheme/articleshow/112777558.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party criticised the government's announcement of the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) on Sunday, alleging that it signifies another “U-turn” by the Modi administration.The opposition party's criticism came a day after the Union Cabinet approved an assured pension of 50 percent of salary for individuals who joined the service under the National Pension System (NPS) after January 1, 2004.The new scheme, introduced ahead of upcoming assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, assures an assured pension of 50 per cent of the last drawn salary.Addressing the issue, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “The 'U' in UPS stands for Modi govt's U-turns! Post June 4, the power of the people has prevailed over the arrogance of power of the Prime Minister.""Kharge also pointed out previous policy reversals, mentioning, “Rollback in the budget regarding Long Term Capital Gain/Indexation. Sending Waqf Bill to JPC. Rollback of Broadcast Bill. Rollback of Lateral Entry.”“We will keep ensuring accountability and protect 140 crore Indians from this despotic government!” Kharge asserted in his post on X.The new pension scheme guarantees a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month on superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service. It stands to benefit 23 lakh centralgovernment employees initially, with potential expansion to 90 lakh if state governments choose to join.Highlighting additional features, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared that the scheme provides assured family pensions to spouses of deceased employees. Moreover, inflation indexation will apply to the assured pension, assured family pension, and the assured minimum pension.With these additions, the Unified Pension Scheme transforms the National Pension System, which earlier promised pensions based on contributions from both employees and the government.This change comes amidst several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and similar demands from employee organisations in other regions.NPS was implemented for all government employees, except for those in the armed forces, who began serving the central government on or after January 1, 2004.Under the Old Pension Scheme, retired government employees received 50 percent of their last drawn salary as monthly pensions, which increased with DA rate hikes. The OPS, however, has been criticised as fiscally unsustainable due to its non-contributory nature, which poses a growing burden on the exchequer.","The opposition party's criticism came a day after the Union Cabinet approved an assured pension of 50 percent of salary for individuals who joined the service under the National Pension System (NPS) after January 1, 2004.

In January 2022, Virat Kohli surprised his fans by stepping down as India's Test captain , and the team's former batting coach Sanjay Bangar believes that he should have continued to lead India in red-ball cricket at that time.Speaking on 'The Rao Podcast', Bangar said: ""I personally feel that he (Kohli) should have continued slightly for longer as a Test captain.He probably captained India in 65 Test matches, and one of things I feel is that he could have probably continued as a Test captain for a longer period.""Kohli achieved unparalleled success as the captain of the Indian Test team. He took charge from MS Dhoni and led the team in 68 matches, securing an impressive 40 victories with a win percentage of 58.82.Kohli's first series win as captain came against Sri Lanka in 2015, marking India's first victory in the island nation in 22 years.Kohli's leadership has been instrumental in Team India's historic achievements, including their maiden Test series triumph in Australia in 2018, victories in the West Indies, claiming the top spot in the Test rankings, and reaching the inaugural ICC World Test Championship Final in 2021.Kohli boasts an exceptional home record as captain, having won 24 out of the 31 Tests played in India, with only two losses.After Kohli's decision to retire, Rohit was named India's skipper in all formats.Both Kohli and Rohit decided to quit T20Is after the T20 World Cup triumph earlier this year.

Unified Pension Scheme: BJP's poll promise reminder after Congress' 'U-turn' swipe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unified-pension-scheme-bjps-poll-promise-reminder-after-congress-u-turn-swipe/articleshow/112784909.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a scathing retort to Congress party's ""U-turn"" jibe on the government's announcement of the Unified Pension Scheme , Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday questioned the grand old party about its plans to meet its election promise of reinstating the Old Pension Scheme in Himachal Pradesh.Senior party leader and MP Ravi Shankar Prasad accused the Congress of making announcements to garner votes and said, ""I want to ask Rahul Gandhi, has his government implemented the Old Pension Scheme as promised in Himachal Pradesh?""""The Congress party has become so wary of the palpable falsehood of its assurance about pension, it could not muster the courage to include that as a part of its manifesto in the Lok Sabha elections,"" the former minister said.""Governing India is a serious business ... The Congress party just makes announcements to garner votes and now the public has lost trust in its decisions,"" he added.This comes after Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the announcement of the Unified Pension Scheme signifies another “U-turn” by the Modi administration.Kharge said, “The 'U' in UPS stands for Modi govt's U-turns! Post June 4, the power of the people has prevailed over the arrogance of power of the Prime Minister.""Kharge also pointed out previous policy reversals, mentioning, “Rollback in the budget regarding Long Term Capital Gain/Indexation. Sending Waqf Bill to JPC. Rollback of Broadcast Bill. Rollback of Lateral Entry.” “We will keep ensuring accountability and protect 140 crore Indians from this despotic government!”The new pension scheme guarantees a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon retirement after at least 10 years of service. Initially, it will benefit 23 lakh central government employees , with the potential to extend to 90 lakh if state governments opt to join.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the scheme also provides assured family pensions for the spouses of deceased employees. Additionally, the pension, family pension, and minimum pension will be adjusted for inflation.This new Unified Pension Scheme replaces the National Pension System (NPS), which previously offered pensions based on contributions from both employees and the government. The change comes as several non-BJP states have reverted to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS), and similar demands are being made by employee organizations in other areas.The NPS, implemented for all central government employees, except those in the armed forces, who started service on or after January 1, 2004, was designed differently from the OPS. Under the Old Pension Scheme, retirees received 50 percent of their last drawn salary as a monthly pension, which increased with cost-of-living adjustments. However, the OPS has faced criticism for being fiscally unsustainable due to its non-contributory nature, which places a growing financial burden on the government.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the announcement of the Unified Pension Scheme signifies another “U-turn” by the Modi administration.

'Shows the poor thinking of Rahul Gandhi'

NEW DELHI: Union minister Giriraj Singh on Sunday said that a caste census is unavoidable and will be carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the right time. The Union Minister questioned why Rahul Gandhi continued to demand a national caste census when the Congress government in Karnataka is yet to release the results of the caste census conducted in the state.""Rahul Gandhi stays away from ground reality and does politics of perception. Caste census has been done in Karnataka, yet the Congress government there has not declared it. When it's time for the country, PM Modi will get it done,"" Giriraj Singh said.During an event in Prayagraj on Saturday, Rahul Gandhi had claimed that around 90% of the population remains disconnected from the system, despite possessing the necessary skills and talents, which is the reason behind the demand for a caste census.“90% of the people are not a part of the system. They have the required skill, talent but they are not connected with the system. That's why we are demanding a caste census. BJP leaders are saying that an OBC section will be given after the caste census,” Rahul had said.Singh continued his attack on Rahul Gandhi, claiming that he was out of touch with his own identity and incapable of fulfilling promises made to the backward communities. ""Rahul Gandhi, who cannot tell his religion or caste, cannot declare the caste census done in Karnataka. Only Modi will ensure benefits to the backward and extremely backward communities, not Rahul Gandhi's perception of politics,"" the Union minister said.Union minister Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) Singh accused Rahul Gandhi of shedding ""crocodile tears"" over the caste census issue. Lalan Singh alleged that Gandhi's concern was not genuine, and said that when Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar carried out a caste census, Rahul did not support it.""Rahul Gandhi is very concerned about the caste census. When Nitish Kumar conducted the census in Bihar and at that time we were in INDIA, then 2 meetings were held, we said that a resolution should be passed on the caste census. But he did not pass the resolution under pressure from Mamata Banerjee. Today he is shedding crocodile tears. When we got the census done, has Rahul Gandhi ever praised it in Bihar to date? He is just giving a slogan to confuse the public,"" he said.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya slammed Rahul Gandhi's remarks about the Miss India list, which Gandhi claimed did not include any Dalit, Adivasi (tribal), or OBC women. Malviya said that these comments reflect the childish mentality of the Leader of the Opposition. According to Malviya, Gandhi's remarks suggest a form of discriminatory attitude that implies women from SC/ST/OBC backgrounds are unable to succeed in beauty pageants like Miss India.""It is understandable that a 54 year old middle aged person is going through the list of Miss India. But it is not understandable that he is looking for caste in it. This childish mentality shows the poor thinking of Rahul Gandhi. A kind of perverse sexism according to which girls of SC/ST/OBC community cannot move forward in competitions like Miss India,"" Malviya said in a post on X.""Those Congress workers who were sitting in front and whistling and enjoying themselves like ruffians were more foolish than Rahul Gandhi who failed for the third time,"" the post added.Rahul while speaking at the 'Samvidhan Samman Sammelan' in Prayagraj had said, ""I have checked the list of Miss India, which did not have any Dalit, Adivasi (tribal) or OBC women. Some will talk about cricket or Bollywood. No one will show the cobbler or plumber. Even top anchors in the media are not from the 90%.""","Giriraj Singh said that a caste census is unavoidable and will be carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the right time.

""Unless we demolish the entire network or chain, we cannot control the illegal trade of narcotics. It's an international problem. In India, we need to create more awareness and fight against it. I would say some nations have lost the battle against the illegal trade of narcotics.

Those who consume drugs are victims of the system, while those who trade in drugs are criminals, Shah said, adding narcotics not only destroys youths' lives but also poses a threat to national security.He then cited Modi's resolve to make the nation free from addiction by 2047 when India will celebrate ""Azadi Ka Shatabdi Samaroh"", adding a coordinated effort was required to achieve this goal.Shah said the trend of drug trafficking is changing from natural to synthetic drugs that are available in small quantities but are ""expensive and more harmful than natural drugs"".In Chhattisgarh, sedative use has been reported more than the national average at 1.45%, he said, pointing out that since Chhattisgarh shares a boundary with seven states, it makes the challenge tougher.

Future of Bangladesh's textile industry amidst political uncertainty

Bangladesh's textile industry, a significant contributor to GDP and employment, faces uncertainty following Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Her tenure saw infrastructure improvements, special economic zones, and labour reforms that boosted exports. Political instability now threatens foreign investment, trade relations, and labour peace, raising concerns about the industry's future resilience and growth.

NEW DELHI: Expressing satisfaction over the response to his recent exhortation from Red Fort to connect over one lakh youth without a political pedigree with politics, PM Narendra Modi , in his monthly radio talk ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday said a large number of youth, keen to join politics, were looking for the right opportunity and guidance.“I have also received letters from youth across the country on this subject.Enormous response is being received on social media as well. People have sent me many kinds of suggestions. Some youth have written in their letters that it is truly inconceivable for them. On account of the absence of a political legacy on the part of their grandfather or parents they could not enter politics despite wanting to join,” the PM said.Citing a few responses to his Red Fort call, Modi said some youth had written that they possessed good experience working at the ground level and, hence, they could help solve people’s problems.“Some youth have also written that dynastic politics crushes new talent. Some youth have mentioned that such efforts will lend more strength to our democracy. I thank everyone for sending in suggestions on the subject. I hope that now with our collective efforts, youth who do not possess a political background will also be able to come forward in politics... their experience and their fervour will prove useful for the country,” Modi said.He recalled the freedom movement and said many people without a political background had come forward and took the plunge for the sake of India’s freedom. “Once more, we require the same spirit to attain the goal of Viksit Bharat. I shall urge all my young friends to positively join this campaign. This step of yours will be transformative in terms of your future and the country’s future,” the PM said.He also hailed people for the success of ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign and said when people join hands to express a sentiment, it lends unparalleled glory to any campaign.","PM Modi discussed India's progress toward a 'Viksit Bharat' and highlighted the positive response to his call for young people to join politics.

Maharashtra becomes 1st state to offer Unified Pension Scheme to employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-becomes-1st-state-to-offer-ups-to-employees/articleshow/112788305.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours after central government employees ' organisations demanded that state governments implement the Unified Pension Scheme ( UPS ), poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday became the first state to offer a switch to its employees amid expectation that others, especially those governed by NDA, will follow suit.The decision came 24 hours after Union cabinet approved UPS to offer 50% of an employee's average salary for the last 12 months as pension, along with inflation adjustment and other sweeteners to address the demands of govt employees who joined in 2004 and later.While 23 lakh central govt employees stand to benefit from Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), the number may rise to 90 lakh if all states offer it. Urging states to implement the scheme, top representatives of central govt employees said political parties should not politicise the issue. Though they said OPS is the best option as it did not require employees to make any contribution, they are satisfied with UPS.“We should be practical to see what best we can get and govt can provide. UPS incorporates 90% of the provisions of OPS and so we are happy. Govt is working on a lump sum amount that employees covered by UPS will get at the time of their retirement from their monthly contribution,” said Shiv Gopal Mishra of All India Railwaymen’s Federation and secretary (staff side) of national council of JCM.Mishra said in the current scenario, nothing could be a better solution than UPS. He said since state govt employees and their associations are also part of the agitation to get a fair deal for all those recruited from Jan 2004 onwards, they will also pursue state governments to implement this quickly.Cabinet secretary-designate T V Somanathan, who headed the panel to review NPS & held negotiations with staff organisations, said on Saturday that Centre’s UPS template can be replicated by states. He had said that over 99% of the employees covered under NPS would find it beneficial to shift to UPS.JCM chief M Raghavaiah said staff body expected more states to implement UPS and urged Centre and the states to guarantee pension of 50% of the salary for those who have served 20 years in place of 25 years. He said the lump sum amount to be paid at the time of retirement should be one-fourth of monthly pay of past six months.Sources said UPS will benefit over eight lakh railways employees who have joined service in past 20 years. “Welfare of govt employees should be an issue of ‘they vs us’ for political parties as we work for organisations irrespective of which party is in power,” said a senior representative when asked about Congress taking potshots at BJP.","Poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday became the first state to offer a switch to its employees amid expectation that others, especially those governed by NDA, will follow suit.

Not only must the culprit be sternly punished for committing such crimes, but all those who try to protect them must be dealt with an iron hand,"" he said at a ' Lakhpati Didi ' convention in north Maharashtra's Jalgaon.Although he didn't refer to any specific case, his remarks hold weight following the recent rape-murder of a PG resident doctor in Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and the rape of two minor girls in Badlapur. Both sparked nationwide outrage.PM Modi expressed his empathy for the anger and pain felt by women across the country. He warned that police, doctors, and school representatives protecting culprits should not be spared.A message must go from top to bottom that such acts ( crime against women ) will not be tolerated, PM Modi said. He also underlined the responsibility of state govts, political parties and society to prevent crimes against women.“Govts will come and go but crime against women must be tackled with an iron hand at all costs,” he said. He assured that Centre is ready to support state govts in addressing such crimes.PM PM Modi highlighted new provisions in Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) that ensure tough penalties for crime against women, including hanging and life imprisonment. “In my mission of Viksit Bharat, the country’s women are playing an important role and hence, there is a need to further empower them. But there is also a simultaneous need to ensure theirsafety and security ,” the PM said.The event organised by Maharashtra govt honoured women under Union govt’s Lakhpati Didi scheme, which recognises self-help group (SHG) members who earn an annual household income of Rs 1 lakh or more. PM Modi handed certificates to 11 lakh new Lakhpati Didis and released a revolving fund of Rs 2,500 crore for 48 lakh SHG members. Bank loans worth Rs 5,000 crore were disbursed to benefit over 25 lakh SHG members.PM Modi said Lakhpati Didi scheme is designed to make women financially stable. “Compare the work done by opposition in 60 years and initiatives that our govt had taken in one decade. Till 2014, Centre had given bank loans to Sakhi Mandals amounting to Rs 25,000 crore. In contrast, our govt gave bank loans of Rs 9 lakh crore,” he said.“The state is playing an important role in our Viksit Bharat initiative. Mahayuti govt should remain in office for a long time. It is stable and capable of attracting investments to promote industrialisation, employment generation, and give adequate focus on education and skill development of youth,” he said.","PM Modi expressed his empathy for the anger and pain felt by women across the country.

However, the work done till July in 2024-25 is 23 crore person-days fewer than in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, marking an improvement this year, according to statistics provided by the Union rural development ministry .Fiscal 2019-20 is considered a normal year under MGNREGS as the employment pattern followed the predictable variables of work demand , before it was upended by the pandemic which resulted in a national lockdown and halting of the economy. It witnessed a record rise in job demand under the distress employment programme.The work done in 2020-21 shot through the roof with a record over 389 crore person-days. It came down marginally in 2021-22 at just over 363 crore, and further to around 294 crore in 2022-23. The improvement, with a dip in MGNREGS work performance, was expected as the economy opened up with rollback of the lockdown, resulting in return of workers to traditional centres of employment.The person-days generated between April-July in 2024-25 stands at 127.9 crore, as against 150.2 crore in the same month in 2023-24. In contrast, 114.8 crore person-days were recorded in 2019-20.Crucially, the 150 crore person-days mark in April-July last year was unexpectedly high as the lockdown had been rolled back over two years ago. The person-days in 2023-24 ended the downward graph, and rose to 308 crore.The budget allocation in 2024-25 is over Rs 19,000 crore less than the expenditure incurred in the scheme in 2023-24, but may be enough to feed the work demand if the present trend holds. However, civil society experts working the ground say the introduction of national mobile monitoring software for marking attendance has hurt workers and played a role in bringing down demand, as has Aadhaar-based payment system.","The work done till July in 2024-25 is 23 crore person-days fewer than in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

"With government share at 18.5%, UPS switch to give higher pension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-government-share-at-18-5-ups-switch-to-give-higher-pension/articleshow/112787454.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government employees switching to the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) can hope to see a significant increase in their pension, as govt's contribution is set to increase from 14% to 18.5%.A calculation done by UTI Pension fund for TOI shows that the increase will be around 19% for those who join on a monthly salary of Rs 50,000 and see an annual increase of 3% with their corpus seeing a compounded annual growth of 8% - lower than what all the three fund managers have offered (see graphic).The corpus will probably be bigger given that the calculations have not factored in dearness allowance during the period of service as also the pay commission awards. Similarly, the monthly pension payment does not factor in the impact of dearness relief, the adjustment for inflation, that govt promised to all employees who joined service from 2004 and are part of NPS.Currently, there are three pension fund managers for govt employees - SBI, LIC and UTI - offering three schemes. Since inception in April 2008, the highest return of 9.75% is offered to central govt employees by SBI pension fund, while for the state govts, LIC Pension Fund offered the highest return of 9.56% since June 2009, according to data on the NPS Trust website.Similarly, UTI Pension Fund has assumed 6% annual return on annuities, against 5.6% to over 7% currently offered by insurance companies.Under existing rules, govt employees have three investment options with the default option, used by 95% of the subscribers, allowing up to 65% investment in govt securities, 15% in equities and the remaining in corporate debt. There is also the option to invest the entire money in g-secs and a third one - Moderate Life Cycle Fund - which allows those up to 35 years to invest 50% of the corpus in equities, 30% in corporate bonds and the remaining 20% in g-secs. The allocation towards equities falls 2% annually once the subscriber turns 35 and by the time she is 55 years, 80% is invested in g-secs with the remaining 20% allowed to be split equally between equities and corporate bonds.Fund managers said that to earn 50% of the average salary for 12 months the corpus needs to be large and with the 14% contribution by govt the objective would not have been met, prompting an increase to 18.5%. Also, employee contribution has been retained at 10%. Going forward, govt may have to increase its share of the contribution in case market returns fall.""UPS is good for retiring employees. But they will miss the opportunity to potentially earn even higher returns,"" said D Swarup, former chairman of Pension Fund Regulator and Development Authority.

In keeping with the trend seen since the Lok Sabha elections, after AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s name, his wife Sunita is firmly pitched at No.2 on the list of campaigners submitted for approval to the Election Commission on Saturday.One finds Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann’s name next on the list followed by former deputy CM Manish Sisodia who came out on bail earlier this month in the Delhi excise policy scam case and has since been out among people holding 'padyatras'. According to the party he will be stepping out of the Delhi more and more now for campaigning now.The list of seven seats in J&K for which candidates were announced by party general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak include Pulwama, Rajpora, Devsar, Dooru, Doda, Doda West and Banihal.The list of 40 star campaigners announced later in the evening on Sunday also includes senior AAP leaders Pankaj Gupta, Rajya Sabha MPs Sanjay Singh, Sandeep Pathak, Raghav Chadha, ND Gupta and Delhi ministers Gopal Rai, Atishi, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Imran Hussain, Kailash Gehlot and former health minister Satyendar Jain.On Sunita Kejriwal continuing to stay at the top of the list of star campaigners even after Lok sabha polls as is being seen in Haryana and now in the J&K list, AAP sources say that this is strategically aimed at conveying to the people that Arvind Kejriwal is very much listening to their concerns through his wife who shares what the public feels with him when she visits him in Tihar jail. Kejriwal was arrested and is in jail in connection with a money laundering case related to the now scrapped Delhi liquor policy. The Supreme Court will be hearing his bail pleas on Sep 6.“The party feels that public feedback reflects that people see Arvind Kejriwal as the face of AAP and his wife as a star campaigner helps establish that connect which people are looking for with the Delhi CM and AAP national convenor,” sources said.Party leaders also feel that Sunita Kejriwal’s prominence on the star campaigner list is in no way a reflection on the status of other top leaders like Sisodia who, party sources say, is firmly stepping up the outreach among people since he came out on bail. On Sunday, Sisodia visited Punjab for the first time since his release from jail. He was seen offering prayers at Golden Temple with his family and visiting Wagah border along with Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann.","Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday also shared its list of 40 star campaigners for the state. In keeping with the trend seen since the Lok Sabha elections, after AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s name, his wife Sunita is firmly pitched at No.2 on the list of campaigners.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112786699,imgsize-775474,width-400,resizemode-4/112786699.jpg"
