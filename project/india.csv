Govt considering holding 2-tier NEET-UG with dual organisers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-considering-holding-2-tier-neet-ug-with-dual-organisers/articleshow/111871455.cms,"NEW DELHI: Significant changes are anticipated for the undergraduate medical/dental entrance test, as the govt is considering dividing the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) into a two-tier exam system, with dual organisers . Another major amendment likely is transitioning to a hybrid mode of delivery.According to govt sources, there are a number of options that are presently being weighed, even as the fate of the NEET-UG 2024 is to be decided by the Supreme Court which is hearing a bunch of petitions including pleas for cancellation and retest of the exam conducted on May 5, 2024, due to an alleged paper leak.Some of the changes under discussion involve overhauling NEET-UG to a two-tiered exam - preliminary and finals. According to sources in the knowledge of the developments, the number of candidates to be selected for the finals is likely to be four to five times the number of seats, and the eligibility cutoff will be determined based on the preliminary scores and the total number of seats.""There are also deliberations on whether the finals can be delivered on CBT mode, while continuing with pen-paper mode for the prelims. Another aspect being looked into is to engage separate agencies for prelims and finals . For example, if the preliminary test is conducted by the NTA, can the finals be entrusted to the National Board of Examinations (NBE)/ Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)/ All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)?"" said the senior govt official.This, according to the source, is to introduce multiple layers of security. ""In case there are doubts that some candidates did manage to sneak in via wrong means in the prelims as the numbers are getting bigger every year, it will be difficult to make the cut in the finals.""NEET was introduced in 2016 after a five-year legal battle when a constitution bench of the Supreme Court on April 11, 2016, struck down its 2013 judgment, thereby reviving the Centre's December 21, 2010, notification for holding a single common entrance test for MBBS/BDS courses in India. Since the first NEET conducted by CBSE on May 1, 2016, where 6 lakh aspirants attended, this year over 24 lakh registered and over 23 lakh appeared, making it one of the most competitive exams in the country, with a ratio of nearly 21 candidates per seat, and approximately 42 aspirants per govt seat.As in the latest edition, NEET-UG has courted controversies including accusations of paper leaks and other irregularities, including in the first edition in 2016 when there were pleas filed in the SC over the alleged compromise of the question paper in Uttarakhand.","The Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions including pleas for cancellation and retest of the exam conducted on May 5, 2024, due to an alleged paper leak.

Monetisation of assets will take place to pay off the liabilities. In the interim of monetisation of assets and some bonds getting due, the sovereign guarantee bonds stand good. Government of India stands behind those bonds and there will be no default.”Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress curtain-raiser event here, Scindia said despite delays, people should have “national pride” and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies and not something which is sourced from foreign vendors.“Develop a sense of national pride… The easy for us would have been to pick up technologies (from global vendors), and do what others do. But we feel that India must not be just a supplier of services, but also of products. So, we chose the harder way, and decided to develop the India 4G stack ourselves.”A consortium of Tata-run Tejas and TCS and public sector C-DOT has been working on the complex technologies to develop 4G and 5G telecom infrastructure that will be deployed on BSNL and MTNL networks. “Let me guarantee. We are on track to deploy one lakh RANs (radio access networks) towards this effort.”Scindia said efforts of the govt have been to develop technologies within India which will be used not only for domestic use, but also for exports. “From hardly anything a decade back, export of telecom equipment last year was to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.”The minister also said that the govt wants to be a facilitator in enabling the growth of the sector, against acting as a regulator. He said after leapfrogging and witnessing rapid growth in 5G, India is now working to be a leader in the development of 6G technologies. “A country that followed the world in 4G, walked with it in 5G, will now lead when it comes to 6G.”Scindia said that India is now working on encouraging the development of apps and solutions for 5G that would be deployed in rural areas.On cybersecurity, the minister said that as India develops on the digital front, there is a looming threat on the front of cyber security. “Wars today are not only fought on land, but also on the cloud. It is important to protect the country, the citizens, and businesses when it comes to cybersecurity.”","Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said turnaround efforts of state- run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis.

The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

That is what still gives hope to the free world,"" Ramaswamy stated.He added, ""And if we can revive that dream over group identity, victimhood, and grievance, then nobody in the world, not a nation, not a corporation, not a virus, not China, is going to defeat us. That is what American exceptionalism is all about. And that is what we will revive this November when we send Donald J Trump back to the White House.""Earlier in the day, the 38-year-old addressed the issue of illegal immigration, promising firm action.

Induction of more troops from the CAPFs (central armed police forces) is also taking place,” a source said.The Army is conducting “a series of joint and coordinated operations” with the J&K Police to eliminate “foreign (Pakistan-origin) terrorists” who have sneaked into the Jammu region, which has easier infiltration routes from across the border as compared to the Kashmir Valley.“The well-trained terrorists, armed with modern weapons like MP-4 assault rifles, steel-core bullets and highly-encrypted communication equipment, come to the bowls in the region for sustenance and attacks and then retreat to the upper reaches in the thickly-forested hilly terrain,” the source said.As reported by TOI, the lack of requisite “human intelligence” and “signal intelligence” is hampering the counter-terror operations in the Jammu region, with consequent setbacks to the security forces. “The Intelligence Bureau, J&K Police and other agencies involved need to get their act together,” another source said.The density of Army troops in the region had thinned down over the years due to relative calm as opposed to the Kashmir Valley. The number of soldiers further reduced after the “Uniform Force” (with around 15,000 troops) of the Army’s specialized counterinsurgency Rashtriya Rifles (RR) was shifted to eastern Ladakh after the Chinese incursions there in May 2020.The Army, of course, still has the RR’s Romeo Force (Rajouri, Poonch Reasi) and Delta Force (Doda, Udhampur and Kishtwar), each of which has around 15,000 troops, as well as regular infantry battalions deployed in the Jammu region. “A few battalions were sent to the Jammu region earlier, and now another 3,000 soldiers have also been moved there,” the source said.","General Upendra Dwivedi is also slated to visit the area to review the operational situation on Saturday. “A brigade headquarters, three infantry battalions and some teams of the elite Para-Special Forces’ have been rushed to the Jammu region from outside J&K.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111870603,imgsize-37934,width-400,resizemode-4/111870603.jpg"

""I will absolutely … never support or encourage"" any divide in the name of caste or religion,"" Union minister and LJP chief Chirag Paswan said opposing the Muzaffarnagar police advisory.Paswan said he believes two classes of people – rich and poor – exist in the society and persons of different castes and religions fall in both categories. ""We need to bridge the gap between these two classes of people. It is every government's responsibility to work for the poor, which includes all sections of society such as Dalits, backwards, upper castes and Muslims as well. All are there. We need to work for them,"" the LJP chief added.And its not just allies in Bihar who are opposing the Kanwar advisory, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is a key partner of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, has also objected to the police order.""Gandhiji, Chaudhary Charan Singh and other personalities have spoken about keeping religion and caste behind. Now, politicians are taking forward religion and caste forward in politics. I think the action is not correct. Why do you make someone write their name on street carts? They have the right to work ... This tradition is absolutely wrong,"" RLD national general secretary Trilok Tyagi said.""It is up to the customer, they can make purchases from wherever they want ... I would like to ask politicians - does consuming alcohol not corrupt you religiously? Does it happen only when you consume meat? So, why is there no prohibition on alcohol? Why do they not speak about alcohol? Because those who do business have a nexus, it is a game of the powerful. These small shops are set up by the poor. So, you are pointing fingers at them. I would demand that ban alcohol too,"" he added.Meanwhile, unfazed by the controversy triggered by the Muzaffarnagar police directive, cops of Haridwar in neighbouring Uttarakhand have issued similar order for eateries on Kanwar route in the district. Haridwar Police has warned of legal action against those who do not comply with the order.""Regarding the preparations for Kanwar, we have given general instructions to the hotels, dhabas, restaurants and hawkers on the Kanwar route that they will write the name of the owner on their shops and if they fail to do so, we will take legal action against them. Many times, a situation of dispute arises due to this, hence this decision has been taken by us,"" Haridwar SSP Padmendra Dobal said.The BJP had yesterday come down heavily on the opposition parties for objecting to the directive of Muzaffarnagar police. The BJP leaders cited the display of Halal certification for Muslims to justify the move and questioned why a decision that has been taken to protect the religious beliefs of Kanwar devotees was being opposed.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla had slammed those objecting to the police order and said: ""Display of Halal certification to ensure Muslims' religious feelings are not hurt = Peak Secularism. Request to ALL eateries to comply with law & make proper disclosures of name to ensure that Kanwariyas' Astha is not hurt by false information- Peak Bigotry.""BJP leader Amit Malviya had also hit out at the opposition. ""If food is a choice, and restaurants, including some MNCs, delivery apps, catering to Muslim sensibilities, prominently display Halal compliance certificates, then why should it be any different for fasting Hindus (Kanwar Yatris in this case), who may want to eat at a pure veg restaurant, where the likelihood of them being served Satvik food is higher? Is giving Hindus equal right to choice a sin?"" he had said in a post on X.The opposition parties have reacted strongly to the move calling it discriminatory.(With inputs from agencies)","UP police order directing eateries on Kanwar Yatra route to display names of owners and workers has divided the ruling National Democratic Alliance.

CHENNAI: Centre should have consulted at least the law commission before rolling out three new sets of criminal laws to replace IPC, CrPC, and the Evidence Act from July 1, Madras HC said Friday while admitting DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi's writ petition seeking to declare them ""unconstitutional"".""The law commission exists only for such a purpose (to advise govt on legal matters),"" the division bench of Justice S S Sundar and Justice N Senthilkumar said.The bench wondered why Centre wanted to replace the original three laws when the changes it wanted could have been incorporated through amendments to the existing Acts. The new laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam - might cause confusion and require special interpretation, delaying justice delivery, it said. ""The intention of the amendments might be good. But we are concerned with the delay it might cause,"" the bench said.Senior advocate N R Elango, representing Bharathi, contended that Parliament introduced and passed the new laws without any meaningful discussion. ""The laws go against the legitimate expectation of the citizens that laws touching upon their everyday life as victims or accused would be passed with an open mind and after an elaborate discussion,"" he said.""The new laws do not bring in any substantial changes but merely shuffle the existing sections, which were unnecessary and would cause great inconvenience and confusion to the people regarding its interpretation. Shuffling the sections would make it very difficult for the judges, advocates, law enforcement agencies, and the public to correlate the new provisions with the old provisions to search for precedents,"" Elango said.After Centre's counsel sought time to respond to the pleas, the bench adjourned the hearing by four weeks.

It further clarified that the Jan verdict had considered the earlier rulings.SC on Jan 8 had quashed Gujarat govt's decision to grant remission to 11 convicts who gang-raped Bilkis Bano and killed 14 of her family members in the 2002 communal riots and directed them to surrender before the jail authority, one-and-a-half years after they were granted liberty by the state.Allowing Bilkis Bano's plea challenging their remission, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan had found fault not only with Gujarat govt's decision but also with the order passed by SC in 2022 which triggered the process by directing the state to decide the remission plea of one of the convicts. SC said the state acted on the basis of the direction issued by SC but contrary to the letter and spirit of the law.","Radheyshyam Bhagwandas and Rajubhai Babulal, undergoing life imprisonment, challenged SC's Jan verdict cancelling their remission.

BENGALURU: The world witnessed an unprecedented IT outage over Thursday and Friday that affected almost every business from airlines to healthcare, financial markets and govt agencies running Microsoft computers.Flights were delayed or cancelled. Banks were unable to issue money. Some retailers had to shut outlets, some put up signs saying they could only accept cash as the biggest IT outage ever affected people around the world.Operations across broadcasters, banks, airports, and transportation suffered massive disruption.Hundreds of flights were cancelled and airports from Australia to US and UK, and India witnessed chaotic scenes.Reports suggest that operations were yet to normalise at several places as the world struggled to come to terms with the enormity of the disruption. The outage was not caused by a cyberattack, as was initially feared. It began with a routine software update from US cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. The firm's solutions are widely used by organisations using Microsoft's Windows operating system. CrowdStrike 's software, Falcon Sensor, is designed to protect computer systems from cyberattacks. However, a defect in its latest update for computers running Windows OS triggered the issue.Those logging into their systems saw what's called the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - an error message that's displayed when the operating system encounters a critical issue that it cannot recover from.Within hours, Microsoft and CrowdStrike identified the issue and deployed a fix. But systems already impacted needed to be set right with manual workarounds. Given the scale of computers impacted and limited IT staff in organisations, this was still work in progress in most large businesses on Friday.Paris Olympic Committee said the outage was slowing its operations but tickets sales were not affected. In UK, general physicians and pharmacies were hit hard and faced shutdowns.CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz on X said, ""We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on. He also apologised for the massive disruption saying, ""We are deeply sorry.""Sundareshwar K, partner and leader for cyber security at consultancy firm PwC India, said, ""This is a Black Swan event impacting not just businesses but the overall national machinery, and underscores how safeguarding entities against risk involves much more than technology. This development highlights how it is a misnomer that enhanced technology deployment alone will help organisations become more secure and ensure business continuity.""Back home, the enormity of the outage was felt across industries with airlines issuing handwritten boarding passes.IndiGo flyer Akshay Kothari took to X to share a photograph of his handwritten boarding pass for a Hyderabad-Kolkata flight. ""I got my first handwritten boarding pass today,"" he said. Indian carriers, including Indigo, Akasa Air, Air India Express, and SpiceJet, encountered glitches that impacted services including ticket booking and web check-in.Tata Starbucks, sources said, faced issues with some of its PoS (point of sale) systems, but there was no major impact on the business. Some sellers on Amazon, Meesho and Flipkart faced glitches with their inventory management systems supported by Microsoft, an executive with one of the firms said on condition of anonymity. Amazon and Flipkart did not respond to queries, while a Meesho spokesperson said there had been no impact.PhonePe's stock broking platform Share.market faced issues during the day. The company later said the services had been restored and apologised for the inconvenience.""This is a very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world's core internet infrastructure,"" Ciaran Martin, former head of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre and now a professor at Oxford University, told the New York Times.","The outage was not caused by a cyberattack, as was initially feared.

NEW DELHI: For the first time, Supreme Court will test the constitutional validity of immunity from criminal proceedings accorded to the President and governors.On Friday, it entertained the plea of an woman ex-employee of Kolkata Raj Bhavan who said the constitutional provision (Article 361) had prevented police from probing her charge of sexual harassment against Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose.""How can police and courts be silent on a crime committed by a governor that violated the right to dignity, self-respect and safety of an employee guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution ?"" asked Shyam Divan, counsel for the woman, leading SC to peer into the issue.Divan, counsel for the woman, said instead of inquiring into the serious 'incident', police have remained inactive because of the governor's immunity from criminal proceedings. ""When a serious criminal offence is alleged, police machinery must move with alacrity to gather evidence, which otherwise may be obliterated with passage of time and the constitutional post holder may influence witnesses,"" he said.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notice to West Bengal govt, sought assistance of attorney general R Venkataramani to adjudicate this complex constitutional question and asked Divan to make Centre a party to the petition where the woman said while she was left without remedy, the governor is giving statements ridiculing her and trashing her allegations as politically motivated.It posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.Clauses 2 and 3 of Article 361 of the Constitution provides, ""No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President, or the governor of a state, in any court during his term of office; and, no process for the arrest or imprisonment of the President, or the governor of a state, shall issue from any court during his term of office.""The petitioner, who has a masters in computer applications and was working in Raj Bhavan's EPABX department, through her advocate on record Udayaditya Banerjee said SC must decide whether the immunity conferred on the President and governors could be unfettered and absolute, a privilege that is conferred on none as all are governed by the rule of law.""While a civil suit against the governor can be instituted after two months of a notice in writing is served on the governor, no such timeline is prescribed for criminal proceedings, which again renders the petitioner remediless,"" the petition said.""The incident resulting in the present case arises out of two major instances that took place on April 24 and May 2 this year, when the Bengal governor called upon her on a false pretext of offering her a better job only to sexually harass her, within the premises of Raj Bhavan during working hours,"" the petition alleged.Giving details of the alleged sexual harassment and molestation in the petition, she said while no action was taken by police to investigate her complaint, the governor has been giving statements to media terming her as a political tool.","For the first time, Supreme Court will test the constitutional validity of immunity from criminal proceedings accorded to the President and governors.

UPSC has issued probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar a show-cause notice, asking why her candidature in the 2022 civil services exam should not be cancelled, in which case she would cease to be part of the IAS and be barred from all future competitive exams, report Rajshekhar Jha & Bharti Jain.Delhi crime branch will also investigate how Khedkar got an MBBS seat at Pune's Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College by availing reservation in the ' Nomadic Tribe-3 ' category.Based on UPSC's complaint, police have slapped IPC sections 420 (cheating), 464 (making a document in the name of a fictitious person), 465 (forgery) and 471 (passing off a forged document as genuine) on Puja. She additionally faces charges under sections 89 and 91 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and 66D of the Information Technology Act.Officials said IPC had been invoked as the alleged offences were committed before the new criminal laws took effect on July 1.""UPSC has conducted a detailed and thorough investigation into the misdemeanour of Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar...She fraudulently availed attempts beyond the permissible limit under the examination rules by faking her identity by way of changing her name, her father's and mother's names, her photograph/signature, her email ID, mobile number and address,"" UPSC said.In 2021, Khedkar cleared the mains and was supposed to undergo a medical test at AIIMS, which she allegedly ran away from to avoid being caught faking disability. ""The next year, she again appeared for the exam, using a fake certificate. Even before the results appeared, she applied for UPSC 2023,"" an officer said, quoting from UPSC's complaint.The complaint alleges that Khedkar showed her parents Dilip and Manorama Khedkar as having separated, so that their assets could be segregated and she could apply for a fake income certificate. Manorama was arrested Thursday in a different criminal case.An official said the inquiry being conducted by the department of personnel and training (DoPT) into Khedkar's candidature was on track and the report should be ready in two weeks. The DoPT committee's report is likely to echo the findings of UPSC's investigation into Khedkar's ""misdemeanours"", including the false OBC and disability claims that paved the way for her entry into the civil services.""UPSC stringently adheres to its constitutional mandate, and conducts all its processes, including all examinations, with the highest possible order of due diligence without any compromise. The commission is unequivocally committed to ensure that such high order of trust and credibility remains intact and uncompromised,"" the agency said in its press statement.In her first reaction to the FIR , Khedkar told reporters in Pune the ""judiciary will take its course"".","Puja Khedkar is a probationary IAS officer.

Had I hit on any other part of its body, the tiger would not have given me a second chance,"" she had said.
