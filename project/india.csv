India and US in Advanced Talks for Co-Production of Combat Vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-and-us-in-advanced-talks-for-co-production-of-combat-vehicles/articleshow/111044765.cms,"Rajat.PanditNew Delhi: India and the US are now in an “advanced stage of talks” for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) as part of their defence-industrial cooperation roadmap.With the US also recently offering to demonstrate the mobility and firepower of the eight-wheeled Stryker in high-altitude areas in India, the defence ministry is examining a three-phase plan for the proposed project, sources told TOI. Under the plan, there will be a limited off-the-shelf purchase of the Strykers under the foreign military sales (FMS) programme of the US, which will be followed by joint production in India, and finally there will be co-development of its futuristic versions, sources said.All this, however, is contingent on the Stryker meeting the operational requirements of the Army’s mechanised infantry battalions as well as a high level of indigenisation and transfer of critical technologies to the Indian co-production partner, which could be a defence PSU or a private firm.“If the Stryker project is finalised, the existing Indian capabilities in ICVs will be taken into account. Strykers will have to be customised and technologically configured for Indian terrain, including operations in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Sikkim,” a source said.With the Army having a huge requirement of futuristic wheeled and tracked ICVs to progressively replace its existing fleet of over 2,000 Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles in the years ahead, MoD is also pursuing indigenous projects. “ Army also needs ICVs capable of amphibious operations in large numbers as well. Strykers are not amphibious,” another source said.The US is hard-selling the Strykers. Ahead of US national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s visit to India, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin cited the “co-production of armoured vehicles with India” as yet another indicator of the upward trajectory in the bilateral defence partnership during the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore two weeks ago. The US, incidentally, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth around $22 billion since 2007. While the Stryker project is still in the discussion stage, India and the US are conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for inking two mega deals within this financial year.The first is acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B high-altitude, long endurance drones and associated equipment for $3.9 billion, as reported by TOI earlier. The second is the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of tech for around $1 billion.","India and the US are now in an “advanced stage of talks’ for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles.

Immediately afterwards, security forces cordoned off the area and started searches. Gunshots stopped after some time while the search operation is still going on in the area,” officials was quoted as saying.This comes a day after Amit Shah reviewed the security situation in the Union territory in the wake of recent terrorist attacks.Shah, on Sunday, directed security agencies to implement area domination and zero-terror plans in the Jammu division like they did in Kashmir to achieve success.In another subsequent meeting, the home minister reviewed the preparations for the annual pilgrimage to the cave shrine of Amarnath in the south Kashmir Himalayas.Since June 9, there have been terror strikes at four places in Reasi, Kathua and Doda, where nine pilgrims were killed, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan was killed, a civilian was injured and at least seven security personnel were injured.Last week on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also chaired a high-level meeting to discuss the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir following the series of terror-related incidents.More details regarding the gunshots and ongoing search operation in Bandipora are awaited as the situation continues to unfold.","The incident occurred in the forest area of Aragam village in Bandipora.

"Doctors, students and activists team up to lead fight against NEET irregularities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctors-students-and-activists-team-up-to-lead-fight-against-neet-irregularities/articleshow/111045251.cms,"Three days before the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) on May 5, some students received pop-up alerts on Telegram: ""Leak paper available, price Rs 5000, message to buy @HQPaper.""The Supreme Court has now issued notices to the Centre and NTA on these alleged leaks after PILs piled up. But RTI activist Vivek Pandey says he had posted about these 'leak paper' offers on social media platforms even before the test. ""But it fell on deaf ears,"" he says. On May 5, the day of the exam, Pandey felt a sense of deja vu.But rather than just being happy with his I-told-you-so moment, Pandey has been spending most of his time filing complaints with the Union health ministry on the problems with NEET-UG, seeking updates from Bihar police about investigations into a leak from the state while also petitioning for action against the NTA in the SC. He had earlier filed an RTI seeking clarifications on the grace marks awarded by NTA which later withdrew them.Discrepancies in exams are personal for him. He attempted to pass the pre-medical test (PMT) in Madhya Pradesh for nearly four years but always ended up in failure. It was only when the Vyapam scam-where students cheated on a large scale to pass the state medical exam in connivance with senior officials, teachers and many middlemen- hit headlines that he realised that he was trying to win a fixed match. Pandey eventually cracked NEET but decided to work towards greater transparency in the medical education system , filing around 1,000 RTIs since 2016. Though no one paid heed to his warnings in May, they are paying attention now.""When the 'leak' stories came out, we had a small group of 50 students who were disturbed by the reports. Now our support group has expanded to 4,500,"" Pandey says, adding that there are lakhs who are now up in arms against the NTA.Like Pandey, Kota-based educator and students rights' advocate Dr Amit Gupta regularly posts videos sharing the plight of aspirants, amassing nearly 30,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter). Gupta, who completed his MBBS but decided to become a teacher instead, began his 'activism' in 2015 after the AIPMT paper leak. ""I gathered about 2,000 students, and we decided that enough was enough. Every time the cheaters just get away,"" Gupta says. The group held rallies and dharnas, demanding a re-exam. However, they soon realised that taking the judicial route would bear more fruit. Eventually, the SC ruled in their favour.Since then, 46-year-old Gupta has been fighting for other reforms too. This year, after the NEET results row, Gupta began helping students out to file petitions. Years of experience in fighting legal battles have come in handy as his lawyers help students draft petitions and crowdsource legal fees. ""If students take a single exam on one date with a single question paper in offline mode, there are bound to be leaks. Why can't we adopt the JEE model where multiple question papers are prepared and exams are held on different dates online?"" he asks.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that there have been any leaks calling the allegations motivated. But the turmoil among students and parents has been hard to contain.Students Islamic Organisation of India too has been vocal in its protests on the exam. The group has about 10 lakh students in their network who look to them for career guidance or funds as many belong to economically deprived backgrounds. SIO national secretary Abdullah Faiz says they received 300 complaints from students related to NEET discrepancies. ""Then we saw reports about grace marks being given without a proper explanation, paper leaks in Bihar and Gujarat and six toppers from just one centre in Haryana. We decided to file a petition as we no longer trust the agency conducting the exam."" SIO also conducted a survey among its students and found 64% had encountered problems like delayed start or early finish of the exam while 48% found discrepancies or errors in their scorecard. The most troubling thing, Faiz says, is that controversies surrounding the exam had impacted the mental health of over 70% of students.Desperate students have hit social media, organised street protests and petitioned influencers and politicians. The recent controversies also prompted Dr Dhruv Chauhan, national council coordinator with the Indian Medical Association Junior Doctors Network, to request a re-examination. ""Students have approached me saying they feel helpless. They and their families spend years planning and preparing for a medical career. Their faith has been shaken,"" Chauhan says.Among the other petitioners are coaching institutes such as PhysicsWallah's Alakh Pandey and students like 19-year-old Andhra student Jaripiti Kartheek who took the exam for the third time. Even with the result of 506, he finds himself at a rank of 200520 which makes state medical colleges out of reach. ""So many of the students who sat for the exam are struggling. NTA should change its approach-divide the courses and branches, and conduct different exams for each,"" he says.",The Supreme Court has now issued notices to the Centre and NTA on these alleged leaks. RTI activist Vivek Pandey says he had posted about these 'leak paper' offers on social media platforms even before the test. Pandey has been filing complaints with the Union health ministry on the problems with NEET-UG.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111045367,imgsize-37030,width-400,resizemode-4/111045367.jpg"

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. The nature of that encounter is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid,” said Sullivan.Asked about the issue by reporters accompanying the president, Sullivan said the US will continue to raise the issue, like in the past, at the highest level with India. “We have made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels,” added the official.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region.

Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder. Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played a key role in the case. Girish grilled four men who claimed to be part of the torture squad. The four men said they were offered money to go to jail.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

|

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

NEW DELHI: The Speaker of the 18th Lok Sabha is likely to be elected on June 26 but speculation over who will be the candidate of the ruling alliance shows no signs of abating.Days after the opposition INDIA bloc insisted that the Lok Sabha Speaker 's post must be allocated to the 'kingmakers' of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) -- the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party -- different opinions have cropped up in the BJP-led bloc.The BJP won 240 Lok Sabha seats – 32 short of the majority mark. With 16 and 12 Lok Sabha seats respectively, N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) emerged as the kingmakers, becoming indispensable for the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third government.While the JD(U) has said it will back the BJP's pick for the Speaker post, the TDP suggested that the partners of the ruling alliance must finalise a consensus candidate.""The NDA partners will sit together and decide who our candidate for the Speaker is going to be. Once a consensus is reached, we will field that candidate and all partners, including the TDP, will support the candidate,"" TDP national spokesperson Pattabhi Ram Kommareddy said.The contest for the position as of now seems to be between Daggubati Purandeswari, the BJP's Andhra Pradesh president, and GM Harish Balayogi, a first-time TDP MP from the Amalapuram constituency.

Held discussions with stakeholders: LS speaker on relocation

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha chairperson and vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday inaugurated the 'Prerna Sthal' in the Parliament complex. This newly established site now hosts statues of national icons and freedom fighters that were previously scattered across the premises.Dhankhar stated that the 'Prerna Sthal' aims to inspire and motivate people. This comes amidst the Congress party's criticism over the relocation of the statues from their original spots.""Imagine the contribution of these great personalities in the history of India. In which period were these great people remembered? I saw such a situation in the Central Hall. I became an MP in 1989, after that the change happened continuously,"" he said, seemingly alluding to the era of coalition governments at the Centre.The event was attended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh, Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, and his deputies Arjun Ram Meghwal and L Murugan. Information and broadcasting and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was also in attendance.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar, previously situated at prominent locations within the Parliament premises, were often gathering points for opposition protests against the government.Previously, the outer lawns of Parliament housed statues of various national icons such as Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Hemu Kalani, Mahatma Basaveshwara, Kittur Rani Channamma, Motilal Nehru, Maharaj Ranjit Singh, Durga Malla, Birsa Munda, Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, and Chaudhary Devi Lal.These statues have now been relocated to the newly created enclosure at the 'Prerna Sthal.'Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that the purpose behind the relocation and its grandiose naming was to ensure the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar were not placed conspicuously in front of Parliament House, where MPs could hold peaceful democratic protests as needed.Congress accused the govt of making the decision without any consultation and said that it violates the essence of democracy. There are around 50 such statues or busts throughout the Parliament House.Releasing a statement on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that previously, the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar were thoughtfully placed in prominent spots. These locations, he said, were chosen after careful deliberation.""The statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditative posture located right in front of old Parliament building held immense significance for India’s democratic polity. Members paid their respects at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi imbibing within themselves the spirit of Mahatma. It is at this place that members often conducted peaceful and democratic protests, drawing strength from their presence,"" wrote Kharge.Kharge said that even the statue of Ambedkar had been placed at a vantage point conveying the powerful message that he is extolling the generations of parliamentarians to steadfastly hold on to values and principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. ""Incidentally, during my student days in mid 60s, I was in the forefront demanding for installation of statue of Babasaheb in the precincts of the Parliament House,"" he further wrote. ""All this has now been brought to a naught in an arbitrary and unilateral manner.”Congress said that there is a designated committee known as the 'Committee on the Installation of Portraits and Statues of National Leaders and Parliamentarians in the Parliament House Complex.' This committee includes MPs from both Houses. However, this committee has not been reconstituted since 2019.""Such decisions made without any proper discussion and deliberation with relevant stakeholders are against the rules and traditions of our Parliament,"" added Kharge.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that the change came after discussions with various stakeholders, adding that the statues’ relocation is part of a broader effort to enhance the landscaping and beautification of the premises.Addressing the media, Birla said that the relocation involved continuous discussions with different stakeholders. He noted that this decision falls under the responsibilities of the Lok Sabha Speaker.""None of the statues have been removed, they have been relocated. There is no need to indulge in politics on this,"" Birla stated in response to opposition criticism regarding the move.He added, ""From time to time, I have been discussing these issues with different stakeholders. People were of the view that having these statues at one place will help disseminate information about their lives and achievements in a better way.""",Rajya Sabha chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday inaugurated the 'Prerna Sthal' in the Parliament complex. This newly established site now hosts statues of national icons and freedom fighters that were previously scattered across the premises. This comes amidst the Congress party's criticism over the relocation of the statues from their original spots.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111041840,imgsize-2020402,width-400,resizemode-4/111041840.jpg"

CM Siddaramaiah defends hike in petrol and diesel prices

BJP to stage protests across Karnataka against

fuel price hike

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government 's announcement of hike in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3 per litre and Rs 3.02 per litre respectively has garnered strong reactions from opposition leaders and residents.(Inflation has increased exponentially)!"" reacted Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri. ""After not fulfilling the promises of transferring Rs 8500/month to a woman of each family, Congress ruled Karnataka government has saddled the people of Karnataka with the burden of paying Rs 3/litre more for petrol and diesel in the state,"" the BJP leader wrote on X.""After this decision, people of Karnataka would be forced to pay higher amounts for food items, clothing, medicines and all items of basic necessities as fuel prices directly impact prices of all goods. Such a decision just after elections have been concluded, exposes the hypocrisy of the Congress which talks about mehengai but levies approximately Rs 8litre-Rs 12/litre additional VAT in comparison with BJP ruled states,"" he added.Puri said that Karnataka petrol prices are now Rs 8.21 per litre more expensive compared to BJP-ruled states Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Comparing Karnataka with BJP-ruled Arunachal Pradesh, Puri said petrol costs over Rs 12 per litre less while diesel is Rs 8.59 per litre cheaper in Arunachal.""During the last three years of global energy turmoil, the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji deftly diversified India’s crude oil purchases to ensure that petrol prices actually decreased by about 14% and diesel prices fell by nearly 11% during November 2021 -May 2024 period. During the same period, US saw petrol prices soar 29%, while neighbours Pakistan and Sri Lanka faced severe financial stress due to spike in global crude prices,"" Puri wrote.Puri said that while the world was facing fuel price surge due to a war in Europe, India remained the only country during that period where petrol and diesel prices went down. ""To maintain availability and affordability of transport fuels, Modi government made substantial and timely cut in excise duty in November 2021 and followed it up with another cut in May 2022. The Central govt reduced petrol and diesel prices by Rs5 per litre and Rs10 per litre, respectively, in November 2021. Following up in May 2022, petrol and diesel prices were further cut by ₹8 per litre and ₹6 per litre, respectively. Again on March 14 this year, the OMCs played a vital role in reducing prices further by Rs 2/litre.""""The BJP-run state governments aligned with the pro-people policies and reduced sales tax on transport fuels to further cut rates for the public and rein in inflationary pressures. For instance, petrol prices in Congress-ruled Telangana is Rs 12.76/litre higher than in UP. The difference in diesels prices between these two states is also significant at Rs 7.89/litre. Similarly, the petrol prices are Rs 9.29/ litre higher in Trinamool Congress-run West Bengal compared with BJP-run Gujarat,"" he added.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah stood behind the decision to raise petrol and diesel prices, explaining that the increase will fund essential public services and development projects.""The Government of Karnataka has increased VAT on petrol to 29.84 per cent and on diesel to 18.44 per cent. Even after this hike, our state's taxes on fuel remain lower than most South Indian states and similar economy-sized states like Maharashtra,"" the CM said in a statement.""Karnataka's VAT adjustment ensures we can fund essential public services and development projects. The state remains committed to balanced and responsible governance,"" Siddaramaiah emphasised.Siddaramaiah pointed out that despite the VAT hike, diesel prices in Karnataka are still lower than in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. ""We remain committed to keeping fuel prices reasonable for our citizens,"" he added.Karnataka leader of opposition and BJP leader R Ashoka announced that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will organise a protest on Monday against the state government’s hike in fuel prices. The demonstration will involve bullock carts and bikes stationed in front of the Vidhana Soudha.R Ashoka stated, ""We are against the increase in petrol and diesel prices by the state Congress government. Tomorrow, we are going to protest at Freedom Park in Bangalore at 11:30 am. This protest will be led by BJP State President BY Vijayendra and myself. We are going to protest against the Congress government across the state. The Congress government has increased the price of petrol and diesel because people did not vote for the Congress party in this Lok Sabha election.""Ashoka, along with BJP MLC Chalavadi Narayanaswamy, unveiled a poster pointing out that Congress leaders had previously protested fuel price hikes under the prior state government. ""Previously, Siddaramaiah protested during the price hike during our government,"" R Ashoka said.Siddaramaiah's video byte was also released by R Ashoka in which he said that if he comes to power, he will reduce the price of petrol.R Ashoka further said, ""Siddaramaiah is an outgoing CM. He will not hesitate to sell the Vidhan Sabha while leaving the post of CM. Congress has given misfortunes in the last one year after coming to power. The people of Karnataka are being oppressed. He increased the price of milk and stamp duty. Electricity tax and house tax have been increased.

'No attempts to saffronise

curriculum'

'We want to create positive citizens'

NEW DELHI: NCERT 's director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said on Sunday that teaching about riots in school textbooks would not have a ""positive"" impact on the citizens and create ""violent and depressed individuals"". He was referring to the changes made regarding chapters based on Gujarat riots and Babri masjid demolition .In an interview to PTI, Saklani said, ""Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens not violent and depressed individuals"".Saklani's remarks came after the release of updated textbooks that feature numerous omissions and alterations. The revised Class 12 political science textbook describes the Babri Masjid as a ""three-domed structure"" and has reduced the Ayodhya section from four pages to two. It has also removed specific details that were present in the previous version of the textbook.The recent revisions in the textbooks involve removing references to BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath to Ayodhya in Gujarat, the involvement of 'kar sevaks' and communal unrest following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the imposition of President's rule in BJP-governed states, and the BJP's statement expressing regret about the events in Ayodhya.Responding to allegations of saffronisation in curriculum and textbooks, Saklani said, ""If something has become outdated, it should be updated. There's no reason it shouldn't be changed. I don't see this as saffronisation. We teach history to provide students with factual knowledge, not to turn it into a battleground.""Talking about the deletions made in textbooks that include role of 'kar sevaks' in Babri Masjid demolition, Saklani said, ""If Supreme Court has given a verdict in favour of Ram temple, Babri masjid or Ram janmabhoomi, should it not be included in our textbooks, what is the problem in that? We have included the new updates.""If we have constructed new Parliament, should our students not know about it. It is our duty to include the ancient developments and recent developments,"" he added.""There are no attempts to saffronise curriculum, everything is based on facts and evidence,"" he said.Regarding accusations of saffronisation in the curriculum and textbooks, the 61-year-old told PTI, ""If something has lost relevance, it should be updated. Why shouldn't it? I don't see any agenda here. Our goal in teaching history is to educate students with factual information, not to turn it into a contentious issue.""""If we are telling about Indian Knowledge System, how can it be saffronisation? If we are telling about iron pillar in Mehrauli and saying Indians were way ahead of any metallurigical scientist, are we saying wrong? How can it be saffronisation?"", he added.Suggested that there is not the same level of outcry regarding the absence of the 1984 riots from textbooks, Saklani said, ""Should we teach our students in a manner that they become offensive, create hatred in society or become victim of hatred? Is that education's purpose? Should we teach about riots to such young children ... when they grow up, they can learn about it but why school textbooks.""""Let them understand what happened and why it happened when they grow up.

It will be followed by meetings with functionaries of states that will go for assembly elections in coming months.

Sources said Congress will effect an organisational reshuffle in AICC and state units after the string of meetings where the role of party chiefs and managers will also be assessed. Of special concern is the sub-par performance in Karnataka and Telangana, where the party recently came to office with a solid performance, and Himachal Pradesh, where the party won a good majority but failed to win any of the four seats in the parliamentary elections. The party also performed poorly in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu, in a repeat of 2014 and 2019 polls.

The review is likely to start later this month. The issue came up for discussion in the recent CWC meeting held to discuss the 2024 election results. The party also wants to quickly finalise the strategy for Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, which will go for assembly elections in the coming months.

Party sources said J&K may go for polls later, and it is crucial that the unit readies itself on the difficult turf.

Under the plan, there will be a limited off-the-shelf purchase of the Strykers under the foreign military sales (FMS) programme of the US, which will be followed by joint production in India, and finally there will be co-development of its futuristic versions, sources said.All this, however, is contingent on the Stryker meeting the operational requirements of the Army's mechanised infantry battalions as well as a high level of indigenisation and transfer of critical technologies to the Indian co-production partner, which could be a defence PSU or a private firm.""If the Stryker project is finalised, the existing Indian capabilities in ICVs will be taken into account. Strykers will have to be customised and technologically configured for Indian terrain, including operations in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Sikkim,"" a source said.With the Army having a huge requirement of futuristic wheeled and tracked ICVs to progressively replace its existing fleet of over 2,000 Russian-origin BMP-II vehicles in the years ahead, MoD is also pursuing indigenous projects. "" Army also needs ICVs capable of amphibious operations in large numbers as well. Strykers are not amphibious,"" another source said.The US is hard-selling the Strykers. Ahead of US national security advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to India, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin cited the ""co-production of armoured vehicles with India"" as yet another indicator of the upward trajectory in the bilateral defence partnership during the Shangri La dialogue in Singapore two weeks ago. The US, incidentally, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth around $22 billion since 2007. While the Stryker project is still in the discussion stage, India and the US are conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for inking two mega deals within this financial year.The first is acquisition of 31 armed MQ-9B high-altitude, long endurance drones and associated equipment for $3.9 billion, as reported by TOI earlier. The second is the co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of tech for around $1 billion.","India and the US are now in an ""advanced stage of talks"" for the proposed joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles.

NCERT chief: Riot lessons in texts can create 'violent citizens',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncert-chief-riot-lessons-in-texts-can-create-violent-citizens/articleshow/111043771.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rejecting accusations of saffronisation of the school curriculum , NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani clarified that references to the Gujarat riots and Babri Masjid demolition were modified in school textbooks to avoid creating ""violent and depressed citizens"".Textbooks have seen several crucial topics dropped or altered. The assertion that ancient DNA from the Rakhigarhi site rules out Aryan immigration, leading to calls for more research into whether the Harappans and Vedic people were the same, has been removed. Also omitted is a detailed table of Mughal emperors' achievements. Other deletions include BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath to Ayodhya, the role of kar sevaks, communal violence after the Babri Masjid demolition, President's rule in BJP-governed states, and BJP's ""regret over the happenings in Ayodhya"".The new Class 11 political science textbook claims political parties prioritise minority groups' interests for ""vote bank politics"", leading to ""minority appeasement"", a shift from the 2023-24 session's focus on the lack of evidence for this idea. Additional changes include dropping references to the Babri Masjid demolition, the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots, Hindutva, and tweaking the reference to Manipur's merger with India.During an interaction with PTI, Saklani emphasised that these tweaks were part of the annual revision process and should not stoke a controversy. ""Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens. Should we educate our students in a way that makes them offensive or creates societal hatred? Teaching about riots at a young age is unnecessary; they can learn about these events as they grow up,"" he said and pointed out that there was no similar outcry over the absence of the 1984 riots in textbooks.Saklani's comments come as new textbooks, featuring several deletions and changes, were released. The revised Class 12 political science textbook now refers to Babri Masjid as a ""three-domed structure"" and focuses more on SCjudgment that allowed the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site, rather than the details of the Ayodhya issue. This judgment led to reconstruction of the temple with the consecration performed by the PM on Jan 22.Responding to allegations of curriculum saffronisation, Saklani said, ""If something has become irrelevant, it must be changed... We teach history based on facts, not to create conflicts. Talking about the Indian knowledge system or the metallurgical advancements demonstrated by the iron pillar in Mehrauli is not saffronisation. These are facts.""Saklani, who was head of the ancient history department at HNB Garhwal University before becoming NCERT director in 2022, has faced criticism over these textbook changes, particularly concerning historical facts.","NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani rejects accusations of saffronisation of the school curriculum.

Between Wednesday and June 25, FM Nirmala Sitharaman is slated to meet economists, farm sector exports, market participants, bankers and labour unions, among others.Besides, on Saturday, she will meet state finance ministers to seek their inputs on the Budget, before joining them for the GST Council meeting in the afternoon.While the proposal for expanding PLI to more sectors has been on the table for a while, including to speciality chemicals where European companies are retreating, there have been issues around the size of investment that should be promoted by govt as large global champions are sought to be created in India.The details of the MSME package are yet to be firmed up but the idea is to empower small businesses, which were a focus of the post-Covid scheme too, so that there is enough impetus to create employment in the largest sector after agriculture.Jobs, both in terms of quantity and quality, have been a key concern during the polls and many see BJP falling short of the majority mark as a fallout of the widespread discontent on this count. There have been multiple suggestions to increase income levels for women, and increase their participation in the workforce, including through some tax arrangements. Officials said the proposals will be discussed in detail as women are a key target group for NDA.","Jobs, both in terms of quantity and quality, have been a key concern during the polls.

NEW DELHI: Taking a serious view of the row over National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to medical colleges, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency that conducts the exams, would be spared if irregularities were found, and interests of all students who took the test would be protected. Govt is looking at reforms to ensure that such problems do not occur in future.Pradhan, who took charge of the key portfolio last week, noted that ""some irregularities in NEET have come to light from some specific locations"" and assured students that these would not be tolerated.""Some irregularities have come to light in two places. I assure students and parents that govt has taken this seriously. Even if big officials of NTA are found guilty, they will not be spared. A lot of improvement is required in NTA. The govt is concerned about this, no culprit will be spared, they will get the harshest punishment,"" Pradhan said.NTA and the education ministry are looking into allegations of paper leak at some centres in Patna, which has been flagged by local police although govt officials maintained that the number of candidates who cleared the exams from these centres was not significant. Usually, as a matter of abundant precaution, there are two sets of papers, with the final one to be used decided on the morning of the exam.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency, would be spared if irregularities in NEET were found. The assurance came amid attacks from the opposition over NEET-UG, where 23 lakh candidates appeared on May 5. The results were declared on June 4, and NTA has come under severe criticism, amid allegations of irregularities, inflated marks and paper leakin the medical entrance exam.Stating that information on alleged irregularities have emerged from some specific places, Pradhan said, ""Govt is working towards its resolution and reform. Keeping the cognisance of the (Supreme) court, specific action has been initiated. Everything is being done under supervision of the court.""The minister added that the govt was committed to 100% transparency for an important exam like NEET. ""The Supreme Court itself is keeping an eye on the matter. We will not let anything wrong happen .""Earlier on Friday, Pradhan had indicated that scrapping the entire entrance examination was unlikely as the sanctity of the process could not be judged by alleged irregularities in a handful of centres. Some states with a large presence of a powerful lobby of education institutes have been opposing NEET and officials argued that coaching centres were fanning the controversy as the syllabus was aligned with Class 12, helping more students secure high marks.Officials said of the 4,750 centres, concerns were expressed in the case of eight centres as less time was given in some of these centres, resulting in NTA giving grace marks.","Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said no one, including officials of National Testing Agency, would be spared if irregularities were found.

The security forces will also comb the forested and undulating terrain for terrorists holed up there with an intent to create unrest and communal flare-up among the region's mixed Hindu-Muslim population.At a review meeting chaired by him here on Sunday, home minister Amit Shah directed security agencies to use ""innovative means"" and replicate the successes achieved in Kashmir region over the past few years - as reflected in the sharp decline in terrorist attacks and law-and-order-related incidents in the traditional Valley hotbeds, record flow of tourists and high voter turnouts in recent Lok Sabha polls - by rolling out an area domination plan and zero-terror plan in the Jammu division that seems to be the new target of Pakistan-based terror outfits .Shah, in a separate meeting, reviewed security and other arrangements for Amarnath Yatra beginning June 29. Among measures stressed by him to make the yatra secure and hassle-free for devotees were tracking their movement and that of yatra vehicles through RFID tags, deployment of sufficient security personnel, proper sanitisation of routes, fortification of camps and disaster preparedness.Both meetings were attended by NSA Ajit Doval, J&K LG Manoj Sinha and officials from MHA, J&K, Army, paramilitary forces & intel agencies.Pointing to Modi govt's resolve to uproot terrorism in all its forms through ""innovative means and seamless coordination among various security agencies"", Amit Shah said the fight against terrorism in J&K was in a decisive phase. He emphasised on seamless coordination among security agencies, identifying vulnerable areas and addressing the security concerns of such areas. Reiterating govt's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and commitment to crack down on terrorists through ""innovative means"", he directed all security agencies to work in a mission mode and ensure quick response in a coordinated manner.Sources told TOI that the revised counter-terror strategies for Jammu region shall include returning to the force deployment pattern of the 1990s, with more personnel guarding the mountain tops, resuming and intensifying counter-operations sector-wise and strengthening village defence committees in all districts in Jammu by refining their training and equipping them better to bust future terror strikes .""The deployment levels of J&K police, central paramilitary forces as well as Army troops will be considerably enhanced in the Pir Panjal region,"" a senior officer said.With higher force deployment expected to boost the intelligence flow and reduce response time to alerts on the presence or movement of terrorists in Jammu region - which unlike the flat-floor Valley has a difficult terrain with limited road and communication connectivity - counter-operations will be intensified in the days to come. Any local support to terrorists in Jammu division, like Kashmir, will invite serious consequences.Good flow of intelligence followed by quick response by counter-terror forces helped to curb terrorist activities in the Valley, an officer said and added that the strategy will now be replicated in Jammu.",Security forces will dominate the mountain tops to tackle fresh infiltration bids by terrorists from Pakistan.

The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high,"" Musk wrote on X, sharing a post by Robert F Kennedy Jr which cited media reports about hundreds of voting irregularities related to EVMs in Puerto Rico.Chandrasekhar argued that Musk's view may be applicable to the US and other places where regular computing platforms are used to build ""internet-connected voting machines"".""This is a huge sweeping generalisation statement that implies no one can build secure digital hardware. Wrong,' he added.Rajeev Chandrasekhar added, ""Indian EVMs are custom designed, secure and isolated from any network or media - no connectivity, no bluetooth, wifi, internet, ie, there is no way in. Factory programmed controllers that cannot be reprogrammed.""He said EVMs could be ""architected and built correctly"", as India has done, and even offered to run a tutorial for Musk on the subject.Replying to this, Musk said, ""Anything can be hacked.""Chandrasekhar agreed that ""anything is possible"", at least in theory. ""With quantum compute, I can decrypt any level of encryption.

"Russia kept out of Ukraine meet, India doesn’t sign communique",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-absent-india-refuses-to-endorse-peace-communique/articleshow/111043270.cms,"NEW DELHI: The issue of Russia ’s absence loomed large at the peace summit in Switzerland, as India joined over a dozen other countries in not signing a joint communique that declared any peace agreement must be based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. India backed out saying abiding peace isn’t possible in the absence of options acceptable to both sides, as the summit also could not elicit the kind of support Ukraine was hoping for from the Global South.Among others who did not back the communique, which was endorsed by 84 countries and organisations out of the 100 that participated, were important Indian BRICS partners like Brazil, South Africa and UAE apart from countries in the extended neighbourhood like Indonesia and Thailand.Saudi Arabia, Armenia, Bahrain, Colombia, Libya, Mexico and Suriname also didn’t sign on to the document. Given the efforts to keep Russia out, and Moscow’s own reservations about the summit, India was represented, as reported by TOI on Saturday and even earlier, only by a secretary-level official at the 2-day summitthat ended Sunday. India never considered participation at the highest or even ministerial level.Justifying India’s decision to not associate itself with any communique/document emerging from this Summit, MEA secretary (west) Pavan Kapoor, who led the Indian delegation, said in India’s view only those options acceptable to both parties can lead to abiding peace. ``In line with this approach, we have decided to not associate with the joint communique or any other document emerging from the summit,’’ said the official.The foreign ministry said in a separate statement a lasting and peaceful resolution requires ``sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict’’.``India’s participation in the Summit, as well as in the preceding NSA/Political Director-level meetings based on Ukraine’s Peace Formula, was in line with our consistent approach to facilitate a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy,’’ said the Indian statement, alluding to Modi’s repeated assurances to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that India would do everything within its means to support a peaceful solution.However, India and others who did not endorse the communique had doubts about whether the peace summit would be able to achieve its objective of ``just peace’’ in the absence of Russia, the main party to the conflict along with Ukraine. The Indian government also said India will continue to remain engaged with all stakeholders as well as both the parties to contribute to all ``earnest efforts’’ to bring about an early and abiding peace.The communique said that the UN Charter and “respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty can and will serve as a basis for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine’’. Zelenskyy had called Modi earlier this year to seek a high-level participation for the summit. He later also sent his foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba to India to explain the efficacy of his 10-point peace plan. India’s position on any peace process is also in line with the stand taken by China, which boycotted the summit altogether, that it’s imperative for such an initiative to involve both Russia and Ukraine.",India joined over a dozen other countries in not signing a joint communique that declared any peace agreement must be based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
