Security agencies prepared for all eventualities as Hasina headed towards India in an Air Force jet.Around 3pm, Indian Air Force radars detected a low-flying aircraft approaching the Indian border from Bangladesh.Air defense personnel, aware of the high-profile passenger onboard, allowed the aircraft to enter Indian airspace. To provide security, two Rafale fighter jets from the 101 squadron at Hashimara air base in West Bengal were deployed over Bihar and Jharkhand, according to ANI.The aircraft followed its designated flight path, closely monitored by ground agencies, with constant communication between the plane and top Indian security officials. Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and General Upendra Dwivedi, the chiefs of the Indian Air Force and Army, respectively, closely monitored the situation.A high-level meeting was held with intelligence agency chiefs, General Dwivedi, and Lieutenant General Johnson Philip Mathew, the Integrated Defence Staff chief.As Hasina's jet landed at Hindan air base around 5:45pm, she was greeted by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. They held an hour-long meeting, discussing the current situation in Bangladesh and her future plans. Doval then briefed the Cabinet Committee of Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been kept informed throughout the day.Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country. Her resignation came after a violent crackdown on protests that had grown from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-fledged movement demanding her ouster.As news of Hasina's exit spread, volatile crowds took to the streets, with some vandalizing the statue of her father and Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.In an address to the nation, army chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman announced that an interim government would be formed and that he had met with members of most political parties, taking full responsibility for the country.",Bangladesh plunged into chaos on Monday following Hasina's resignation and departure from the country.

NEW DELHI: On the fifth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 , PM Narendra Modi on Monday recalled the legislation passed by Parliament on Aug 5, 2019, as a ""watershed moment in the country's history"", which, he said, heralded a new era of progress and prosperity in J&K and Ladakh regions. The PM assured people of J&K and Ladakh that his govt would keep working for them and fulfil their aspirations in the coming times.""Today, we mark five years since the Parliament of India decided to abrogate Articles 370 and 35(A), a watershed moment in our nation's history,"" Modi said in a post on X.""It meant the Constitution of India was implemented in these places in letter and spirit, in line with the vision of the great men and women who made the Constitution.""With abrogation (of Article 370) came security , dignity and opportunity for women, youth, backwards, tribal and marginalised communities who were deprived of the fruits of development, PM Narendra Modi said. “It ensured that corruption, which plagued J&K for decades, has been kept at bay,” he added.Home minister Amit Shah, who anchored passage of the legislation, termed abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A as a transformative decision, ushering in a new era of empowerment for marginalised sections and strengthened grassroots democracy in J&K and Ladakh.“The region’s youth have driven socio-economic growth and cultural revival, making Modi govt’s efforts to foster peace and comprehensive development a grand success. We thank Modi for this landmark decision & reaffirm our dedication to advancing the region’s aspirations and transformative progress,” he said.Meanwhile, in the foreword of a book on the legislation, ‘370: Undoing the Unjust, A New Future for J&K’, the PM said, “There was complete clarity in my mind that taking the public in J&K into confidence was absolutely essential for execution of the decision.”“We wanted the decision, whenever it would be taken, to happen with concurrence of the people rather than imposition,” he said.The book, researched and written by non-profit organisation BlueKraft Digital Foundation, was published under the Penguin Enterprise imprint. It is scheduled to release this month.","The PM assured people of J&K and Ladakh that his govt would keep working for them and fulfil their aspirations in the coming times.

SC validates LG's unilateral nomination of 10 aldermen to MCD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-validates-lgs-unilateral-nomination-of-10-aldermen-to-mcd/articleshow/112302593.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big setback to AAP govt , the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is empowered by a Parliament enacted law to unilaterally nominate 10 aldermen to Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and is not bound by the aid and advice of the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala said the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, after the 1993 amendment by Parliament, has expressly empowered LG to nominate persons with special knowledge to the MCD on his own.“The context in which the power is located confirms that the LG is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute and not to be guided by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,” it said greenlighting the LG’s decision to nominate 10 members to MCD on Jan 3, 2023, a month after AAP won 134 of 250 seats in the elections to the MCD. BJP had won 104 seats.The blow for Kejriwal government clears the way for election for the Standing Committees of MCD. Mayor Shelley Oberoi, who belongs to AAP, has refused to constitute the Standing Committee, crucial for the functioning of the city as every project exceeding Rs 5 crore in value to be cleared by them, by citing Delhi government's challenge to the nomination of aldermen by LG. SC 's rejection of the argument may clear the way for constitution of the vital bodies.AAP govt had moved SC directly challenging the constitutional validity of 10 nominations by the LG. Senior advocate A M Singhvi had argued that the Constitution mandates a governor to strictly go by the aid and advice of an elected govt. LG through senior advocate Sanjay Jain had defended the nominations citing his exclusive powers under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act, 1993.Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha referred to the 2023 judgment of 5-Judge bench led by CJI Chandrachud, which while declaring that bureaucracy was within the domain of the elected government, that had ruled that “if Parliament makes a law in relation to any subject in List II and List III (state and concurrent lists), the executive power of Delhi government can be limited to the extent as provided under the Parliament-enacted law.“Having examined Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the DMC Act empowering the Lt. Governor to nominate persons having special knowledge to the DMC, we will underscore the point that it is law made by Parliament. As the law requires the LG to exercise the power of nomination, it satisfies the exception contemplated under Article 239AA(4) to act in his discretion as he is by or under any law so required to act,” he said.The bench said, “The statutory power under DMC Act to nominate persons of special knowledge was vested in the LG for the first time by the 1993 amendment to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 to incorporate the Constitutional changes through Articles 239AA, 239AB and introduction of Part IX-A relating to municipalities. The power to nominate is therefore not a vestige of the past or a power of the Administrator that is continued by default. It is made to incorporate change in the Constitutional structure of NCTD.”After delineating legislative and executive relationship between the Centre and Delhi government and a threadbare analysis of provisions of DMC Act, Justice Narasimha said, “The provisions of the Act relating to the LG are relating to matters such as nomination of experts, Election Commissioner, constituting Finance Commission, convening the first meeting of the Corporation, acting as an appellate authority, etc. These functions seem to suggest that they are intended to enable the authority (LG) in which the power is vested to act as an independent body.""","Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala said the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, after the 1993 amendment by Parliament, has expressly empowered LG to nominate persons with special knowledge to the MCD on his own. “The context in which the power is located confirms that the LG is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112302591,imgsize-916908,width-400,resizemode-4/112302591.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former minority affairs minister and senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has urged the Waqf system to move beyond its ""touch-me-not"" syndrome, following the government's plan to introduce a Bill to amend the 1995 law governing Waqf boards. This amendment aims to ensure more accountability and transparency in their functioning and mandates the inclusion of women in these bodies.Sources indicate this move is in response to demands from within the Muslim community .The proposed Bill would require Waqf boards to register their properties with district collectors to establish their actual valuation.Naqvi expressed his views through a post on X, emphasizing the need for the Waqf system to adapt and modernize.""The Waqf system will have to come out of the madness of 'touch-me-not' syndrome-politics,"" Naqvi stated.He further commented on the resistance to change, saying, ""communal attack on inclusive reforms is not right.""Several Muslim organizations and clerics, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board , have expressed their opposition to the proposed amendments . They believe any interference with the legal status and powers of Waqf boards is unacceptable.All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has criticized the government's move, claiming it seeks to undermine the autonomy of Waqf boards. He accused the BJP-led NDA government of having an agenda against Waqf boards and properties.""The BJP has been against Waqf boards and Waqf properties 'from the beginning' and it has made attempts to finish these as per its 'Hindutva agenda',"" Owaisi asserted.","Former minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi urges Waqf system to move beyond its ""touch-me-not"" syndrome.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge. Initially ruled lbw by the on-field umpire, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge technology indicated a spike near the bat, leading TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the decision. Kohli's relief was evident as he smiled following the reversed call.The decision did not sit well with the Sri Lankan players. Kusal Mendis expressed his frustration by throwing his helmet to the ground, and Asalanka conveyed his displeasure to the on-field umpire, Raveendra Wimalasiri. Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya also came down from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire.Despite the reprieve, Kohli's innings was short-lived. Four overs later, Vandersay bowled Kohli with a flipper that trapped him in front of the middle stump. Although Kohli considered another review, his partner Axar Patel dissuaded him, resulting in Kohli's departure.As Kohli approached the Sri Lankan unit for the customary post-match handshake, Jayasuriya stopped him for an intense but brief chat. The exchange ended amicably, with both men patting each other on the shoulder.India now face a do-or-die situation in the third ODI in Colombo on Wednesday, needing a win to level the series.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in second ODI in New Delhi.

CBI arrests conman 'dead' for 20 years living in sadhu's disguise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cbi-arrests-conman-dead-for-20-years-living-in-sadhus-disguise/articleshow/112299273.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: He was declared ""dead"" two decades ago by a court here, after he disappeared with Rs 50 lakh following a bank fraud . On Sunday, when CBI sleuths arrested him after a lengthy and coordinated operation, he was disguised as a sadhu in a village in Tamil Nadu.But this was only one of many identities he took on over the years as he traversed the length of the country to keep the investigation agency guessing.It all started on May 1, 2002 when CBI registered a case against V Chalapathi Rao, then a computer operator with SBI's Chandulal Baradari branch at Hyderabad, for allegedly cheating the bank of Rs 50 lakh. He had obtained loans allegedly using fabricated quotations from electronics shops and fake salary certificates made out in the names of his family members and close associates. CBI filed two chargesheets in the case in Dec 2004 after which Rao went missing.His wife, also an accused in the fraud case, lodged an FIR with the Kamatipura police station officials on July 10, 2004, stating that her husband was missing. In 2011, she filed a petition in the civil court here to declare her husband dead as he had been missing for seven years.The court issued a decree declaring him dead.According to information gathered by CBI, Rao fled to Salem in Tamil Nadu and married another woman in 2007 after changing his name to M Vineet Kumar. He also obtained an Aadhaar number in that name. Through his second wife, CBI officials found out that Rao was in touch with his son from the first marriage. In 2014, he left Salem without informing anyone and moved to Bhopal, where he worked as a loan recovery agent. He then went up further north to Rudrapur in Uttarakhand, where he worked at a school. When a CBI team reached Rudrapur, it found that Rao had fled from there in 2016. ""With the help of email IDs and Aadhaar details in the name of M Vineet Kumar, CBI approached Google's law enforcement department. These details revealed that Rao had gone to an ashram in Verul village in Aurangabad,"" CBI officials said. He had changed his name to Swami Vidhitatmanand Teertha and had obtained another Aadhaar card. But in Dec 2021, he left the ashram allegedly after cheating its managers of Rs 70 lakh.""Subsequently, Rao moved to Bharatpur in Rajasthan and stayed there until July 8, 2024. He left Bharatpur and reached Tirunelveli to stay with one of his disciples. CBI received credible information that the accused was planning to escape to Sri Lanka by sea. Officials finally tracked him down and arrested him on Sunday from Narasinganallur village in Tirunelveli.","V Chalapathi Rao, then a computer operator with SBI's Chandulal Baradari branch at Hyderabad, for allegedly cheating the bank of Rs 50 lakh.

But everything is in a state of flux now,” a source said.Just a month ago, Bangladesh had inked a deal with Indian defence shipyard GRSE in Kolkata to build an 800-tonne advanced ocean-going tug, in the first major deal inked under the $500-million line of credit for defence purchases extended by New Delhi to Dhaka, which was operationalized last year.The contract coincided with Navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi’s four-day visit to Bangladesh to further consolidate defence ties and explore new avenues for maritime cooperation. Admiral Tripathi held discussions with Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman as well as the naval and air force chiefs, Admiral M Nazmul Hassan and Air Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan, during the visit.“Talks were underway for Bangladesh to buy Indian offshore patrol vessels as well as get spares for maintenance for its Russian-origin MiG-29 and Mi-17 helicopters. Apart from joint exercises and capacity-building programmes, Indian military establishments have been training Bangladeshi defence personnel for decades,” the source said.The Indian defence establishment is now in a wait-and-watch mode to see how events unfold in Bangladesh, including the interim govt’s composition and its impact on bilateral military ties.“Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman is pro-India. As the principal staff officer of the Armed Forces Division of Bangladesh earlier, he co-chaired with the Indian defence secretary the bilateral annual defence dialogues in 2022 and 2023,” another source said.“But if the interim govt is filled with representatives from the anti-India Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and radical outfits like Jamaat-e-Islami, matters may well head south. The Jamaat has also spread its influence in the Bangladeshi military over the years,” he added.Then, there is China. Bangladesh was the second biggest recipient globally of Chinese arms in the 2019-2023 timeframe, notching up 11% of them as compared to 61% of Pakistan.Overall, Bangladesh sources 70-80% of its arms imports from China, which has ranged from F-7 fighter jets, main-battle tanks and corvettes to naval guns, surface-to-air missiles, rifles and ammunition.China had even supplied two old Ming-class submarines to Bangladesh at a hugely discounted price in 2016. Apart from a wide variety of civil infrastructure projects, China has also helped Bangladesh build its first full-fledged submarine base at Pekua in Cox’s Bazaar, which was commissioned as BNS Sheikh Hasina in Dec last year.",Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman was in fact slated to visit India later this month. India was poised to take its traditionally good defence- military ties with Bangladesh on a sharp upward trajectory. But the fleeing of Sheikh Hasina from her country on Monday has injected an air of uncertainty into the entire equation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112297945,imgsize-58868,width-400,resizemode-4/112297945.jpg"

Centre: Landslides tied to Kerala governments' neglect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-landslides-tied-to-kerala-governments-neglect/articleshow/112302327.cms,"TOI

Background

NEW DELHI: Blaming the successive Kerala governments for its sheer neglect of environmental factors that led to the Wayanad disaster , Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday said the local government did not pay attention to “expansion of illegal human habitation and mining” in ecologically fragile areas , and kept on allowing such activities over the years that led to the devastating landslides on July 30.“Such activities were allowed by the state in the past 10 years without keeping in view the soil topography, rock conditions, mountain slope, vegetation structure and overall geomorphology of the ecologically fragile region,” said Yadav.Records show that the Kerala government gave approval to as many as nine projects, including four of mining , in the state during the past three years (2022-24) whereas environment ministry permitted one project - construction of twin tunnel between Anakkampoyil Kalladi-Meppadi in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts - during the period. On ministry’s approval, Yadav said that the lone project was approved in-principle (stage-I) and the construction has not yet started there.The minister said he now expects the Kerala government to work with a central committee and give its consent to the sixth draft, issued by the centre on July 31, for notifying ecologically sensitive area (ESA) within its jurisdiction of the Western Ghats at the earliest so that environmentally hazardous activities including mining and big construction projects could be immediately prohibited.Referring to the sixth draft, he said the Centre is ready to notify ESA in a phased manner if one or the other state individually or collectively agrees for it. The move, as reported bylast week, will hasten the process of notifying ESA state by state without waiting for the consensus from all the six states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goal, Maharashtra and Gujarat - at the same time.In a departure from the previous drafts that expected all six states to come on board simultaneously, the latest draft made a provision where final notification of Western Ghats ESA can be done in a “phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification”.The draft proposes earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ESA to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats, spread over six states. The proposed ESA comprises of 9,993 sq km in Kerala; 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, recommending prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting (Red category) industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of the existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting (Orange & White categories) industries.The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdiction in the Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014 but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry had issued four more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.The central govt and an expert committee had discussed the fifth draft with states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - nine times during July, 2022-March, 2024 but it could not finalise the ESA notification due to objection from states - initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa and later mainly from Karnataka.The then Karnataka govt even requested the Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect the livelihood of people due to ban on certain activities.The draft, however, clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","Kerala government gave approval to as many as nine projects, including four of mining, in the state during the past three years.

Significant decline in terror-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir under Modi government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/significant-decline-in-terror-related-incidents-in-jammu-and-kashmir-under-modi-government/articleshow/112298859.cms,"NEW DELHI: There has been a 69 per cent dip in terror-related incidents and a 67 per cent fall in resulting casualties in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government , as compared to the records from UPA’s term between 2004 and 2014.As per official data on J&K security situation shared by home ministry sources, organised stone pelting incidents, organised hartals, civilian deaths in stone pelting incidents and injuries to both civilians and security forces personnel due to stone pelting were down to ‘zero’ last year from a high of 2654, 132, 112 and 6235 respectively in 2010.Sources said terror related incidents were down from 7217 between 2004 and 2014 to 2263 between 2014 and July 31, 2024 (69 per cent decline), with civilian killings down to 353 from 1769 (80 per cent fall) and security personnel deaths down to 591 from 1060 (44 per cent decline) in the same period.“The Modi regime has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to terror in its quest to make J&K terror-free. The strategy includes a tough security actionplan, neutralising the capabilities and efforts of terrorists, checking local terror recruitment and radicalisation of youths by keeping them gainfully engaged, and adopting a multi-focal approach to check infiltration,” a senior MHA official told TOI.While stone-pelting incidents came down from 1328 in 2018, the year prior to abrogation of Article 370, to ‘nil’ in 2023, ceasefire violations on Indo-Pak border fell from 390 in 2018 to 9 last year and 3 from January to June this year.Terrorist-initiated attacks were down to 46 in 2023 and 11 between January to July this year, from 228 in 2018. As many as 91 security personnel were killed in 2018, which declined to 30 in 2023 and 17 until July 31 this year. Civilian killings in terrorist-initiated encounters fell to 14 both in 2023 and till July 31 this year from 55 in 2018.MHA sources told TOI that the decline in terrorism is thanks to measures taken to dismantle the terror eco-system, such as attachment and freezing of properties linked to terror, collective disposal of UAPA cases and dismissal of govt employees and denial of govt benefits like passports and public contracts to anybody found linked to terror.Another key change since 2019 is keeping the J&K police the lead in counter-terror operations.NIA and J&K SIA have registered 22 terror financing cases in which 229 persons have been arrested and assets worth Rs 150 crore and 57 properties sealed. Another 90 properties were attached and 134 bank accounts frozen in terror financing cases.“As many as a dozen terrorist organisations and 37 individuals were banned under UAPA,” said an officer.“Thanks to these steps since 2019, the G-20 tourism working group conference was held successfully in Srinagar. As many as 4.5 lakh pilgrims participated in Amarnath Yatra in 2023 and Moharram procession was taken out in Srinagar after a gap of 34 years, in which 40,000 persons and J&K LG Manoj Sinha himself took part,” said an MHA officer.","There has been a 69 per cent dip in terror-related incidents and a 67 per cent fall in resulting casualties in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government.

As a precautionary measure in view of the anniversary, no fresh batches of Amarnath Yatra pilgrims were allowed to depart from Jammu during the day.The firings in the two locations occurred past midnight.The first was in Akhnoor’s Battal around 1.30 am, the sources said. “The troops fired some rounds on observing suspicious movements in a forward area in Sunderbani sector in Rajouri district around 12.30am. The firings, however, drew no retaliation in both places,” said an official.Extensive searches were launched in the two areas at the first light of day to ensure no one had sneaked in across the border, the sources said.In Jammu on Monday, the authorities at the Amaranth Yatra base camp took no chances because of the Article 370 abrogation’s anniversary and clamped a one-day pause on departures. “No fresh yatra batch was allowed through the Baltal or Pahalgam routes. Security has been beefed up,” an official said.Troops have been on high alert as terrorist attacks in the Jammu region since June 9 have killed 10 Army soldiers, a CRPF constable, and nine civilians, including seven pilgrims. Less than a fortnight ago on July 23, the army had foiled an infiltration bid in Battal sector of Poonch, triggering a gunfight that left a soldier injured.Earlier, on July 18, BSF troopers had resorted to firing after observing suspicious movements along the LoC in the Daddal area of Sunderbani and followed it up with searches, thwarting possible attempts at infiltration.","Troops opened fire after noticing movements of suspected infiltrators along the Pakistan border in Akhnoor and Sunderbani sectors of Jammu.

But on Tuesday he will make his maiden appearance at the Olympics in Paris alongside defending champion Neeraj Chopra in the qualifications.However, he will have to do incredibly well to make it to the final round which will be held on Thursday. A total of 32 athletes divided into two groups of 16 will be taking part in the qualification and only 12 will make it to the final.Besides Neeraj, he will be competing with world No. 1 Jakub Vadlejch, two-time world champion Anderson Peters, reigning European Games champion Julina Webber and Commonwealth Games champion Arshad Nadeem among others.Jena, however, hasn’t been at his best this year. Starting his season at Doha Diamond League meet on May 10, his best throw was just 76.31m. Five days later, at National Federation Senior Athletics Competition in Bhubaneshwar, he disappointed once more with a throw of 75.49m.Next he took part at Indian Championships in Panchkula in June. He made a slight improvement from the last event in the qualification round and made a throw of 77.69m. To his relief in the finals, for the first time this season he breached the 80m mark with a throw of 80.84m but at Paris Diamond League meet last month he failed to perform once more. His best was just 78.10m that helped him finish eighth among 10 athletes.Despite the recent struggles, hiscoach Samarjeet Singh Malhi believes he will not disappoint at the biggest stage.“It’s all part and parcel of sports. We, after all, have been working to peak at the Olympics so there’s nothing to worry. Also he already qualified for the Olympics earlier and hence he didn’t have to push himself to earn qualification,” said the coach, a former javelin thrower himself, during a conversation last month.“Moreover, taking part in his maiden Diamond League meet wasn’t easy at the beginning of the season. He also had an injury in his left ankle and he struggled because of that.”After competing in Paris Diamond League early last month, Jena trained in Spala, Poland, ahead of the Games, and Malhi is more than happy with how it went. “We worked mainly on his speed. Also training there has helped Jena get acclimatised to the weather and the conditions that will be there in Paris,” said the coach.Besides his final preparations in Poland, Jena also had a training stint in Australia earlier this year where he worked on his blocking technique and one hopes all this hard work will eventually pay off.“Playing for the country at the Olympics is enough motivation for him. He is fit, has worked hard and has everyone’s blessings. So I’m confident that he will perform well,” the coach added.While Jena now gets set for Paris, one can’t help but think of the conversation that Jena, who was considering quitting the sport at that point, had with his father last year following which he decided to take part in the Sri Lankan Championships and threw 84.38m during the event to grab the gold.It was just what he needed to continue his love affair with the sport and he might be able to carry it on in the city of love.",Javelin thrower Kishore Kumar Jena had almost given up the sport last year.

In the entire tenure, this government did not take the metro forward even an inch in Haryana, including Palwal,” he said.“The government did not lay a new railway line, did not build any big university, did not build any big hospital, did not complete and start any new medical college, did not set up any big industry and did not install any power plant. Still, this government put the state in debt of 4.5 lakh crores. Today, neither new industries are coming to the state, nor is the state getting new investments, and as a result new employment is not being generated,” he stated.“Haryana has become the number one state in unemployment, crime and drug abuse. More than 2 lakh posts are lying vacant in government departments, but permanent jobs are being abolished through schemes like Agniveer and Kaushal Nigam,” he added.Hooda promised that these vacant posts will be filled through permanent recruitments after the formation of the Congress government. “The elderly will be given a pension of Rs 6000 and the employees will be given the benefit of the old pension scheme. The poor will get free treatment worth Rs 25 lakh in Haryana, on the lines of the Congress government of Rajasthan,” he promised.“Three hundred units of free electricity and gas cylinder for Rs 500 will be given to provide relief from inflation.

Deora also highlighted the ""four Cs"" which, according to him, were of concern for the country. The four factors outlined by him included: ""China, City and Commuting and Climate Change.""Sir, I am grate that you have given me the time to support the President's address. Sir, I am very fortunate that my maiden speech in this august House responds to the Honorable President's very articulate outlining of the government's plans ahead for the next five years and highlights the government's achievements over the last ten years. Sir, I am also extremely fortunate to have your esteemed presence in the chair during my maiden speech for which I thank you, sir.Sir, before I begin my speech, if you permit, I would like to remember my late father, Mr. Murali Deora. When he passed away, he was at that time a member of this august House and he always taught me to stand up for myself and to keep loyalty for the country before loyalty for the party. Sir, I am sure today he is with me to guide me on this journey, on this new journey I should say, sir, and to bless me.Sir, in many ways, life has come full circle because in 1977, 47 years ago, the late Balasaheb Thackeray supported my late father to become mayor of Mumbai's financial capital, Mumbai. And today, 47 years later, at the age of 47, I am disclosing my age, the president of the Shiv Sena, Mr. Eknath Shindeji, the chief minister of Maharashtra has enabled me to represent Mumbai, Maharashtra and India through the Shiv Sena in the Rajya Sabha. Sir, for the first time in India's history, we have an Adivasi woman President of India. And we have a leader who hails from a very, very humble background.When people say that democracy is under threat, I want to answer them that the fact that an ordinary person who was selling tea on a railway track is now the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy proves that India's democracy is strong, India's constitution is strong. In Maharashtra too, sir, the chief minister, a very simple auto rickshaw driver, we have auto rickshaws in a certain part of Mumbai, an auto rickshaw driver rose to become the chief minister of the country's second-largest state, the most industrialised state. This means for someone who is young and is watching us today that our democracy is in fact stronger than ever before.Sir, many people, my former colleagues who are not here today, who I am sure when their chance comes to speak and through the public domain have been analyzing the Lok Sabha results in many, many ways. But the fact remains as few people before me have pointed out that Narendra Modi Ji is only the second Indian to be sworn in as Prime Minister of India for three consecutive terms. The first being Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru exactly 62 years ago in 1962.In fact, something which has not been said before me for the sake of not being repetitive, to give this house a sense of how high anti-incumbency levels are around the world and this is due to a variety of factors. There is a growing aspirational demanding voter, social media is playing a role in making people more impatient. Demographic transitions are underway.In the last 10 years alone, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji has seen and I will count down, 6 Prime Ministers of Pakistan, 5 Prime Ministers of the UK, 4 Presidents of Sri Lanka, 3 Presidents of the USA, 2 Presidents of France and finally, after Sushma Swaraj Ji, after a decade, one Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. So Sir, Modi Ji ka abhi bhi poora 5 saal ka karekaal baaki hai aur isi liye main Eknath Shinde Ji ke aur se, Shiv Sena ke aur se, Maharashtra ke aur se, Maananiya Pradhan Mantri Ji ko apne dil ke gherayee se badhai dena chahata hoon, unki Sarkar ke sabhi sadasyon ko bahut bahut shubh kamnaye dena chahata hoon. Sir, chunavi bhaashanon mein, main aksar mazaak mein kaha karta tha ki, yadi aap INDI Alliance se, I hataoge yaani INDIA se, yadi aap I letter ko hataoge, toh aapko NDA dikhai dega.If you remove I from INDIA, you get NDA. My point I am making is that despite all our political differences, I still believe that there is more that unites us than divides us. And a new beginning must call for a starting afresh.I am starting afresh and I believe that as we move from confrontation to collaboration, (6:43) we must replace the letter I with V. Sir, I wish to bring to your attention four Cs, the letter C, that I am sure everyone across this house will agree with me on. And we can rise above politics and agree that these are issues which concern our country. Some will see them as challenges, I personally see them as opportunities.So the first C is China, the second C is cities, the third C is computing and the fourth C is climate change. All of these in varying degrees have been spoken about by the Honourable President. Sir, when we talk of China, the first C, today both the West and the Global South, the developed world and the developing world, have a trade deficit with China.But in addition to a trade deficit, they also have a trust deficit with China. And India in that sense is very, very unique. (8:03) India today enjoys a trust surplus with the rest of the world.Sir, today global investors, global companies are adopting what they call a China plus one strategy. What that essentially means is that for the last 20 or 30 years, most of these companies moved their manufacturing from Western countries to China. They created jobs in China, they strengthened China's economy and as a result today, they are seeing geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea and other parts of the world.Today, those same companies, those same countries, those same investors, are moving investments, diversifying their factories to countries like India, to countries in the neighbourhood, maybe Vietnam and Bangladesh. And as rightly pointed out by the Honourable President of India, Sir, she made a very interesting remark. She said we must enhance cooperative federalism in our country between centre and states but far more importantly, competitive federalism between states.I have always been a firm believer that if states compete aggressively against each other, that is what will make India truly competitive globally. My good friend Jayant Choudharyji is here. I congratulate him, Sir, through you for becoming a minister.I was just telling him now that as a skills minister, as a young minister of skills development, one area that we can focus on is upskilling our workforce. Today, we remain very low in terms of the number of women in our workforce. If we look at our immediate neighbours in South Asia, if we look at our neighbours like Vietnam in Asia, they have a much higher participation of women in our workforce.Having a program where we can upskill women in the workforce will be very, very useful for our country's economy. And now I believe is the time for India leveraging on this China plus one strategy to become a leader not just in South Asia but in all of Asia.And the leader of Asia today as we all know will be the leader and the super power of the world.Sir, second C is cities. My close associate from Maharashtra spoke about urbanization. Many people see urbanization as a challenge.Sir, I am a Rajya Sabha MP from Maharashtra but Mumbai is my birthplace, my birthplace. I have a special place in my heart for Mumbai. And I believe what Mumbai is today, India will be tomorrow.Sir, today when we talk of urbanization, in our country only one-third of Indians or 48 crore Indians live in cities. The rest live in rural areas. Conversely, in a country like China, two-thirds of China lives in cities and one-third lives in rural areas.But the number of Indians living in cities in five or six short years is going to rise from 48 crore people to 59 crore people. Sir, in Mumbai, today the population of Mumbai is 2 crore and in 5 or 6 years, Mumbai's population will become 3 crores. How we take advantage of this urbanization? (12:02) How we plan our cities effectively? This will allow us to reap a demographic dividend.Sir, I certainly invite your esteemed self, sir, to visit Mumbai. I would through this speech invite many of my fellow MPs. In the last few years, massive transformations are underway in the city of Mumbai where we are trying to absorb the influx of people, urbanization from rural to urban areas.And this is very, very critical for our economic growth. Sir, the third C I mentioned is computing. The honourable IT minister was in the house.I was hoping during my speech I would be able to draw his attention in some ways to this issue. But, sir, superpowers of the 19th and 20th century were the countries that dominated the industrial revolution. The countries that become the superpowers of tomorrow, of the 21st century, will become countries that dominate in the area of artificial intelligence.And, sir, every industry has a raw material. Artificial intelligence, which is being discussed on a large scale all over the world, the raw material of artificial intelligence is data. And today, India is going to become the world's largest producer of this raw material.Today, the average Chinese person is consuming 32 GB of data per day. The average Indian is consuming only 24 GB of data per day.But, Mr. Rijiju ji, in the next four years, India will become the largest data consumer in the world.The average Indian will consume 62 GB of data per day. We will be surpassing America, all of Europe, and even China. What does data mean? Data means that whenever we watch a video on WhatsApp, watch a video on YouTube, go to Facebook, Instagram, the data that we are using, the raw material that we are generating in India, that raw material is accruing value in companies in America, in Silicon Valley.I believe, sir, it is time for us to leverage that raw material, to leverage that natural resource, and to build the next Google, to build the next Facebook, to build the next WhatsApp coming right here out of India. That is what can give us superpower status. And that, I believe, is the vision of the Prime Minister under the Digital India Initiative.Sir, the fourth C I mentioned is climate change. Sir, a few days ago, in fact, in Delhi and Noida, it is a pity that due to the heat wave, some people died. Sir, who were these people who died? They were not, unfortunately for them, privileged people like us.They were ragpickers. (15:27) They were manual laborers. They were security guards.Sir, fortunately today in Delhi, I can say that we have brought some good weather from Mumbai. There is some monsoon weather here. But, sir, I am glad that the Honorable President, in her speech, spoke extensively.Mr. Sudhanshu Trivedi, who initiated this debate, he also referred to that point, that the President of India spoke extensively about the greening of India's economy. Sir, the Prime Minister has set a very ambitious target for this country, to become net zero. By the year 2070.Once again, sir, many people will see this as a threat. I see the greening of India's economy as a massive opportunity for us to invest in the industries of the future. Today, sir, India can become a world leader in offshore wind energy.I read today that the government is using production linked incentives that the cabinet approved recently, to incentivize industry to generate electricity through offshore wind. In green hydrogen, the government has a very ambitious plan to build electrolyzers in India. Even with an open mind, we should think of nuclear.Even in a small area, sir, like seaweed cultivation, which I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister once again, that if anyone spearheaded seaweed cultivation in India, it was the Prime Minister when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. And sir, seaweed is the food of the future. The Japanese, sir, as we know, have been eating seaweed for centuries and they have the highest life expectancy.Seaweed is becoming an organic substitute for fertilizers. When it is mixed with fodder, it reduces methane gas emissions from cows and India is a big livestock population considering that we are the biggest dairy consumer and dairy producer. (17:30) My dear friend, Mr. G.K. Vasan is here.Sir, if you go to Tamil Nadu, the entire coast of Rameshwaram, the farmers are growing seaweed in abundance and exporting that. These are small industries which we should think about. Climate change, in my opinion, is an opportunity.Sir, I will give you two small examples. Today, there is a war between Russia and Ukraine in Europe. Almost all of Europe was entirely dependent on Russia for their energy needs.Because of the war, Europe is forced to invest in innovative green technologies of the future. Wind energy, nuclear energy. Similarly, sir, you will recall, in the 70s, when the Arab-Israel war happened, and at that time, the Arab countries decided that they will not export oil to America.America experienced what was called the oil shock. Petrol pumps were empty. Nobody could fill petrol and diesel.That was the first time, under that time's president, Jimmy Carter, when the first investment was made in photovoltaic solar technologies, which gave birth to solar energy. So, sir, every challenge presents, in many ways, an opportunity. Until such time, as India becomes a world leader, creates technologies of the future, I am glad that the government is using production-linked incentive schemes to incentivize and reduce our dependence on the supply chain that is dominated by countries like China, especially in electric vehicles, especially in solar, even going beyond climate change in the areas of semiconductor chips.Sir, semiconductor chips is something now, in every car, on every tablet, on every table of every MP, everything requires that microchip. And Taiwan, small country, has in some ways a monopoly producing almost 95% of the world's chip. I congratulate this government for diversifying from Taiwan and for bringing semiconductor plants in India for the first time.Sir, I said that this is the time to be bold, to be decisive, and for the government to act. For the first time, as I said, in 62 years, there is a third consecutive term government. Sir, I would like to share an interesting example of a neighboring country in Asia, which has many similarities with India and it can be applied in some ways to India.Sir, Singapore. The founding father of Singapore and the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, who I have had the pleasure to meet several times. And he was a very good friend of India.He was a well-wisher of India. Sometimes people wonder when they go to Singapore, how did this man, in a short span of time, how did he transform a former British colony, where most of the people lived in slums, there was no healthcare, there was rampant illiteracy, there were ethnic tensions, there were communal riots. Sir, he took three simple but very controversial decisions at the time.I am in no way advocating those decisions for India, but I am just pointing it out when I talk about being bold. His first decision, he said, despite the fact that in Singapore, there were Indians, largely our Tamil brothers and sisters, there were ethnic Chinese, there were Malays, people from Malaysia. e said, I want everyone to speak English, because that is the language of the future and that is what will make Singaporeans employable globally.Second thing he did was, he said, I want to attract the best talent from around the world to come live, work in Singapore and strengthen the economy of Singapore. The third thing he did, which I think everyone will agree with, he said, politicians must be paid salaries equal to the private sector,so that there is no corruption whatsoever. And sir, he achieved honestly nothing short of a miracle.Sir, my limited point, a third consecutive term government is historic, it is a record government, the world is watching India, there are global tailwinds, being from Mumbai, I meet a diverse section of people, people want India to succeed. It is for us to be bold, it is for us to be decisive, it is for us to act very, very aggressively. Sir, before concluding my speech, the reason I am not taking my, sorry, I have already reached 22 minutes, I thought I have not reached.Sir, before concluding my speech, thank you, thank you. Sir, before concluding my speech, I would like to highlight something that the honourable President said about this government's achievement. But I believe that there is one achievement, one achievement, which stands out above all achievements.And I say this as a Mumbaikar. Sir, under this government,) cities like Mumbai, have been completely eradicated of terror attacks during the last decade. Regrettably, this was a regular feature.Sir, I have represented Mumbai, I was the MP of South Mumbai when 26-11 happened. From 2006, there was a train blast. There was 26-11 in 2008.There was the Zaveri Bazaar and the serial blasts in Mumbai.All of this has been eliminated. At that time alone, 400 people died.Sir, I believe national security of our country is paramount. If we want to grow our economy, we want investors to come here, we have to ensure that our national security is protected. Our national security remains stronger than ever.And I congratulate this government for ensuring that, not just in a city like Mumbai, but across the country. Sir, with these words, I didn't realize I have already crossed 24 minutes,but I am extremely grateful to you, sir, for the time and for being present in the chair while I make my maiden remarks. Thank you very much.Thank you.","Former Congress leader Milind Deora ended his family's 55-year association with the party in January.

CBI: From banker to swamiji: The unbelievable tale of a fugitive’s capture.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-banker-to-swamiji-the-unbelievable-tale-of-a-fugitives-capture-/articleshow/112296919.cms,"HYDERABAD: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a proclaimed offender in a bank fraud case, who had been declared dead by the court despite disguising himself as a Swamiji to deceive the CBI .The arrested accused, V. Chalapathi Rao, frequently changed his identity and location to avoid capture .It all started on May 1, 2022, when the CBI registered a case against Chalapathi Rao, then a computer operator at SBI Chandulal Biradari Branch, Hyderabad, on allegations that he cheated SBI out of Rs.50 lakh. The accused obtained loans using fabricated quotations from electronic shops and fake salary certificates created in the names of his family members and close associates, misappropriating SBI funds. Upon completing the investigation, the CBI filed two chargesheets in December 2004. Since then, the accused had been missing.His wife, also an accused in the fraud case, lodged an FIR at Kamatipura Police Station on July 10, 2004, stating that her husband was missing. She also filed a petition in the Civil Court to declare the absconding accused as dead after seven years in 2011, following his alleged disappearance. A decree was subsequently passed by the concerned Civil Court of Hyderabad. As the key accused had been absconding, the case against him was split up, and upon completing the proceedings, he was declared a proclaimed offender in April 2013 in the CBI case.During the investigation, the wife of the accused obtained a stay from the High Court of Telangana on efforts to attach the property of Chalapathi Rao. The CBI stated, ""Chalapathi Rao resorted to numerous efforts including constantly changing locations, contact numbers, and identity. However, we relentlessly pursued leads and finally caught him in a village in Tamil Nadu.""According to information gathered by the CBI, the accused fled to Salem and married a woman in 2007 after changing his name to M. Vineet Kumar and obtaining an Aadhaar number. Through his second wife, the CBI learned that Chalapathi Rao was in touch with his son from his first marriage. However, in 2014, he left Salem without any information and moved to Bhopal, where he worked as a loan recovery agent, then shifted to Rudrapur in Uttarakhand, where he worked at a school.When the CBI team attempted to trace him in Rudrapur, they found that he had fled the place in 2016. ""With the help of email IDs and Aadhaar details of the proclaimed offender in the name of M. Vineet Kumar, the CBI approached Gmail's Law Enforcement Department. These details revealed that Chalapathi went to an Ashram in Verul village, Aurangabad. He changed his name to Swamy Vidhitatmanand Teertha and also obtained an Aadhaar card . However, in December 2021, he left the Ashram, where he allegedly cheated them out of Rs. 70 lakh.""Subsequently, the accused moved to Bharatpur (Rajasthan) as Vidhitatmanand Teertha and stayed there until July 8, 2024. He then left Bharatpur and reached Tirunelveli to stay with one of his disciples. During this period, Chalapathi changed contact numbers more than eight to ten times.The CBI received credible information that the accused was planning to escape to Sri Lanka by sea. Continuous efforts by the CBI to trace the proclaimed offender resulted in his arrest on July 4 from Narsinganallur village, Tirunelveli (Tamil Nadu), where he was hiding. A well-coordinated and calibrated effort by the CBI team resulted in tracing and apprehending the accused, who had been on the run for almost two decades, evading the law. He was produced before the Court of Special Judge for CBI Cases at Hyderabad and has been remanded to judicial custody until July 16. The trial in the case will commence soon.","The arrested accused, V. Chalapathi Rao, frequently changed his identity and location to avoid capture.

Body of Indian techie Siddhant Vitthal Patil recovered from US national park after weeks of search,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/body-of-indian-techie-recovered-from-us-national-park-after-weeks-of-search/articleshow/112267908.cms,"After weeks of searching, rangers at Glacier National Park in Montana have recovered the body of Indian techie Siddhant Vitthal Patil , a 26-year-old tech professional from India who fell into Avalanche Creek on July 6 and drowned.Patil, who was living and working in California at the time of the incident, was hiking with seven friends above a gorge on the Avalanche Lake Trail when he diverted from the path and fell into the creek while standing on a large rock.Despite briefly resurfacing, he was swept away by the current into the gorge.""After weeks of searching, rangers at Glacier National Park believe they have recovered the body of 26-year-old Siddhant Vitthal Patil from India today after Patil fell into Avalanche Creek on July 6, 2024, and drowned,"" said park officials in a statement.They added, ""Clothing and gear similar to what, according to friends, Patil was wearing at the time of the incident were also recovered. Around 10.30 am today (local time), a park visitor reported seeing a body in Avalanche Creek below the gorge. Rangers immediately began recovery efforts. Flathead County coroner is working to confirm identity through DNA or dental records.""The search for Patil's body was challenging due to submerged obstacles such as fallen trees and rocks, which limited the rangers' ability to investigate the gorge for weeks because of water depth and whitewater conditions during spring and summer runoff. As the water level dropped, rangers used long poles to search large portions of the gorge but were unable to reach the deepest and most dangerous areas.According to Glacier National Park officials, Patil was hiking with friends above a gorge on the Avalanche Lake Trail on July 6 when he diverted from the trail. While standing on a large rock, he fell into Avalanche Creek. It remains unclear whether he slipped on a wet portion of the rock or lost his balance. Friends and witnesses saw him fall into the creek, go underwater, resurface briefly, and then be swept away by the current into the gorge.""An alert helicopter conducted aerial searches of the creek, and rangers scoured the area on July 6, recovering personal items that had washed downstream. During the past four weeks, ground search efforts have continued from the gorge to the bridge on the Trail of the Cedars,"" added the statement from park officials.Rangers used a drone multiple times to search the gorge. The Trail of the Cedars and Avalanche Lake Trail were temporarily closed during the recovery efforts and reopened around 3:30 pm local time.Park officials extended their condolences to Siddhant Vitthal Patil's family and friends, expressing hope that recovering the body would help bring closure to his loved ones. Patil was living and working in California at the time of the incident.Siddhant's uncle Pritesh Chaudhari told news agency ANI that US ranger officials informed them about the recovery of Patil's body. Chaudhari expressed gratitude to the rangers and Indian American community leader Prem Bhandari for supporting the family during the search.""We were informed by the US ranger officials that Siddhant's body was found. As we are grappling with this grief, we also like to thank the rangers for carrying out this search. A special mention to Prem Bhandari who has been in constant touch with us for the last 27 days and supporting us. We have authorized Bhandari to arrange for Siddhant's remains to be sent to Pune and complete the formalities,"" Chaudhari told ANI.Prem Bhandari, a prominent Indian diaspora leader assisting in repatriating the mortal remains to India, stated that park officials offered their condolences to the family and hoped that recovering the body would help bring closure to loved ones. The next step is to repatriate the mortal remains to the grieving family. In a statement to ANI Bhandari said, ""When I spoke to the Park officials they offered condolences to the family and hoped that recovering the body would help bring closure to loved ones. The next step is to repatriate the mortal remains to the family.","Siddhant Vitthal Patil, a 26-year-old tech professional from India, fell into Avalanche Creek on July 6 and drowned.
