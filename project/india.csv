In a bid to transform the landscape of traditional crafts and rural economies, the Uttarakhand government has launched the House of Himalayas (HoH), an umbrella brand aimed at promoting authentic, handcrafted products from the region. Unveiled during the Uttarakhand Global Investor Summit 2023 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the initiative seeks to elevate the state’s rich heritage while empowering local producers and artisans.In a market increasingly driven by consumer demand for authenticity and sustainability, HoH stands out by offering high-quality, handcrafted goods that connect buyers to the culture and traditions of Uttarakhand.This initiative consolidates the state’s diverse range of products, from Himalayan wild forest honey to heritage-rich ‘Pahadi Rajma,’ ensuring each item carries a unique story of resilience and authenticity.The launch of House of Himalayas Ltd in April 2024, led by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami , has created a dedicated team of executives focused on positioning these Himalayan products in high-end markets. The brand aims to empower rural communities by providing training, branding support, and quality assurance, thereby fostering sustainable livelihoods and reducing rural-to-urban migration.Radhika Jha, secretary of rural development, emphasized HoH’s mission to uplift women artisans and small-scale farmers, stating, “This initiative is not just a commercial enterprise; it’s designed to strengthen the rural economy .”By adopting a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model, HoH partners with e-commerce platforms like Amazon Karigar, allowing consumers worldwide to access these premium products. The brand also plans to establish a physical presence in key locations, including Delhi International Airport, while actively participating in international trade fairs to enhance its market reach.Recent collaborations with major players, such as Lulu Hypermarket, have positioned HoH for a global presence, particularly in the Middle East. The brand has signed MOUs with the Spice Board of India and the Indian Institute of Packaging to enhance production and distribution capabilities.As consumer awareness around ethical sourcing and artisanal craftsmanship grows, House of Himalayas is well-positioned to meet this demand. With a product lineup that includes eco-friendly incense sticks and luxurious silk scarves, HoH aims to resonate with the conscious consumer segment while creating a lasting emotional connection through its offerings.This initiative not only aims to uplift local communities but also seeks to solidify Uttarakhand's identity in the global marketplace, setting the stage for sustainable economic growth across the region.","House of Himalayas is an umbrella brand aimed at promoting authentic, handcrafted products from the region.

Aasu terms SC seal on Sec 6A ‘historic’, ex-NRC coordinator flags data flaw

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday declared all Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam on or after Mar 25, 1971, as illegal migrants. Given the grave adverse impact they have had on the state's culture and demography, the Union and state govts must expedite their identification, detection and deportation, SC said.A five-judge bench delivered this verdict by four to one majority while upholding the validity of Section 6A of Citizenship Act, which was introduced in Dec 1985 in sync with the 1985 Assam Accord that Rajiv Gandhi govt signed with students' unions, which were agitating against massive illegal influx of Bangladeshis.The section's validity was challenged in SC on the ground that it differed from the cut-off dates prescribed in Constitution for grant of citizenship.Under Section 6A, those Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, would be deemed Indian citizens, whereas those who came to the state between Jan 1966 and March 24, 1971, were to be given citizenship after 10 years subject to certain conditions.While the majority opinion running into 185 pages, authored by Justice Surya Kant for himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, went beyond the validity of Section 6A and delved into the cultural and demographic crisis faced by inhabitants of Assam because of illegal influx of Bangladeshi migrants and prescribed remedial steps, CJI D Y Chandrachud stopped at upholding the validity of Section 6A. Justice J B Pardiwala dissented and quashed Section 6A prospectively.Illegal entry of Bangladeshis, which has been going on since the country's partition in 1947, has been a wedge issue with BJP and AGP campaigning against it as a threat to the country's integrity and security and a ""plot"" to change the demography in border areas, and their opponents accusing them of exaggerating the problem due to the Muslim faith of the illegal immigrants.The issue, which played a major role in BJP's rise as the dominant force in Assam at the expense of Congress and, interestingly, AGP, has already become a key theme in the approaching Jharkhand polls.Justice Kant dealt with the situation arising from unchecked infiltration of Bangladeshi migrants threatening to swamp Assam, and referred to a two decade-old judgment in Sarbananda Sonowal case in which the SC had observed that ""there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing 'external aggression and internal disturbance' on account of largescale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals"".""Immigrants who entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971, are not entitled to the protection conferred vide Section 6A and, consequently, they are declared to be illegal immigrants. Accordingly, Section 6A has become redundant qua those immigrants who have entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971,"" Justices Kant, Sundresh and Misra said.The majority held that the directions issued for identification, detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam after Mar 25, 1971, must be implemented expeditiously. Importantly, it said five laws - Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950; Foreigners Act, 1946; Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; and Passport Act , 1967 - must act in tandem to give effect to the legislative objective of Section 6A, that is not to permit any illegal Bangladeshi migrant to enter Assam after March 25, 1971.Finding that the SC's directives in the Sonowal judgment had not been implemented properly even after 20 years as only 97,714 cases were pending before Foreigners Tribunals even though millions of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have entered the state, the SC decided to monitor progress of detection and deportation of such migrants from now.""Implementation of immigration and citizenship legislations cannot be left to the mere wish and discretion of the authorities, necessitating constant monitoring by this court,"" Kant said.In his 94-page opinion, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The legislative objective of Section 6A was to balance the humanitarian needs of migrants of Indian origin and the impact of the migration on the economic and cultural needs of Indian states. The two yardsticks employed in Section 6A, that is migration to Assam and the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, are reasonable.""All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu), the force behind the six-year-long mass movement against infiltration that led to the Assam Accord of 1985, celebrated Thursday what it termed a “historic” second victory in the fight to save the state’s identity and demography after SC upheld the constitutional validity of the key citizenship clause brought by amendment to implement the tripartite agreement.Samujjal Bhattacharjya, Aasu’s chief adviser, said the SC ruling on Section 6A of the Citizenship Act “effectively endorses the Assam Accord” as the commitments in the pact hinge on implementation of this clause that was challenged in court. “We wholeheartedly welcome the SC verdict. It has established that the Assam agitation was undertaken for genuine reasons, and all provisions stand legally validated.”Senior Gauhati HC advocate Bijan Kumar Mahajan said people, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, ought to now acknowledge the sanctity of Section 6A. “Since our student days, we have faced the dilemma of whether 1951 or 1971 is the base year for determining citizenship. The wait is over. It is the beauty of the Indian judiciary that a Constitution bench of the apex court has upheld Section 6A by a 4:1 majority.”Abhijeet Sarma of Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the case that led SC to order an enumeration exercise to update the NRC in the state, described the validation of Section 6A as “a historic resolution of the controversy”.He flagged doubts about the authenticity of the data in the updated NRC and the delay in ordering its verification as a hurdle to implementing the Assam Accord despite SC’s order. “What about the future of the Assamese people? Even today, the answer to this question is an authentic NRC. SC’s verdict, in fact, highlights NRC’s relevance.”Retired IAS officer Hitesh Dev Sarma, the former NRC coordinator in Assam, was among those who struck a discordant note about SC upholding Section 6A as constitutionally valid. In a social media post, he termed the judgment “a disheartening development” and “a terrible day for Assam”.He said the BJP-led state govt not moving SC for a comprehensive review of the NRC may have already paved the way for citizenship to foreigners whose names were included in the updated citizenship rolls based on allegedly faulty credentials. “Chances are the current NRC with lakhs of foreigners’ names will now be declared the final document.”The core of Section 6A is that immigrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, will enjoy all rights as citizens, while those who came to the state between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, will be subject to checks and compliance with case-specific requirements.","Supreme Court declares all Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam on or after Mar 25, 1971, as illegal migrants. Given the grave adverse impact they have had on the state's culture and demography, the Union and state govts must expedite their identification, detection and deportation, SC said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114331280,imgsize-1428575,width-400,resizemode-4/114331280.jpg"

Saini also thanked the people of Haryana for their mandate and the PM for his “inspirational leadership.”“With full majority for the third time, the BJP govt will work with full energy for good governance, equality and welfare of the poor,” the CM posted on X. Portfolios of the newly inducted ministers are expected to be allotted on Friday when the first cabinet meeting has been called.Both the women ministers in Saini cabinet come from political dynasties of Haryana, as both their grandfathers served as CMs. While Shruti Chaudhary is granddaughter of former Haryana CM Bansi Lal, Arti Singh Rao is the granddaughter of former CM Rao Birender Singh.

The three independents, Savitri Jindal from Hisar, Devender Kadian from Ganaur and Rajesh Joon from Bahadurgarh, had backed the BJP, but didn’t make it.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi.

Noida School Molestation :'Don’t tell anyone at home': 3-year-old ‘molested twice’ in Noida school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/a-predator-targeted-my-daughter-twice-mother-speaks-out-after-sexual-assault-at-on-student-at-noida-school/articleshow/114298170.cms,"Representative Image

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NOIDA: A three-year-old student who was sexually assaulted allegedly by a housekeeping staffer of a frontline school’s junior wing on campus earlier this month was molested by the same man a few weeks ago, the child’s mother told TOI on Wednesday, pointing to the serious lapse that allowed a predator to target her daughter twice and questioning the school management’s attitude and response since she incident came to light.On Oct 4, the school worker had allegedly taken the child to the school’s medical room, locked its doors and sexually abused the child, the mother said.He allegedly leapt out of the window and fled when another staffer — a ‘didi’ — came looking on hearing the child’s scream. The mother claimed the child was eventually escorted back to her class by a teacher, but when asked about the incident, her imputation was that the girl may have seen some inappropriate videos online.She said her daughter refused to go to school on Oct 7 and complained of pain in her private parts. “We took her to a paediatrician and the doctor wrote some tests to check for infection. The next day, the doctor told us that there was no infection, but the child had been sexually assaulted,” she said.After counselling, the child told her parents that a man who served food to the kids at school — referring to him as ‘khana bhaiya’ — had pricked her private parts with a stick when she went to school on Oct 4.“‘Bhaiya danda karte hai’ she kept repeating. That’s when she told us that this was the second time that he had done so. A few weeks back, the same man molested the child when she was on a slide in the school’s playground,” the mother said.The child, she added, told them that she had reported the incident to her class teacher, but was told ‘gharpe mat batana’ (don’t tell anyone at home about the incident).“I called up the class teacher on Oct 8 and asked her about the two incidents. To my surprise, the teacher tried to brush away the incident and said that my daughter may have watched an inappropriate video online and may be telling the events as her own. I was taken aback, and asked the teacher that watching a video would not give my daughter pain, redness, and rashes in her private parts,” the mother said, adding she went to the police after this.The family submitted a complaint at Sector 20 police station the same day and an FIR was registered on Oct 9. The child’s statement was recorded before the Child Welfa re Committee (CWC) and she identified the accused from a set of pictures shown to her by the cops as a part of the probe. Subsequently, the 30-year-old housekeeping staffer was arrested from Nithari village on Oct 10 under BNS Section 65(2) (rape of a woman under 12 years). CWC member Dipti Yadav said the committee served a notice to the school and summoned the headmistress on Wednesday.The school’s headmistress, meanwhile, told TOI they got to know about the alleged sexual assault when a police team visited the school on Oct 9. “The parents did not talk to us about the incident before this,” she said.Deputy CP Rambadan Singh said in their complaint the parents did not mention the class teacher was informed about the incident earlier.The family said that they would withdraw their child from the school.","A three-year-old student who was sexually assaulted allegedly by a housekeeping staffer of a frontline school’s junior wing on campus earlier this month was molested by the same man a few weeks ago.

India Canada News: Justin Trudeau alone responsible for damage to India-Canada relations: MEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-confirms-india-on-trudeaus-admission-of-not-providing-hard-proof-on-nijjar-killing/articleshow/114297476.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar . The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that Trudeau's testimony before a public inquiry only confirms what New Delhi has been saying from the start—that Canada has provided no evidence to support the serious allegations made against India.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar’s assassination last year. Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time. He said, ""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point.""""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was...give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said let's work together,"" Canadian PM said.India swiftly rejected Trudeau’s statements, with MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, ""What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along—Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations it has levelled against India and Indian diplomats."" Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau’s responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar’s killing in British Columbia in June last year. India labelled the claims as “absurd” and part of a broader political move by Trudeau.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation. In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler. The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism. India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Canada’s initial accusation, made without clear evidence, had strained an already delicate relationship, especially over the issue of Canada allowing pro-Khalistani activities on its soil. India has consistently criticised Canada for providing space for such elements, accusing them of operating with impunity.","India has responded firmly to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent admission that his government had no ""hard proof"" when it accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

He is lying to distract from a Liberal caucus revolt against his leadership and revelations he knowingly allowed Beijing to interfere and help him win two elections,"" said the Conservative politician who enjoys nearly a double-digit lead in ratings over Trudeau in the build-up to polls next year.Poilievre also revealed that Trudeau, who through his senior aides conveyed to him serious allegations of India's interference in Canada 's internal affairs, had not backed up the charge though the law allows him the leeway to share the specific details. ""I was briefed on Oct 14 by Nathalie Drouin, national security and intelligence advisor to the PM; David Morrison, deputy minister of foreign affairs at Global Affairs Canada; and Daniel Rogers, director of CSIS; about the matter of foreign interference from India,"" Poilievre said, adding that Trudeau's team did not share details with him by taking the stand that they could not put any MP in a ""tough position"" without giving them due process. Poilievre said the stand of Trudeau's aides was just an excuse as ""CSIS Act allows the govt to offer any information to any Canadian about specific risks of foreign interference without forcing them into sworn secrecy or controlling what they say"".He also said it was the first time Trudeau's team had made the claim about India's interference and its links to Conservative MPs. The timing, Oct 14, of the Trudeau team's visit to Poilievre is also significant: it came on the eve of the deposition of the PM and members of PMO before the Foreign Interference Commission, the coincidence set to strengthen India's suspicion that the dispensation in Ottawa fired the second volley of allegations to distract attention from the hearings into charge that Trudeau allowed the Chinese a free run of his country.""If Trudeau has evidence to the contrary, he should share it with the public.

The findings also indicated that 83.2% of the world's poorest individuals reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.Meanwhile, low- income countries which comprise 10.2% of the population covered are home to 34.8% of all poor people (400 million).

Canada 'safe haven' for criminals wanted in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-safe-haven-for-criminals-wanted-in-india/articleshow/114327642.cms,"NEW DELHI: Canada may have taken the plea of free speech and cited legal requirement for more proof to act against pro-Khalistan extremists' alleged political persecution to find sanctuary in its territory, but the country has failed to act on India's requests even for extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.This has turned the country into a ""safe haven"" for criminals wanted in India, govt sources said.Sources here pointed out that no action has been taken against one Gurcharan Singh, accused in a cheating case, although a request was made in 2003. Similarly, Omkar Mal Aggarwal, accused of criminal conspiracy and cheating in a property case, has been wanted since 2016, while India sought the extradition of Jasvinder Pal Singh Walia in 2022 in a case related to gang rape and blackmail of a female employee of his spa during 2014-15, which is pending. Last year, a plea was made against Ravinder Singh for cruelty against his wife, after he fled the country.Sources said there are formal and informal channels via which information is exchanged but a common thread is there - reluctance on part of Canadian authorities.On several occasions, India has suggested that the Canadian govt check the antecedents of individuals who enter the country illegally and later seek asylum, but the suggestion has been ignored. Even the caution that the ""open door"" policy is a recipe for disaster, as those who have profited from crime are going to ply their dark trade in their new home, has not been heeded. ""Nor have the instances vindicating the warning,"" said a senior source.In the case of terrorists and criminals, Indian authorities have shared call details and even the location of suspects and suggested that action could be taken under Canadian laws but complained that they have always hit a wall.Sources also dismissed the grounds of ""higher bar"" and ""due process"" refrained by Canadian agencies to justify their action against terrorists entering the country camouflaged as ""dissenters who are facing prosecution for political reasons"" as just an alibi, saying the concerns have never come in the way of tough action against operatives and sympathisers of IS and their family members. ""The indifference and resistance to our requests... has been visceral and has been the norm since 2003,"" said the source.In fact, after years of informal sharing of information and dossiers, which Canada said didn't meet their legal requirements, a formal arrangement was worked out between NIA and RCMP but there has not been much headway.Even in the 1980s when militancy was at its peak in Punjab, Canada under then PM Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father, harboured Khalistani terrorists, including those involved in murders and bombings, including that of Kanishka that killed hundreds of passengers.In recent years too, as Sikh extremists decided to make Canada as their base for anti-India activities, govt repeatedly flagged its concern and shared evidence, including links with Pakistan, but has not met with much success. What has raised further eyebrows in New Delhi is how many extremists accused of serious terror charges have even been given official assignments.","Canada has failed to act on India's requests even for extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.

NEW DELHI: In validating Section 6A of the Citizenship Act that conferred citizenship to Bangladeshi migrants entering India before March 25, 1971, Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud in his opinion said this cut-off date was reasonable as on that day Pakistan army had launched ' Operation Searchlight ' to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in then East Pakistan.Agreeing with the majority opinion of Justices Surya Kant, M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra on the validity of Section 6A incorporated in the Citizenship Act to honour the Centre's commitment under the 1985 Assam Accord signed with students' unions, CJI Chandrachud said application of the provision only to Assam had a reasonable nexus with the magnitude of the problem faced by the state due to unabated influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh.Quoting M Rafiq Islam's book 'A Tale of Millions: Bangladesh Liberation War, 1971', the CJI said, ""On March 25, 1971, the Pakistan army launched Operation Searchlight to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in East Pakistan. The migrants before the operation were considered to be migrants of partition towards which India had a liberal policy. Migrants from Bangladesh after the said date were considered to be migrants of war and not partition. Thus, the cut-off date of March 25, 1971, is reasonable.""Referring to migrations from Bangladesh to India immediately after partition, the CJI said, ""Since the migration from East Pakistan to Assam was in great numbers after the partition of undivided India and since the migration from East Pakistan after Operation Searchlight would increase, the yardstick has nexus with the objects of reducing migration and conferring citizenship to migrants of Indian origin (that is person born in undivided India).""Justice Chandrachud referred to the Sarbananda Sonowal judgment expressing concern over Assam facing ""external aggression and internal disturbance"" due to largescale illegal migration from Bangladesh and rejected the challenge to Section 6A's validity based on the provision's application only to Assam even though West Bengal, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram shared longer borders with Bangladesh and faced illegal migrant influx.""Though other states such as West Bengal (2,216.7 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Tripura (856 km) and Mizoram (318 km) share a larger border with Bangladesh as compared to Assam (263 km), the magnitude of influx to Assam and its impact on the cultural and political rights of Assamese and tribal populations is higher,"" he said.""The data submitted by the petitioners indicates that the total number of immigrants in Assam is approximately 40 lakh, 57 lakh in West Bengal, 30,000 in Meghalaya and 3,25,000 in Tripura. The impact of 40 lakh migrants in Assam may conceivably be greater than the impact of 57 lakh migrants in West Bengal because of Assam's lesser population and land area compared to West Bengal,"" the CJI said.The petitioners, challenging the validity of Sec 6A, had argued that largescale entry of illegal migrants from Bangladesh and conferring them citizenship had jeopardised Assamese people's fundamental right to protect and conserve their culture.Rejecting this argument, the CJI said, ""First, as a matter of constitutional principle, the mere presence of different ethnic groups in a state is not sufficient to infringe the right guaranteed by Article 29(1)... Second, various constitutional and legislative provisions protect Assamese cultural heritage.""",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said this cut-off date was reasonable as on that day Pakistan army had launched'Operation Searchlight'to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in then East Pakistan.

In a surprising admission, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a prominent Khalistani extremist. The revelation comes at a time of escalating tensions between India and Canada , raising questions about the diplomatic storm that followed these unsubstantiated allegations.Trudeau, who was testifying before the foreign interference inquiry, acknowledged that when his government implicated New Delhi in Nijjar's assassination last year, they were acting on weak intelligence rather than definitive proof.Trudeau said, ""Over the course of summer I was apprised by intelligence services that govt was involved in the killing of Nijjar, there was not an obvious immediate international nexus... In August, intelligence from Canada and The Five Eyes made it clear that india was involved...agents from India were involved on Canadian soil and told them we have real concerns that your security agencies are involved. India's response to our investigation was to double down on attacks against our government...We told India it is not hard evidence but it is just intelligence at that point...India undermined our government and governance...These were clear indications that India has violated our sovereignty""He further said, ""They [India] asked us how much do you know? Give us the evidence you have on this and our response was well, its within your security agencies, you should be looking into how much they know you should be engaging.""""They [India] asked to show the evidence, and at that point, it was primmarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof,"" Trudeau said, underscoring the fragile basis of the initial accusations.The timing of Trudeau's confession coincides with an explosive claim by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a designated Khalistani terrorist and leader of the banned group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Pannun revealed that he had been in contact with Trudeau’s office for the past three years, regularly sharing information—further complicating the narrative of Canadian-Indian relations.This diplomatic row erupted when Canada labeled India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar’s death. India swiftly denounced the allegations, dismissing them as ""preposterous"" and part of Trudeau's political maneuvering.The fallout saw India recall its High Commissioner from Canada, followed by Ottawa expelling six Indian diplomats. In retaliation, New Delhi ordered six Canadian diplomats to leave before October 20, signaling a deepening divide between the two nations.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that his government had no concrete evidence when it initially accused India of being involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

J&K HC to set up special bench to hear plea against LG’s power to nominate 5 MLAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-hc-to-set-up-special-bench-to-hear-plea-against-lgs-power-to-nominate-5-mlas/articleshow/114327835.cms,"JAMMU: The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court will constitute a special bench to hear a PIL challenging the power vested in the lieutenant governor to nominate five members to the legislative assembly of the Union Territory.Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan agreed to constitute a special division bench on Monday after petitioner Ravinder Sharma , senior vice-president of J&K Pradesh Congress Committee and a former MLC, sought an urgent hearing.On Oct 14, a division bench of the Supreme Court had declined to hear a similar plea filed by Sharma, and had asked him to approach the high court first.The petition challenges the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act that empower the LG to nominate five MLAs to the 90-member assembly, taking its total strength to 95. The provisions had been inserted in the 2019 Act through an amendment in Dec 2023, triggering a massive uproar ahead of the recently held assembly elections, with opposition parties fearing it could alter the composition of the House. They alleged that the provisions were brought in to tilt the numbers in favour of BJP-NDA , in case of a close or hung verdict.With the National Conference-Congress alliance getting a clear mandate, NC vice-president Omar Abdullah on Oct 9 urged the Centre and LG Manoj Sinha not to unnecessarily create a political conflict by making the nominations.“Nominating these five will not change the govt. So, what is the use of it? You will unnecessarily nominate five people to sit in the opposition,” said Omar, who took oath as chief minister on Wednesday.Earlier, PDP leader Iltija Mufti had alleged a day before the counting of votes on Oct 8 that empowering the LG to nominate five members was a “brazen pre-result rigging”.BJP’s J&K chief Ravinder Raina had, on the other hand, defended the provision, saying the power had been given to the LG through an Act of Parliament, and that the nomination of MLAs would be “in accordance with the constitutional process”.","The petition challenges the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act that empower the LG to nominate five MLAs to the 90-member assembly.

Sabotage led to Bagmati Express crash: Probe report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sabotage-led-to-bagmati-express-crash-probe-report/articleshow/114326659.cms,"CHENNAI: An official inquiry into the Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express accident has indicated sabotage , confirming that nuts and bolts were removed from the track, causing the train to veer off the main track on to the loop line and ram into a stationary goods train at Kavaraipettai railway station on Oct 11. Twelve coaches were derailed and 20 people injured in the accident.On Thursday, 15 railway personnel, including the trackman, loco pilot of the train and Kavaraipettai station master appeared before the Commissioner for Rail Safety A M Chowdhary.They ruled out technical fault and confirmed that the nuts and bolts on the track were unfastened. However, the report was kept confidential.GRP assistant commissioner Karnan told TOI that the trackman had confirmed that six bolts and nuts were removed. Karnan told the police that it would take at least 30 minutes for an experienced person to do this; with a hand-held power gadget, it would take 15 to 20 minutes. ""The trackman was on duty from 7am to 5 pm on Oct 11, and he found no suspicious activity on the tracks during that time. After that, there was no other person assigned to check the tracks,"" he added.The sabotage is believed to have been carried out just before an EMU train passed through at 8.26pm. With the nuts and bolts removed, the track loosened further with the passage of the EMU train. As a result, the Bagmati Express, which arrived 12 minutes later, moved to the loop line - a track that branches out from the main route and merges with it again after a short distance.""The loco pilot of Bagmati Express confirmed that he saw the green signal. However, he was clueless about how the train moved to the loop line. Kavaraipettai station master Muni Prasad Babu also said he signalled green for the express train to pass through the main line,"" said an investigating officer.GRP officers said that a similar sabotage attempt was foiled at Ponneri Railway station on July 17 by a trackman during routine inspection.","An official inquiry into the Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express accident has indicated sabotage. 15 railway personnel, including the trackman, loco pilot of the train and Kavaraipettai station master appeared before the Commissioner for Rail Safety A M Chowdhary.

It has established that the Assam agitation was undertaken for genuine reasons, and all provisions stand legally validated.”Senior Gauhati HC advocate Bijan Kumar Mahajan said people, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, ought to now acknowledge the sanctity of Section 6A. “Since our student days, we have faced the dilemma of whether 1951 or 1971 is the base year for determining citizenship. The wait is over. It is the beauty of the Indian judiciary that a Constitution bench of the apex court has upheld Section 6A by a 4:1 majority.” Abhijeet Sarma of Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the case that led SC to order an enumeration exercise to update the NRC in the state, described the validation of Section 6A as “a historic resolution of the controversy”.He flagged doubts about the authenticity of the data in the updated NRC and the delay in ordering its verification as a hurdle to implementing the Assam Accord despite SC’s order. “What about the future of the Assamese people? Even today, the answer to this question is an authentic NRC. SC’s verdict, in fact, highlights NRC’s relevance.” Retired IAS officer Hitesh Dev Sarma, the former NRC coordinator in Assam, was among those who struck a discordant note about SC upholding Section 6A as constitutionally valid. In a social media post, he termed the judgment “a disheartening development” and “a terrible day for Assam”.He said the BJP-led state govt not moving SC for a comprehensive review of the NRC may have already paved the way for citizenship to foreigners whose names were included in the updated citizenship rolls based on allegedly faulty credentials. “Chances are the current NRC with lakhs of foreigners’ names will now be declared the final document.”The core of Section 6A is that immigrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, will enjoy all rights as citizens, while those who came to the state between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, will be subject to checks and compliance with case-specific requirements.",All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) celebrated what it termed a “historic’ second victory in the fight to save the state’s identity and demography.

Sec 6A suffers from vice of manifest arbitrariness: Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sec-6a-suffers-from-vice-of-manifest-arbitrariness-judge/articleshow/114330760.cms,"NEW DELHI: In ploughing a lone furrow to invalidate Section 6A of the Citizenship Act prospectively, Justice J B Pardiwala in his dissent fundamentally differed with the opinion of the four judges of the Supreme Court who upheld the validity of the provision, which was enacted in 1985 to curb illegal migration from Bangladesh after March 24, 1971.Though CJI D Y Chandrachud in a separate opinion agreed with Justice Surya Kant, who wrote the majority opinion on behalf of himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, to validate Section 6A, Justice Pardiwala focused only on Justice Kant’s opinion and mentioned his name 36 times in his 127-page opinion, which was conspicuous in its absence of any reference to the CJI.Justice Pardiwala did not fault the enactment of Section 6A in 1985 following the Assam Accord but said the provision has “acquired unconstitutionality with the efflux of time”.“The efflux of time has brought to light the element of manifest arbitrariness in the scheme of Section 6A(3) which fails to provide a temporal limit to its applicability. The prescribed mechanism also shifts the burden of detection of a foreigner solely on the state, thus, counter-serving the very purpose for which the provision was enacted, that is, the expedient detection of immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream, their deletion from the electoral rolls, and conferment of de-jure citizenship only upon the expiry of 10 years,” he said.“I am of the clear view that Section 6A suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness on account of the ‘systematic failure of the legislative vision’, if I may put it in the very words of Justice Kant,” he said, adding that continuance of Section 6A had resulted in the influx and continued presence of illegal immigrants into Assam till date.“Inadequate implementation of Section 6A(3) of the Act is inextricably linked to the fallacious mechanism (for detection and deportation of illegal migrants) that has been prescribed under it,” he added.Justice Pardiwala was, however, one with his peers and predecessors who wrote the Sonowal verdict in underlining the failure to stem the flood of illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Criticising successive govts since 1985 for doing precious little to detect and deport illegal migrants, Justice Pardiwala said, “In my view, although the mandate of timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants was the fundamental premise on which the Assam Accord was signed, yet, this intention recorded in the Accord was never translated statutorily, due to a faulty mechanism prescribed under Section 6A(3), either due to inadvertence or advertence of the legislature.”",Justice Pardiwala focused only on Justice Kant’s opinion and mentioned his name 36 times in his 127-page opinion.

Accordingly, Section 6A has become redundant qua those immigrants who have entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971,"" Justices Kant, Sundresh and Misra said.The majority held that the directions issued for identification, detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam after Mar 25, 1971, must be implemented expeditiously. Importantly, it said five laws - Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950; Foreigners Act, 1946; Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; and Passport Act, 1967 - must act in tandem to give effect to the legislative objective of Section 6A, that is not to permit any illegal Bangladeshi migrant to enter Assam after March 25, 1971.Finding that the SC's directives in the Sonowal judgment had not been implemented properly even after 20 years as only 97,714 cases were pending before Foreigners Tribunals even though millions of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have entered the state, the SC decided to monitor progress of detection and deportation of such migrants from now.""Implementation of immigration and citizenship legislations cannot be left to the mere wish and discretion of the authorities, necessitating constant monitoring by this court,"" Kant said.In his 94-page opinion, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The legislative objective of Section 6A was to balance the humanitarian needs of migrants of Indian origin and the impact of the migration on the economic and cultural needs of Indian states. The two yardsticks employed in Section 6A, that is migration to Assam and the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, are reasonable.""","Under Section 6A, Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, would be deemed Indian citizens.

Far from it, as the case of White Medical College in Punjab's Pathankot district shows. Two batches admitted in 2021 and 2022 have just been transferred out following an order of Punjab and Haryana high court that was unsuccessfully challenged in Supreme Court.The HC order castigated National Medical Commission (NMC) for allowing the college to admit students when the ""college has been a consistent defaulter"". Five inspections done by three different authorities - the university, NMC and directorate of medical education - in one and a half years found the college ""highly deficient for training MBBS students"". Deficiency in faculty and resident doctors was up to 90% and there was hardly any patient load, they found.The hospital now has the dubious distinction of five batches being transferred out before they completed the course. Despite its previous record of batches admitted in 2011, 2014 and 2016 being transferred out, NMC granted permission to admit 108 students in 2021 and 150 in 2022, on the basis of the college's undertaking that it has requisite infrastructure and faculty.""The annual declaration of the medical college, which is still available on NMC website, is full of falsehoods. How can a public authority host such unverified information on its website just on the basis of the undertaking of the very people who have been consistent defaulters?"" asked parents of some students in the college who have been complaining to NMC since Dec 2022 about the lack of facilities and teaching. A rough calculation shows the college has collected over Rs 30 crore from just the latest two batches that have been shifted out.""This case shows NMC's aadhaar based biometric attendance system, digital inspections and monitoring through CCTVs are a total failure. It is its job as the regulatory authority to do regular physical verification through surprise inspections and they ought to make the inspection reports public as the erstwhile MCI used to do. ,"" said the parent of a student.The court stated ""time has come for NMC to thoroughly re-look and introspect the manner in which the limited permissions or provisional recognition and affiliations are being granted"". It added that a huge responsibility lies on the members of such expert bodies to ensure that medical colleges are not run like commercial establishments.","White Medical College in Punjab's Pathankot district found ""highly deficient for training MBBS students"" Two batches admitted in 2021 and 2022 have just been transferred out following an order of Punjab and Haryana high court that was unsuccessfully challenged in Supreme Court. Five inspections done by three different authorities - the university, NMC and directorate of medical education - in one and a half years found deficiency in faculty and resident doctors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114329749,imgsize-631009,width-400,resizemode-4/114329749.jpg"

Scheme for gig workers’ social security by January,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scheme-for-gig-workers-social-security-by-january/articleshow/114328609.cms,"NEW DELHI: The labour ministry will soon put in place a framework for social security of gig workers , including health insurance and pension, a move that will benefit drivers with ride-hailing apps and those working with delivery platforms. The decision to roll out the framework in place is seen as a “soft launch” of the provisions in the labour codes, which is yet to be implemented as several states are still not on board.“We cannot deprive them of their rights till the implementation of the Code.We have to bring a policy before that,” labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Thursday. The labour code had for the first time defined gig workers. He also announced extension of the enhanced insurance benefits for all six crore EPFO members that will provide them up to Rs 7 lakh life cover.The scheme, which had expired, has been extended with retrospective effect from April 28. After a meeting with representatives of Platform Workers ’ Association earlier on Thursday, the minister said he will seek to put in place the social security framework before the budget in Feb and added that the policy will be legally binding across the country. Some of the states have enacted laws for gig workers.Mandaviya said that several suggestions such as creation of unique identity numbers for providing benefits and a cess on transactions to create a social security corpus have been made, which will be studied. The minister said that the ministry is exploring all suggestions as there is no employer and employee relationship in their case, and the main issue is who would pay for employers’ contribution to social security schemes for them.Niti Aayog has estimated 65 lakh gig and platform workers in the country, but the number is likely to be over two crore as the segment is growing rapidly. The Code on Social Security 2020 provides for social security measures for gig workers and platform workers on issues related to life and disability cover, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits and old age protection. It also provides for setting up a Social Security Fund to finance the welfare scheme.",The move will benefit drivers with ride-hailing apps and those working with delivery platforms.

NEW DELHI: United States on Thursday charged a second Indian, former intelligence officer Vikash Yadav , in an alleged plot to kill terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds US and Canadian citizenship.The US justice department announced that while Yadav is not in custody currently, the 39-year old faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.Yadav worked for Cabinet Secretariat, which includes the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), the country's foreign intelligence service.Sikh separatist Pannun is linked with Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group advocating for the secession of Punjab from India. The justice department said Yadav directed the plot and hired Gupta to find a hitman.Earlier, Nikhil Gupta, 53, pleaded not guilty after being extradited from the Czech Republic in June. The justice department claimed that Gupta contacted someone he believed was a criminal associate, who turned out to be a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated, ""Yadav, an employee of the Indian government, used his position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil.""The justice department press release said that in June 2023, Yadav provided Gupta with personal information about Pannun, including his address in New York City, phone numbers and details on day-to-day activities, which Gupta then passed to an undercover officer of DEA. ""Yadav directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot , which Gupta accomplished by forwarding to Yadav, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim. Gupta directed the undercover to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the undercover not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official state visit to the United States on June 20, 2023,"" said US.This comes amid souring of diplomatic relations between India and Canada over terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was murdered outside a Gurudwara in British Columbia.US further claims that a day after Nijjar murder, Gupta told the undercover officer that Nijjar 'was also the target' and 'we have so many targets.' ""Gupta added that, in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was 'now no need to wait' on killing Pannun. Yadav then sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged Gupta, “[i]t’s [a] priority now.”Attorney general Merrick Garland added, “As alleged, last year, we foiled an attempt by Vikash Yadav, an Indian government employee, and his co-conspirator, Nikhil Gupta, to assassinate an American citizen on US soil. Today’s charges demonstrate that the justice department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled.”The United States reported on Wednesday that India had informed them that the accused intelligence operative was no longer in government service. State department spokesman Matthew Miller said, ""They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government. We are satisfied with the cooperation.""","Vikash Yadav, 39, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering.
