Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours.

Having worked in Dubai, Hong Kong and Muscat (where she was employed by a 'sheikh') as a domestic worker, she reels off the dos and don'ts. ""Do not give your phone to your employer. Remember, they need you more than you need them. Ensure that you are allowed to speak to your family every day.Clients will say they have spent lakhs on your visa, so they have a right to take away your passport but don't fall for that. Don't go for a lower salary, and don't fall for scammy agents,"" says the 35-year-old, who has drawn a salary of up to Rs 45,000 a month abroad and wants to go to London for her next job.Not everyone is as savvy. While the money is more than what they would get in India for a similar job, it's still nothing compared to what a local would be paid. Before that comes the hurdle of getting there. Many of them take loans to pay greedy agents who don't give them the proper paperwork. Without that, they are held hostage by employers who take their passports and withhold salaries. As the recent Hinduja case in which four members of the family were convicted for exploiting domestic staff at their luxury villa in Geneva showed, even wealthy NRI tycoons can behave that way and not just a sheikh in the Gulf. Besides other charges like confiscation of passports, low salaries and long hours, the lead prosecutor pointed out that the family's annual spend on their pet dog surpassed the salary they offered their house-help.In the Hinduja case, the domestic workers took a rare step and fought back against exploitation, but the case highlights a larger problem - that of India's lack of protective mechanisms for domestic workers at home and abroad. India has not ratified the ILO Domestic Workers Convention No 189, which requires signatory governments to protect the rights of domestic workers. ""India should negotiate stronger bilateral labour agreements with destination countries to ensure that domestic workers are granted legal protections, fair wages, and safe working conditions,"" says Karan S Thukral, a Delhi-based immigration lawyer. ""Implementing accessible and effective reporting mechanisms for workers who don't speak the local language to report abuse and exploitation is critical. These mechanisms should ensure confidentiality and protection against retaliation,"" he adds.Sister Josephine Amala Valarmathi, Tamil Nadu state coordinator at the non-profit National Domestic Workers' Movement, says people use loopholes to not formalise this labour. ""More often than not, domestic workers are taken abroad as 'relatives' to escape any formal work agreement or contracts.""That several 'nanny institutes' have sprouted across north India shows that there is a demand to cater to busy NRI couples who seek help with child and elderly care. These institutes teach aspirants, who must have studied till either class 10 or 12, the basics of nutrition, first aid, etiquette, child behavioural psychology, etc through six-month certificate courses. Sometimes they are even required to take IELTS exams as part of the course, after which they travel on special caregiver visas.The day the Hindujas were convicted, the Kerala government became the first in the country to announce plans for a legislation for safeguarding house-helps, with the draft laying out minimum wage, fixed hours, workplace security, rest time, and outlining responsibilities of the employer and private placement agencies. Sonia George, vice-president of SEWA, a union of informal workers, and an executive committee member of International Domestic Workers' Federation, points out that while this is a welcome step, it isn't applicable overseas. ""The draft emigration Bill proposed by the external affairs ministry in 2019 and revised in 2021 would have addressed the concerns of overseas Indian domestic workers had it seen the light of day. Post-pandemic international migration of domestic workers acquired through illegal recruitment agencies has gone up in Kerala. These agencies tap into the most marginalised sections, including workers from tribal communities, Dalits and fisherfolk,"" says George, adding that the urgency to pay off debts accrued during the pandemic has only increased the need to go work abroad.","Anjali from Ulhasnagar in Thane has worked in Dubai, Hong Kong and Muscat.

NEET-UG paper leak case: Principal's arrest stuns Hazaribag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/principals-arrest-stuns-hazaribag/articleshow/111370581.cms,"HAZARIBAG: Arrest of principal of Hazaribag 's Oasis School , Ehsanul Haque , by CBI in NEET-UG paper leak case has left those who have known him since his days of struggle in shock and disbelief. Many of them find it hard to accept that the soft-spoken teacher, who built the reputation of Oasis as the city's premier school from scratch, could be involved in the paper leak.Haque, 42, once ran a coaching institute called 'Seed' on Pugmil Road in the city.In 2013, he was roped in to head the Oasis School, located on Mandai Road in Hazaribag district, at its inception by its owner and chairman, Shabbir Ahmad.He faced significant challenges, right from taking the school to new heights to securing a CBSE affiliation, but succeeded in both, making Oasis one of Hazaribag's most sought-after schools, thanks to its top-notch infrastructure and faculty.The school, which started with 100-odd students in 2013, now has over 4,000 students and over 40 teachers, and runs from a modern building with state-of-the-art facilities for academics and sports. The school got CBSE affiliations for classes X and XII in 2020.Sources said a total of 118 students appeared in class X board exams in 2012-2022, and the school had a 100% pass percentage, with 38 students securing marks above 85%. In 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, too, all students who appeared for class X and XII board examinations passed.The academic success of the school also established Haque, who holds PhD and BEd degrees, among the noted academicians in Hazaribag. After being appointed as CBSE coordinator, he became a prominent figure of the city and was often invited to various programmes organised by different schools, said one of his acquaintances. Haque, his friends revealed, comes from a humble background. His father, a former employee of Central Coalfields Limited, passed away recently. A bachelor, he takes care of his two younger brothers and their families, and a married sister. ""He always remained busy from morning to evening, with most of his time spent at the school,"" one of his friends said.The staff at Oasis School and his neighbours in the Hasmia colony are still in shock over his arrest on Friday. None in the school or the locality wished to speak anything on record on Saturday.""It's beyond my expectation as to why he did what he did. It's a tough time for his family,"" said one of the locals, who did not wish to be identified. Another person said, ""When the almighty gave him everything, right from the chair of a big school to the CBSE coordinator, what was the use of indulging in wrong activities?""","Ehsanul Haque, 42, once ran a coaching institute called 'Seed' in the city.

in city, man electrocuted

NEW DELHI: The flooded underpasses in the capital have taken a heavy toll with four lives being lost in them between Friday and Saturday following the torrential rain which disrupted normal life. This has brought the toll in the city in the aftermath of the intense downpour to 11.A 60-year-old security guard 's body was removed from an underpass in Okhla in south Delhi while another body of a young man, about 20 years old, was taken out of the flooded Shalimar Bagh underpass in north-west Delhi on Friday.The latter is still to be identified. Meanwhile, two boys, aged around 12, drowned in another waterlogged underpass in Samaypur Badli, also in north-west Delhi, on Saturday.The reasons for the senseless deaths was in one case a desperate attempt to cross to the other side for work and in the rest going for a swim or bath. In either case, the authorities must be blamed for being negligent in not barring access to the underpasses early enough and not draining out the water fast enough.Though some parts of the city witnessed light rain on Saturday, IMD has sounded an orange alert for moderate to heavy rain Sunday and heavy rain Monday and Tuesday.At 6.23am on Friday, police received information about a man having drowned in the water at the Okhla underpass. ""A passerby spotted him in the water with a scooter found nearby,"" said a senior officer. A team from the local police station rushed to the scene and pulled the man out. They found an Aadhaar card in his pocket which identified him as Digvijay Kumar Chaudhary, a resident of Jaitpur Extension.He worked as a security guard at a private firm in Okhla Phase 2 and was probably on his way to work when the incident occurred. The man was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he was declared dead. Police have initiated legal proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC. The underpass is managed by DDA but a spokesperson denied any knowledge of the incident.In the incident at the Samaypur Badli underpass, bodies of the two boys were fished out at 4:15 pm on Saturday after the police responded to a call at 2:25 pm. ""Upon reaching the spot, we found that the underpass near the metro had approximately 2.5-3 feet of water,"" the officer said.One of the deceased was identified as a resident of Siraspur while the other remains unidentified. Proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC have been initiated.In other incidents, two boys had drowned in a ditch in northeast Delhi's New Usmanpur while a 40-year-old man was electrocuted in Prem Nagar, north-west Delhi, on Friday.Meanwhile, bodies of three labourers were finally recovered from a pit in Vasant Vihar on Saturday morning, more than 24 hours after they got buried in mud because of a mishap at a construction site.On Friday, a canopy at the forecourt of Terminal 1 at IGI Airport had collapsed, leaving a cabbie dead and eight injured.","A 60-year-old security guard's body was removed from an underpass in Okhla in south Delhi.

Over the past week, five bridges have collapsed in different districts, including Araria, Siwan, East Champaran, Kishanganj, and Madhubani.Manjhi, who also heads the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), expressed his concerns during a press briefing on Saturday.""It is a matter of concern that bridges are collapsing in Bihar. It looks as if poor-quality material might have been used. But why were the bridges not collapsing 15 days or a month ago? Why are they collapsing now? Is there a conspiracy behind it?"" he questioned.He suggested that these incidents might be deliberate actions aimed at tarnishing the government's reputation. ""These things are being done on purpose to tarnish the image of the government. Bridges are collapsing continuously, I think this is happening on purpose,"" he said as quoted ANI.However, Manjhi also acknowledged the issue of sub-standard construction materials being used by contractors, which could be contributing to the collapses. ""The state government is taking strict action against the contractors and engineers responsible for the collapsed bridges. The authorities are probing the matter and I also request them to investigate the conspiracy angle,"" he added.The former chief minister emphasized the need for thorough investigations and stringent measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

PANAJI: Goa police have said in a report to the state chief secretary that they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family in order to help Mumbai resident Pooja Sharma, a senior intelligence officer's wife, get the property vacated , reported.Besides instructing them to not take any action against Pooja, the report said the DGP threatened Anjuna police officers that if the ""demolition work"" was not allowed to continue they would have to ""face the consequences"".The report said when Anjuna police tried to stop the demolition, ""the DGP started shouting"" and said it should be demolished at any cost. He also instructed them that ""if any person is obstructing the demolition they should be brought to the police station"".In a chronology of events that transpired on June 22, the report said at 2.32pm, Anjuna police got a call from Panaji police control room that a person needs their help as “some persons are demolishing his house near Ganga tiles factory at Assagao”.Anjuna police sub-inspectors (PSIs) Sanket Pokhare and Nitin Naik rushed to the spot and found an excavator was demolishing the house — ground plus one floor. Pradeep Agarwadekar and his family, who were present on the spot, claimed that they were inside the house when they started demolishing.“Pokhare told the people to stop the demolition work, while asking the Agarwadekars to produce the documents of the house. He also directed the excavator operator to bring the vehicle to the police station,” the report said.While Anjuna police were carrying out their duty, they got a call from the DGP, “asking why the work of demolition of the house has been stopped”. When he was apprised about the situation, the report said, he got angry and said, “there was nobody inside the house when the demolition work was going as he has personally verified it”.The report said the DGP was pressurising Anjuna police to “take the occupants of the house to the police station and to allow the demolition work to continue”. Instead, Anjuna police instructed the Agarwadekars to come to the station and lodge a complaint.Pradeep Agarwadekar’s wife Prinsha along with her daughter came to the police station, while her husband and son stayed back at the site.The report said while they were at the police station, a person Arshad Khawaja came and told police that he was demolishing the house “as per the instructions from the top officer”. He told them that they would have received a phone call from the top officer.Khawaja also told them that he had received instructions to start the work again and said they could get in touch with him if they had any doubts. “Khawaja shared his mobile number.”The owner of the excavator, Ashley Rodrigues, also went to the police station and said Khawaja had told him that he has “contacts with top officials and that he (Khawaja) will manage all things on the spot”.The DGP called Anjuna police again and directed that “anyhow the work of demolition of the house must take place and no one should stop the work… to allow Arshad Khawaja to continue demolishing the house”.The Anjuna police report also said DGP Singh told them “Pooja Sharma is the owner of the property, and no cognisable offence is made out into the complaint of Prinsha Agarwadekar. Hence, there is no need to take action on her (Prinsha's) complaint”.","Goa police say they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Unveiling Kerala's Unique Duryodhan Temple: A Taxpaying Tribute to Mahabharat's Arch Villain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

Nawazuddin Siddiqui comes out in support of Ranveer Singh as Jim Sarbh and Prashant Narayanan undermine his acting process for ‘Padmaavat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/nawazuddin-siddiqui-comes-out-in-support-of-ranveer-singh-as-jim-sarbh-and-prashant-narayanan-undermine-his-acting-process-for-padmaavat/articleshow/111348437.cms,"Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh Spotted Hand-in-Hand at Mumbai Airport

We frequently hear stories of actors who become overly committed to a part and struggle to let go of it. Ranveer Singh is one of those actors who shared this story. He revealed that the character of Allaudin Khilji in the film ‘ Padmaavat ’ was so dark and complicated that he was frightened he would fall into a deep pit from which he could never come out.He had disclosed that, in order to get ready for the part, he would shut himself up in his Goregaon house, where he was completely empty.But recently, in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, actor Prashant Narayanan questioned Ranveer's methodology. He said, “Woh jhoot bol raha hai. Yeh dark spaces mein jana, yeh sab karna yeh bakwas ki baatein hai.”Now, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer. He yelled aggressively, ""It's about Narayanan's remarks from a conversation with Shubankar Mishra.""Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has been in the profession for years and is considered one of the finest actors of his generation, has spoken up in Ranveer’s support. When he was questioned about Narayanan’s recent remarks in a conversation with Shubankar Mishra, he angrily said, “The people who are calling it fake, did they bother to understand the actor’s process? Did they bother to understand how he was living his life when he was creating the character? They are simply judging him. We don’t know what a man is thinking when he’s coming up with a characterisation.”He further added, “They think it is pretentious. When you dive deep into a character, it is a very painful process. This is a very irresponsible thing to say. If there was no process, then what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight would not be possible… That man was extremely serious about his performance and that is why he excelled in the character; that’s how iconic characters are born. If we are going to take (the process) casually, then you’ll end up with people just blurting out dialogues randomly. This is what makes separates a good actor from the rest. You never know which part of his past he is tapping to get into character. You can’t take this so easily.”The actor emphasised that in order to enter the characters' heads, actors enter difficult places. He angrily asked in what way people are able to dismiss all of this as pretentious and if they have ever attempted to portray a role similar to this. He even called out Jim Sarbh and Prashant Narayanan for their remarks and said, “What are they doing now? Do you see what Bobby Deol has been doing lately? And what is the man who commented doing currently?”He concluded by saying, “Who are we to say if Ranveer should or should not put himself through a painful process? What if he did? How do we know it? It is very easy to make such comments. We cannot underestimate anyone.. This is an actor’s job.”In a recent interview with The Quint, Jim Sarbh stated, “There are all those actors who are like ‘You know, I was so stuck in my character that I had to get mental therapy for weeks after.’ I was like ‘shut up bro. You didn’t even know your lines on the day, what nonsense.”On the work front, Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s new film ‘Rautu Ka Raaz’ was released on ZEE5 on June 28.","Nawazuddin Siddiqui has voiced his support for Ranveer Singh.

Calories Burned by Walking: How many calories are burned in walking 1 km?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/how-many-calories-are-burned-in-walking-1-km/articleshow/111300054.cms,"Factors influencing calorie burn



Heart diseases in women: Experts weighs in on latest worrying trends, signs and symptoms

Estimating calorie burn



How to enhance calorie burn



One effective way to burn more calories is by walking faster. A brisk pace increases your heart rate, leading to higher calorie expenditure.

Incorporate intervals of fast walking or jogging. Alternating between walking and jogging or sprinting can significantly increase the total calories burned.

Carrying light weights or wearing a weighted vest can add resistance, increasing the energy required and thus, burning more calories.

Opt for routes with hills or uneven terrain. Walking uphill or on trails provides a more strenuous workout than flat surfaces.

Simply walking longer distances will naturally increase the total calories burned. Gradually increasing your walking distance is a great way to boost your overall calorie expenditure.

Health benefits of walking beyond calorie burn



Walking is one of the simplest and most effective forms of exercise, offering numerous health benefits. From improving cardiovascular health to keeping the respiratory system on track, walking offers several benefits that can be reaped during a regular day.One frequently asked question is, ""How many calories are burned after walking 1 kilometer?"" The answer depends on several factors, including weight, walking speed , and terrain.The number of calories burned during walking significantly depends on the individual’s weight. Heavier individuals burn more calories because their bodies require more energy to move. For example, a person weighing 70 kg will burn fewer calories walking 1 km compared to someone weighing 90 kg.The pace at which you walk affects the calorie expenditure . Walking at a brisk pace (5-6 km/h) burns more calories compared to a leisurely stroll (3-4 km/h). Increasing your walking speed boosts your heart rate and energy expenditure, leading to higher calorie burn.Walking on different types of terrain or inclines also impacts the number of calories burned. Walking uphill or on uneven terrain requires more effort than walking on flat, smooth surfaces. Thus, walking on hilly or rugged paths increases calorie consumption.Metabolism tends to slow with age, so younger people might burn calories more efficiently than older individuals. Additionally, men generally have a higher muscle mass compared to women, resulting in slightly higher calorie burn.Individuals with higher fitness levels tend to burn fewer calories performing the same activity as their bodies become more efficient at utilizing energy. Conversely, those who are less fit may burn more calories as their bodies work harder.To provide a general estimate, let’s consider a few scenarios based on body weight:A person weighing 55 kg walking at a moderate pace (5 km/h) burns approximately 50-60 calories per kilometer. The exact number can vary based on speed and terrain, but this provides a baseline figure.For someone weighing 70 kg, the calorie burn is roughly 60-75 calories per kilometer. This estimate assumes a moderate walking pace on flat terrain. The calorie burn increases with faster walking speeds or uphill walks.A person weighing 90 kg may burn about 80-100 calories walking 1 kilometer. This higher calorie expenditure is due to the increased energy required to move a heavier body.Walking 1 kilometer may burn a modest number of calories, but the health benefits extend far beyond weight management. Regular walking can improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, enhance mood, and boost overall well-being. It’s a low-impact exercise suitable for all ages and fitness levels, making it an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.Common walking mistakes to avoid include overstriding, where steps are too long, leading to inefficient movement and potential injury. Walking with poor posture, such as slouching or leaning too far forward or backward, can strain muscles and joints. Another mistake is walking with tense shoulders or clenched fists, which increases tension and discomfort. Neglecting proper footwear and walking on hard surfaces without cushioning can impact joints over time. Finally, not warming up or cooling down properly before and after walking can increase the risk of injury. Correcting these mistakes promotes safer, more enjoyable walking experiences while minimizing strain on the body.Certain individuals should avoid walking if they have medical conditions or physical limitations that could be exacerbated by physical activity. This includes people with severe arthritis, recent bone fractures, acute injuries, or conditions affecting balance and coordination. Individuals with cardiovascular issues like unstable angina or severe heart failure should consult their healthcare provider before engaging in strenuous activities such as prolonged walking. Pregnant women with complications like preterm labor or placental disorders should also be cautious. Always seek medical advice if unsure about your ability to walk safely based on your health status.","The number of calories burned during walking significantly depends on the individual’s weight.
