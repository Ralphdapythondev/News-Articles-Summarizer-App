This will be only the fourth time - and the first in nearly 50 years - when a speaker will not be elected by consensus.

Birla will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row.

The post was contested in 1952, the first Lok Sabha , in 1967 and 1976.

NEW DELHI: Failing to reach a consensus over the Speaker candidate for the 18th Lok Sabha , the opposition INDIA bloc has fielded K Suresh against BJP-led NDA 's pick Om Birla , who is in contest for the second stint.Birla, MP from Rajasthan's Kota, was renominated by the NDA for the Speaker post on Tuesday.Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday roped in INDIA bloc leaders to build a consensus on the Speaker name but failed to break the ice as the opposition wanted to name their candidate for the deputy speaker post in return for their support to NDA's Speaker pick.After hectic parleys and long discussions, the INDIA bloc decided to field K Suresh an, eight-time Congress MP from Kerala.While the opposition has put all its weight into ensuring the Speaker election is not a cakewalk for the NDA, the Speaker election has become one of a kind as it will be held after 48 years.","Om Birla will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row.

'Restrict non-essential movement': Indian embassy issues advisory after violence erupts in Kenya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/restrict-non-essential-movement-indian-embassy-issues-advisory-after-violence-erupts-in-kenya/articleshow/111270750.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian embassy in Kenya issued an advisory on X (formerly Twitter), cautioning Indian citizens residing in the country amidst the ongoing unrest. The post stated, ""In view of the prevailing tense situation, all Indians in Kenya are advised to exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up. Please follow local news and Mission's website and social media handles for updates.""The advisory comes in the wake of violent confrontations between protesters and police forces in various cities across Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. The clashes erupted following the Kenyan parliament's approval of a contentious finance bill that introduces tax increases , further exacerbating the nation's already dire cost-of-living crisis.According to eyewitness accounts, security forces resorted to using tear gas, water cannons, and firing shots above the heads of protesters in an attempt to disperse the crowds. In response, demonstrators hurled stones at the police. As the parliamentary debate on the tax bill unfolded, riot police formed a perimeter around the parliament building and the State House, which serves as the president's office and residence. The bill was ultimately passed, and the parliament subsequently adjourned, even as protesters assembled outside the building.The demonstrations reflect the growing discontent among Kenyans, who are not only opposed to the tax hikes but also demanding the resignation of President William Ruto. The country is currently grappling with a severe economic crisis , and the new tax measures have further fueled public anger and frustration.","The advisory comes in the wake of violent confrontations between protesters and police forces in various cities across Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi.

"In his first constitutional post, Rahul to be Lok Sabha leader of opposition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-his-first-constitutional-post-rahul-to-be-lok-sabha-leader-of-opposition/articleshow/111268028.cms,"Honour wishes of CWC on LOP post, Kharge urges Rahul

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi will be leader of opposition in Lok Sabha , in a major leg up for the Gandhi scion in his parliamentary responsibilities which is widely viewed as laying the ground for an aggressive and confrontational face-off with a dominant BJP.The expectation that politics in coming days will be a ' Modi vs Rahul' duel got another fillip by the fact that as LoP - the first constitutional position he will hold - Rahul is likely to be chairman of the all-important Public Accounts Committee that has the primary function of examining CAG reports, and can also seek probes from the govt. The panel, though with govt majority which decides issues by vote, has proved to be testy for many regimes. Besides, he would also be a member of various collegiums comprising the PM and CJI or govt nominees for selection of chiefs of important investigation and transparency agencies - CBI, Lokpal, CVC, CEC/Election Commissioners and CIC.In a late evening announcement, AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi has written to pro tem speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab appointing Rahul as LoP. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said Rahul would become the ""voice of the last person standing"". AICC treasurer Ajay Maken said, ""Rahul has always been the most fearless voice among the opposition, and as LoP, his impact will be even more profound"".The decision to name Rahul Gandhi as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha lifted the suspense on the issue that has been agitating minds in Congress since results of the 2024 elections were declared, and especially after Congress Working Committee on June 9 passed a resolution urging Rahul to take up the position.In the meeting, Kharge had personally pushed the issue by telling Rahul that he was anyway playing the key role of mediation and coordination, and had gained the desired experience to take up the formal post. Besides, he had urged Rahul to honour the wishes of the party's apex body.The appointment comes in the wake of Congress being in high spirits despite losing the third consecutive election to the Modi-led BJP, encouraged by the fact that it has revived in key regions of the country and performed admirably despite the adverse circumstances of extreme polarisation, funds crunch, pressure from agencies and sidelining in media under the BJP dispensation. Besides, the strong showing and unity of the INDIA bloc has raised the prospect of a spirited fightback in the future.As the head of a rejuvenated opposition led by a strong Congress strength, the party believes Rahul can take on Modi with a focused targeting of govt on issues of governance. The Congress leader is credited with taking on BJP at a time when regional parties were cagey about its blowback. He also put ""communalism"" back on centre stage in the face of popular belief that it would repel Hindu voters - as headlined by his two countrywide yatras.Rahul himself said at a press conference last week, when he remarked, ""Earlier, only Congress was not scared of Modi, now other parties are also not scared of him.""","Rahul Gandhi will be leader of opposition in Lok Sabha. He is likely to be chairman of the all-important Public Accounts Committee.

"NDA sticks with Birla, Congress picks Suresh for 4th-ever Speaker contest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-sticks-with-birla-congress-picks-suresh-for-4th-ever-speaker-contest/articleshow/111268019.cms,"We want speakers to be elected via consensus:

Rijiju

NEW DELHI: In the first trial of strength for the newly-elected Modi govt, opposition on Tuesday decided to field its candidate K Suresh against NDA 's nominee Om Birla for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker .The contest, which had looked likely, became inevitable after govt turned down the opposition's demand for the post of deputy speaker as a pre-condition for facilitating a consensus on a fresh term for Birla, the outgoing speaker. Govt refused to accept the opposition's demand, saying the issue of deputy speaker could be negotiated later.Though this will be only the fourth time - and the first in nearly 50 years - when a speaker will not be elected by consensus, the contest on Wednesday is only in line with the intense acrimony that marked the LS campaign and has since persisted. The post was contested in 1952, the first Lok Sabha, in 1967 and 1976.With NDA having an official strength of 293 in the 543-strong House, the stage is set for Birla, third-term MP from Kota, to get a second term as speaker. He will be the fifth person after M A Ayyangar, G S Dhillon, Balram Jakhar and GMC Balayogi to hold the office two times in a row. Only Jakhar completed two full terms.Congress's Suresh is a veteran of eight terms from Kerala but his choice has equally, if not more, to do with him being a Dalit. Congress and some allies are seeking to build on the advantage they are perceived to have gained among Dalits on the strength of their allegation that BJP under Modi planned to scrap caste quotas.Defence minister Rajnath Singh held several rounds of discussions with opposition leaders, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, for a consensus over the speaker’s choice. However, the opposition insisted on a commitment for the deputy speaker’s post going to one of their own. Govt, which had looked uncomfortable with the idea, did not agree to the condition saying the issue should be left for later.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said as per convention, the deputy speaker’s post was spared for the opposition, a claim refuted by NDA, which cited multiple instances under Congress regimes of both positions being held by nominees of the treasury benches.“For the last two days, we have been in contact with main opposition parties, talked to their floor leaders regarding the post of speaker. We want speakers to be elected unopposed and through consensus. We appealed to them to support the speaker candidate but they demanded the deputy speaker’s post. We said it is not right to conduct elections for speaker and deputy speaker posts together. We request them for no election for speaker,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said.Though only the second fiddle as deputy speaker gets to preside over House proceedings in the absence of the speaker, the holder of the post can strike a discordant note for the govt in a fractious Parliament.BJP has the entire NDA flock sticking together. In contrast, TMC made public its annoyance with Congress over what it called the unilateral declaration of Suresh’s candidature.JD(U) leader and Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ said Birla’s name was decided unanimously by all NDA parties. After the decision, Birla called on PM Modi, who was present in Parliament. Later, home minister Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, BJP president J P Nadda and NDA leaders handed over Birla’s nomination papers to Lok Sabha secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh.If the opposition insists on a division during the election on Wednesday, votes will be cast on paper slips as the electronic display system cannot be used because members of the new House are yet to be allotted seats.","Om Birla, third-term MP from Kota, to get a second term as speaker.

"From Ram to Hindu Rashtra to Palestine, slogans create storm in teacup",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-ram-to-hindu-rashtra-to-palestine-slogans-create-storm-in-teacup/articleshow/111267776.cms,"NEW DELHI: It was the day of religious invocations and storms in the teacup on the second day of MPs oath-taking in the Lok Sabha. The repeated chants of Jai Shri Ram from BJP triggered much mirth as Samajwadi Party's showcasing of its MP representing Ayodhya (Faizabad constituency), a sore defeat for BJP, checked the enthusiasm in the governing camp. Even as it dominated the proceedings through the day, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi's hailing of Palestine after the oath triggered belated protests from BJP, leading to a minor disturbance. BJP's Chhatrapal Gangwar from Bareilly said ""Jai Hindu Rashtra "", which stoked protests from the opposition bench that called it ""against the Constitution"".The oath by Owaisi, who also used an Islamic war cry, was over and he was firmly ensconced in his seat with the proceedings smoothly under way, before Shobha Karandlaje questioned the invocation of Palestine by the Hyderabad veteran, in what was an afterthought. She was joined by NDA colleague Shrikant Shinde and C M Ramesh which led to some commotion. Sitting in his place, Owaisi stood his ground. But the Chair, Radha Mohan Singh, clarified only the oath was going on record, urging members to not create any disturbance. Earlier, pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab had said chants and invocations should be avoided, but it was ignored by the members throughout.Interestingly, when Owaisi's name was called out and he was proceeding to the podium, BJP benches raised 'Jai Shri Ram'and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' slogans , as if to tease him. Later, when Arun Govil of BJP raised 'Jai Shri Ram', SP's Dharmendra Yadav asked why BJP was not objecting to it, and he was joined by others. Then, Dharmendra loudly shouted 'Jai Awadhesh' and the Faizabad MP, as if on cue, stood up with raised folded hands in mock acknowledgement of the assembly - a grandstanding that triggered laughter all around.The to and fro continued. The icing on the opposition's cake was when Awadhesh Prasad's name was called. This time, the opposition benches broke into 'Jai Shri Ram', and the BJP side was mum. While INDIA bloc handed BJP a solid defeat in Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, it is the upstaging of the saffron party in Faizabad constituency that the opposition has been using to rub it in. It proved effective in Parliament for the first two days.The plea for help for troubled regions attracted attention too. The oaths of Alfred ken-Ngam Arthur and Bimol Akoijam, MPs from Manipur, which has been roiled by ethnic conflict for over a year, led to lusty cheers of ""Manipur, Manipur"" from Congress and the opposition, with the members themselves seeking ""justice for Manipur"". Meanwhile, Owaisi hailed Palestine.","All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi's hailing of Palestine after the oath triggered belated protests from BJP.

During Indira Gandhi's tenure as PM, R K Khadilkar from Congress was deputy speaker from 1967-1969, Poonawala said.He also shared details of states governed by Congress and its allies where both the posts were held by the same party. In West Bengal, TMC's Biman Banerjee is the speaker and his party colleague Ashish Banerjee is the deputy speaker.

Researchers say this finding is crucial in finding out why megafauna (animals weighing more than 40kg) went extinct in India.The discovery of nearly 3,500 pieces of ostrich eggshells from a patch of 1x1.5 metres is not only the first evidence of the presence of ostrich in south India, it is also the first time that archaeological evidence of a 41,000-year-old ostrich nest has been established.Megafauna, literally large animals, refers to animals like horses, elephants, cattle, and hippopotamus. Some of these megafauna became extinct around 40,000 years ago from different parts of the world. ""The oldest ostrich eggshell were discovered from the Siwalik Hills on the Indian side of the Himalayas. They date back more than 20 lakh years. Even in peninsular India, the oldest evidence of ostrich eggshells was discovered from Katoti in Rajasthan, which date back to 60,000 years,"" said Devara Anilkumar, assistant professor at the department of archaeology and ancient history at MSU.

Article 93

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly 50 years, elections for the Lok Sabha Speaker will see a spirited contest as the ruling BJP-led NDA alliance has been unable to strike a consensus with the now much stronger Congress-led opposition bloc INDIA.While the NDA has fielded former Speaker Om Birla , INDIA has picked Congress leader and senior-most Lok Sabha MP Kodikunnil Suresh.The Speaker for the 18th Lok Sabha will be elected on June 26. On June 27, President Droupadi Murmu is scheduled to address a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.This is only the third time that elections will be held for the Lok Sabha Speaker post.As per the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the first such contest was in 1952 between GV Mavalankar and Shankar Shantaram. Mavalankar won with 394 votes whereas Shantaram got 55.The second such fight happened in 1976 between Baliram Bhagat and Jagannath Rao. Bhagat won with 344 votes while Jagannath Rao got 58.The latest contest is likely to see a much narrower victory margin.In the just concluded 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA secured 293 seats -- well above the halfway mark of 272 -- while INDIA bagged 234 seats. A total of 16 seats were won by Independents or other regional parties.Before Suresh filed his nomination for the post, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said that INDIA bloc was ready to extend support to NDA's Speaker candidate, but the post of Deputy Speaker should be given to the opposition.""Rajnath Singh said that he would call Mallikarjun Kharge but he has not done that yet ... PM Modi is asking for cooperation from Opposition but our leader is getting insulted,"" said Rahul Gandhi, shortly after which K Suresh --an 8-time MP -- filed his nomination for the Speaker seat.NDA candidate Birla was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the previous 17th Lok Sabha.Birla's name was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was supported by all major opposition parties, including Congress, TMC, DMK, and BJD. The YSRCP and TDP also supported Birla's candidature.Article 93 of Constitution that deals with the Speaker and deputy Speaker of the House of the People, states: ""The House of the People shall, as soon as may be, choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker thereof and, so often as the office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker becomes vacant, the House shall choose another member to be Speaker or Deputy Speaker, as the case may be.""","For the first time in nearly 50 years, elections for the Lok Sabha Speaker will see a spirited contest.

"Can’t call a man ‘enemy’ for working in Pakistan, says HC, junks property case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cant-call-a-man-enemy-for-working-in-pakistan-says-hc-junks-property-case/articleshow/111267561.cms,"KOCHI: A high court bench of Justice Viju Abraham has ruled that merely because a man went to Pakistan in search of a job and worked there briefly does not classify him as an ' enemy ' under the Defence of India Rules .The court was considering a petition by Ummar Koya of Malappuram seeking a declaration that his father's property could not be subjected to the provisions of the Enemy Property Act of 1968. Koya, a senior citizen retired from the Kerala Police Service, stated that his father Kunji Koya went to Karachi, Pakistan in 1953 in search of employment and worked as a helper in a hotel there for a short period. Later, he returned to India and passed away at the age of 93 in Parappanangadi, Malappuram in 1995.When the petitioner approached the village officer (VO) to pay the property tax for 2022-23, it was declined. The VO informed him that the tehsildar had instructed him not to collect the tax on the property based on the guidance of the Custodian of Enemy Property of India (CEPI). Additionally, it was revealed that the CEPI had initiated a national investigation into several properties, including 60 immovable properties in Kerala. The petitioner's father was suspected to be an enemy (a Pakistani national) under Section 2(b) of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, and consequently, the portion of the property inherited by the petitioner was also suspected to be an 'enemy property'.Ummar Koya argued that due to continuous harassment by police authorities who branded his father as a Pakistani citizen, he had approached the central govt to determine his national status as an Indian citizen. It was confirmed that his father had not voluntarily acquired Pakistani citizenship and thus remained an Indian citizen.Despite the central gov's contention that the petitioner's father could be classified as an 'enemy' under the Defence of India Act because he resided in Pakistan, the bench ruled that he did not fall under this definition in both the Defence of India Acts of 1962 and 1971. Kunji Koya was an Indian citizen, and the bench emphasized that the CEPI had no evidence to support allegations of trading with an 'enemy' or involvement in any business with an 'enemy firm'. Consequently, the bench quashed the CEPI proceedings and directed revenue officials to collect property tax from the petitioner.","Ummar Koya, a senior citizen retired from the Kerala Police Service, stated that his father Kunji Koya went to Karachi, Pakistan in 1953 in search of employment and worked as a helper in a hotel there for a short period.

A total 33 of the existing 35 district presidents and 96 of the existing 105 constituency in-charges lauded Badal's leadership.Badal said at a meeting at the party's headquarters in Chandigarh: ""I cannot allow SAD to become a puppet of anti-Panth designs. Those ready to betray Panth, Punjab, farmers and the deprived sections of the people are free to follow their course.""A significant section of SAD's core vote base - the Sikhs - have turned against the party since the Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan police firing in 2015 during the SAD-BJP regime. The slide has continued in successive elections and bypolls since 2017: in the recent Lok Sabha polls, SAD won just one of the 13 seats in Punjab.After a five-hour meeting in Jalandhar, the faction opposed to Badal announced the launch of 'SAD Bachao Lehar (Save SAD Movement)' from the Akal Takht on July 1. During this campaign, SAD will contact sympathisers of the Panth, intellectuals, and others to seek their suggestions to ""save the party"".Addressing mediapersons after the meeting, senior SAD member Prem Singh Chandumajra said: ""We have appealed to Sukhbir Singh Badal that he should respect and accept the sentiments of workers and people and hand over the leadership of the party.""He said it was decided that the entire leadership which had ""either participated in the wrongdoings or stayed silent will appear at Akal Takht to express regret and seek forgiveness in writing. We shall also perform ardas (prayer in Sikhism) to seek strength from the Guru to save us from such blunders in future"".While the meeting in Jalandhar was on, two separate resolutions were passed at the meeting in Chandigarh chaired by Badal. ""Frustrated elements sponsored by BJP to float a parallel party or weaken the party from within can be seen in full swing. But these will not be allowed to succeed,"" read one of them.Party members urged Badal to take action against those who are acting as ""agents of the enemies of SAD, Panth and Punjab"".

While opposition has fielded a candidate as a ""mark of protest"", it may seek a division of votes only if TMC , which has alleged non-consultation on the issue, assures support Wednesday morning.Govt interlocutor and defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Kharge late Monday to seek support, but refused to assure him on the deputy's post.

""She is now undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART),"" jail superintendent Sitaram Sharma on Tuesday said.The revelation has put health department officials of both the states in a fix. They are now desperately hunting for ""grooms"" she'd been with.The health department in Uttarakhand has confirmed that the ""three men she came in physical contact with within the state are now HIV positive"". This disclosure came after Udham Singh Nagar's health department, in collaboration with an NGO, conducted tests on these men and initiated their treatment at an ART centre. The process is on for testing other family members of the infected men as well. Three of them are already HIV positive.According to police, the woman (in her 20s) was part of a gang which specialised in arranging ""marriages"" with local men. Other members would become the bride's relatives to avoid suspicion. After several cases were reported from parts of UP and Uttarakhand, seven members of the gang, including the woman and her mother, were held and sent to jail in Muzaffarnagar.Jail superintendent in Muzaffarnagar, Sitaram Sharma, said on Tuesday, ""Once in jail, her medical examination was conducted at the district hospital where her HIV-positive status was confirmed. Ever since, her antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment has been going on."" During the arrest, the woman had revealed she had ""married"" five times, including three men from Uttarakhand.

HC directed the home to release the minor on bail with his custody not to be with any grandparent.The Juvenile Justice Board had, while granting bail to the minor on May 19, ordered that he be handed over to the grandparents' custody after his grandfather gave an undertaking.HC said he could be handed over to the care of his aunt, who filed a habeas corpus plea in HC for his release alleging illegal detention. The aunt lives in New Delhi.""We are bound by law, the aims and objectives of the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, and must treat him as any child in conflict with law (CCL), despite the seriousness or heinousness of the crime,"" said a two-judge bench of Justices Bharati Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande.The teen was allegedly speeding in his luxury car in an intoxicated state on May 19 when it crashed into a bike, killing two software engineers, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta.HC said the immediate reaction to the accident, the outcry of the public, and the ""clarion call given"" led to the prosecution seeking to try him as an adult. ""His age needs to be considered... CCLs are to be considered differently, and not as adults. We allow the habeas corpus and order his release,"" the court said. Reading out the operative part of the judgment, the bench said, ""A demand is made by the prosecution to accuse him of a heinous offence and try him as an adult which may receive due consideration.""HC asked public prosecutor H S Venegaonkar under which legal provision teen was sent back to observation home after his release on bail. HC reasoned that in the absence of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 providing for the juvenile's remand, ""the procedure adopted by the Board in extending"" his remand under CrPC was ""not applicable in case of a child who is already released on bail"".Speaking of ""the rehabilitation and reintegration of the child in conflict with law,"" HC said that is ""the primary object of the Act"" and ""he is already referred to a psychologist and is undergoing therapy with a de-addiction centre, and he shall continue participating in such sessions.""","HC said the immediate reaction to the accident, the outcry of the public, and the ""clarion call given"" led to the prosecution seeking to try him as an adult.

PM Modi likely to visit Russia next month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-likely-to-visit-russia-next-month/articleshow/111267688.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Moscow next month for the India-Russia annual summit, the highest institutionalised dialogue mechanism between the two countries. While an official announcement is awaited, both sides are exploring dates in the second week of July for the proposed day-long visit. July 9 is one of the dates being considered.If the visit happens, and with no other foreign visit scheduled for the PM in the next few weeks, it may also turn out to be Modi's first bilateral visit since the inauguration of his third consecutive term in office earlier this month. Previously, he has chosen to visit countries in the neighbourhood after assuming office.The visit will take place days after the SCO summit in Astana, which Modi has decided to skip this time. It will also be his first visit to the country since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Modi, in fact, last visited Russia in 2019. The PM is expected to visit Russia again later this year for the BRICS summit.While 21 such annual summits have taken place so far alternatively in India and Russia, this will be the first time Modi will travel to Russia for the same since 2019. The summit couldn't take place in 2020 because of Covid-19 but President Vladimir Putin did come the next year for the 21st summit, although only for a few hours. Modi was expected to travel to Russia for the next summit in 2022 but that summit never materialised amid increasing global uncertainty and Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine war.A Putin aide was quoted as saying Tuesday preparations are on for the visit.While the leaders did meet on the margins of the SCO summit in Samarkand in 2022, where Modi told Putin this isn't the era of war, the upcoming meeting under the annual summit mechanism will provide them an opportunity to undertake the most comprehensive review of bilateral relations - spanning across energy, defence, trade, nuclear cooperation, defence and space - since Putin's visit to India in 2021.There has been a dramatic growth in energy ties between the two countries since the outbreak of the war, mainly because of India's decision to ramp up oil imports from Russia despite the objections raised initially by the West. India and China remain the only major countries to have not explicitly condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine.Like in the 2021 summit, the meeting on this occasion too will witness the signing of several agreements and MoUs. Russia said last week it has finalised a draft logistics agreement for intensifying military exchanges but India has remained silent on the issue. A Kremlin spokesman had said in March Modi had an open invitation to visit Russia and that Moscow in any case was expecting bilateral talks in the first half of the year on the margins of a multilateral event. There were concerns that Russia may have reservations about Modi not himself attending the SCO summit but the standalone visit to Moscow will likely take care of that.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Moscow next month for the India-Russia annual summit.

There have been no talks, unfortunately this has been a unilateral decision,"" Banerjee told the media, to express the disappointment.TMC has not signed the nomination papers of Suresh on Tuesday, for the election of Speaker.Even if TMC agrees to sign up for Suresh, Mamata Banerjee’s has clearly been unhappy about the Congress taking an unilateral decision on behalf of the INDIA bloc parties and ensured that the displeasure was communicated to the Congress leadership, at a time when the opposition is trying to put its best foot forward together, to take on the ruling BJP-led NDA government.Later, on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi and Abhishek Banerjee were spotted chatting inside the Lok Sabha chamber.

NEW DELHI: Army has announced phase II of Agniveer recruitment process . ""This phase marks a significant milestone in the Army's efforts to transform its requirements procedures and ensure a seamless and efficient selection process for aspiring candidates. It is free, fair, and transparent so all candidates are advised not to approach any type of tout,"" PRO defence, Guwahati said, reports ANI.

Agnipath recruitment scheme was rolled out in June 2022 for short-term induction of personnel with the aim of bringing down the age profile of the three services. Under the scheme, recruitment of youths between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years is done with a provision to retain 25% of them for 15 more years. The recruitment process involves two phases, the first being an online written examination and the second being the recruitment rally.

Recently, a group of secretaries from 10 key ministries were tasked to review the scheme. They were asked to suggest ways to make the armed forces recruitment programme more attractive.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest. When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling. The system will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year. Gadkari said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111267456,imgsize-1058481,width-400,resizemode-4/111267456.jpg"

NHIDCL accused of serious corruption in Tripura’s road construction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhidcl-accused-of-serious-corruption-in-tripuras-road-construction/articleshow/111266385.cms,"AGARTALA: After the repeated collapse of newly built National Highways in Tripura in the past three months in several locations, National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) authority has been accused of faulty construction compromising quality.There is another allegation against NHIDCL that in the name of widening the roads, thousands of old trees were chopped off. However, the contractors in connivance with the officials of NHIDCL and State Forest department assessed less number of trees and paid less to the compensation funds, especially in the Champaknagar area, Manu-Kanchanpur section, and Amtali-Sabroom section of National Highway.The officials here on Tuesday said NHIDCL was created in 2015 to speed up the highway construction in Northeastern states and in the last five years at least 22 roads across Tripura have been awarded to NHIDCL from state PWD.In all the cases, complaints came for poor work and not following the engineering codes, which the experts advised to maintain in the hill region, officials stated.“Most unusually roads collapsed in several locations on Agartala-Sabroom National Highway, Agartala-Kailashahar via Khowai and Kamalpur National Highway, Agartala-Churaibari National Highway, and Vaghmun-Simlung section on NH-44A within two and three years of construction causing damaged to private properties and sufferings in public life,” said officials.The issue got complicated after villagers from Vanghmun in Jampui Hill, along the Tripura-Mizoram border in the eastern boundary of the state, agitated last week and submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister demanding save Tlaksih village, which has faced a threat of existence due to construction of NH 44A connecting Agartala (Tripura) with Aizawl (Mizoram).The villagers alleged due to negligence, apathy, and arrogance of NHIDCL as many as 65 houses having 272 population in the face of imminent disaster.Based on the memorandum, Additional Secretary of Tripura government Tamal Majumdar wrote to the MD NHIDCL describing that additional cracks have been developed in the affected Tlaksih Village.The villagers are living in fear of further disasters, prompting them to protest on the street and there is multiple media coverage on the aggrieved situation of Tlaksih Village.With the onset of monsoon season, landslides have already occurred in several areas along NH-44A, turning it into a high-risk zone. However, the matter has been unresolved for more than a year, and asked him to consider it as ‘Top Most Priority’.Tlaksih, a picturesque century-old village in Jampui Hill witnessed severe landslides after construction work of the NH 44A Manu-Simlung section was started by NHIDCL.The villagers complained eastern half of the village had slid and sank and a year ago developed further cracks, making a large area inhabitable believed to be unscientific alignment and construction.“At least 14 houses have been already damaged and abandoned, and about seven acres of plantation crops have already been destroyed, 30 graves have been damaged and the villagers had to re-bury the mortal remains exposed in a makeshift donated land,” the villagers alleged.The lone government school of the village is also affected by the slide and has to be abandoned and the only approach road towards the village centre is too steep and curvy, they pointed out.Meanwhile, experts observed that NHIDCL didn’t follow the engineering norms when it came to the construction of roads in Tripura. In the name of straightening roads, they cut down the hills without proper assessment of topography, river course, and soil pattern.As a result, all those newly built roads in Tripura became vulnerable, and added, “Future of these roads is very critical because, after five years when NHIDCL contractors hand over them to state PWD, the state government cannot maintain them as there will be a regular fault.”","National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) has been accused of faulty construction compromising quality.

Income criteria set to be tweaked for MIGs to be eligible for govt aid for building houses in urban areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/income-criteria-set-to-be-tweaked-for-migs-to-be-eligible-for-govt-aid-for-building-houses-in-urban-areas/articleshow/111266085.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is set to bring down the income criteria for middle income groups (MIGs) to be eligible for getting govt assistance for buying or building houses in cities and towns under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban), which is likely to be part of the full budget for 2024-25.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.
