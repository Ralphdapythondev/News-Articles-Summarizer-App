NEW DELHI: Congress candidate from North West Delhi Lok Sabha constituency Udit Raj said that after the results of the General Elections are declared all parties of the INDIA bloc will decide on their course of action and may even hit the streets to save democracy.""The leaders of all parties will decide about the options. There will be discussions and then the course of action will be communicated. We will hit the streets to save democracy because democracy is not their (BJP) heritage. It is the heritage of the Congress party...They (BJP) do not believe in democracy, they want to change the Constitution...,"" Udit Raj said speaking to on Monday day before the counting of votes.Dismissing the results of the exit polls, Raj alleged that it seems that these were drafted at the BJP office or there might be a big conspiracy and the results to the Lok Sabha may have been already pre-determined.""The way the exit polls have predicted the results this time it seems that it has been drafted at the BJP office. I am not at all on the same page with the exit poll results. Either it is a big conspiracy or it has already been predetermined. It is possible that they hired any agency like they had hired Pegasus,"" the Congress leader said.Speaking about the performance of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections , Raj said, ""According to ground reports, their (BJP) voters did not come out. The Mandir issue did not work. In the end, PM Modi gave statements like selling of buffaloes, snatching of mangalsutra, there will be no water, Pakistan..""On the performance of the opposition in the Lok Sabha polls, he said, ""It is clear that INDIA bloc will form the government. In Delhi, all seven seats will be won by the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress contested jointly.""Speaking about his constituency the Congress candidate said, ""Today I interacted with several people of my Lok Sabha constituency. It does not seem even remotely that the BJP is in contest in North West Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.""Raj said that those who support the BJP did not come out to vote in his constituency.""I have been to all seven assembly constituencies in my Lok Sabha. Those who do not support the BJP were standing in the queue. I know who supports the BJP because I have been with them from 2014 to 2019. All those faces were missing. There was complacency as well since there was a 4-day holiday,"" the Congress leader said.""The BJP people did not brave the sun on voting day, Dalits voted in large numbers on the issue of the Constitution, Muslims voted for their safety, farmers who were agitated also voted, and the youth were also complaining because of inflation and unemployment. They were not voting in the name of PM Modi. I don't understand how they will win votes,"" he added.The BJP won all seven seats in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

How heel-prick can save an infant’s life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-heel-prick-can-save-an-infants-life/articleshow/110684728.cms,"Newborn screening

can detect inherited but treatable developmental and

metabolic disorders

early, addressing health issues in babies before they become ill

Newborn screening (NBS) is a critical healthcare initiative conducted shortly after birth to detect serious inherited developmental and metabolic disorders that are treatable. This proactive approach allows for pre-symptomatic detection and intervention, preventing irreversible complications such as mental retardation, long-term physical disabilities, or even premature death. Essentially, newborn screening identifies and addresses potential health issues in babies before they become ill.Universal newborn screening began in the United States in the mid-1960s when Dr Robert Guthrie pioneered the first screening test for Phenylketonuria (PKU). By the mid-1990s, the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) expanded the range of disorders that could be detected from dried blood spots. Today, nearly all newborns in the US are screened for about 62 disorders, including both core and secondary conditions, as recommended by the Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).Globally, 40 million babies are screened annually, representing about 28% of infants born each year. Most countries now adhere to the RUSP recommended list, which includes a variety of metabolic disorders.Inherited Errors of Metabolism (IEMs), often lifethreatening, typically manifest after an initial period of apparent good health, ranging from hours to weeks following an uncomplicated pregnancy and full-term birth. Preliminary symptoms can be non-specific, such as weight loss, growth challenges, seizures, and unusual odours in sweat or urine, leading to missed diagnoses. IEMs result from enzyme defects in biochemical and metabolic pathways, affecting the breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and causing toxic build-up.Metabolic disorders that are tested can be grouped into categories such as organic acid, fatty acid, amino acid and carbohydrate disorders, glycogen storage disease, and lysosomal storage disorders. While individual IEMs are rare, they are collectively common with an overall incidence greater than 1 in 1,000 births. Other disorders screened for include hearing impairment, critical congenital heart disease, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital Hypothyroidism, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, and Severe Combined ImmunoDeficiency (SCID).Newborn screening uses noninvasive hearing tests, pulse oximetry for critical congenital heart disease, and blood spot tests analysed by Tandem Mass Spectrometry, fluorometry, and immunoassays. A heel-prick is used to collect the baby’s blood on special filter paper and screenings are conducted 24-48 hours after birth, ensuring accurate results after the baby has received breast milk or formula. Pilot studies in several countries are exploring the integration of genetic sequencing to expand the screening panel to 400 genetic disorders . The goal is to create a multi-tier approach using both biochemical and genetic tests to improve accuracy and reduce false positives and missed cases.In India, dried blood spot screening benefits are increasingly recognised, yet a cohesive national strategy for implementing a universal NBS programme is lacking. There is no clear guidance on which prevalent disorders should be included in the screening panel. Regions such as Chandigarh, Kerala, and Goa have initiated NBS programmes in govt hospitals, screening for about eight genetic disorders. Kerala’s ‘Shalabham’ programme, launched in 2018, screens 150,000 newborns a year in 90 hospitals. In states without govt-sponsored initiatives, a few leading children’s hospitals conduct extended newborn screenings through private NBS laboratories.India, with nearly 28 million births annually, accounts for one-fifth of the world’s childbirths. Tamil Nadu, a relatively developed state with a low birth rate, sees more than 1.1 million live births yearly. Reports indicate that 13 of 100 babies born in 2021-2022 were under the recommended birth weight, signaling potential metabolic illness or mortality risks. Notably, since the inception of the National Health Mission (NHM) in 2005, Tamil Nadu’s infant mortality rate has declined from 37 in 2005 to 8.5 in 2023, which is exceptionally lower than the national average. However, premature death or mortality alone does not fully capture the burden of disease borne by different populations.The overall burden of disease is assessed using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), representing the loss of one year of full health. DALYs for a disease or health condition are the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of healthy life lost due to disability. The leading cause of DALYs globally is neonatal conditions and birth defects, which is several-fold higher than measles, tuberculosis, and respiratory infections. A March report from WHO mentions that the South Asia region witnessed improvement in under-five mortality, but the contribution of birth defects has increased from 4% to 11% in the past two decades. Universal newborn screening in India can significantly reduce DALYs by enabling early treatment and accurate management, thereby improving long-term health outcomes.Implementing universal NBS in Tamil Nadu presents significant benefits and considerable challenges. The estimated annual cost for the small programme is about ₹80 crore with a significant benefit-to-cost ratio (1.8 to 6). The economic benefits of preventing intellectual disabilities and reducing DALY scores far outweigh the costs of screening, surveillance, and management.Challenges include operational management, sample delivery delays, and increased lab rejections of blood spot samples. Addressing these would include establishing a primary screening lab centre equipped with advanced mass spectrometry and genetic sequencing and developing an efficient sample delivery system to mail blood cards from hospitals to screening labs. Additionally, creating a notification system to alert primary care physicians and parents about positive results and setting up certified diagnostic labs for accurate confirmatory tests.Many developing countries, including the Philippines, have successfully implemented universal screening programmes, demonstrating that it is feasible and beneficial. Tamil Nadu should consider a phased or universal screening programme for all newborns, and perhaps serve as a model for the rest of India.","Newborn screening identifies and addresses potential health issues in babies before they become ill. 40 million babies are screened annually, representing about 28% of infants born each year.

The cabinet decision includes amending necessary laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the Maldives and establishing a cabinet subcommittee to oversee these efforts.""Given Israel's close ties with India, the ban is unlikely to go down well with Indian travellers who the island is trying to woo again after ""Boycott Maldives"" had trended in India earlier this year.","Maldives had Sunday announced a cabinet decision to change laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the country.

There was no problem with the weighing machine. His other vitals, including blood pressure and sugar, are normal,"" a senior Tihar jail officer told news agency PTI.""Kejriwal is given the insulin twice a day and is under a regular watch of two doctors in the prisons,"" the officer said.On the allegation of not providing a cooler, the official stated that it is only provided to those inmates, who are unwell and the court orders the authorities to do so.","Aam Aadmi Party claims Arvind Kejriwal was not provided with cooler in his cell despite soaring temperatures in Delhi.

"Pattern in fake narratives, we failed to stop them: CEC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pattern-in-fake-narratives-we-failed-to-stop-them-cec/articleshow/110679347.cms,"Such allegations have potential to spark anarchy, says

CEC

NEW DELHI: Sensing a “pattern” in levelling of unverified allegations and casting of doubts on well-established electoral processes — related to voters list , EVMs , VVPATs or counting — during general elections , chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar on Monday said these were part of the “mischievous narratives” directed at EC that the poll panel had failed to foresee and prepare against.“We (EC) factored in fake news, fake narratives between parties to create arguments ... and we contained them. We had even braced our systems against likely false narratives from foreign soil, only to face these from within. We concede that EC failed to stop the mischievous narratives . While I had warned in March that there will be conspiracy balloons in these polls, we never imagined these would burst on EC’s head,” Kumar said at a press conference here.Pointing to the opposition’s attacks on EC through the polls, the CEC joked that “you may see memes on social media that the Laapata Gentlemen are back”. “But we were always there. We just chose to interact with you (media) through our press notes,” he said.CEC Kumar termed ‘mischievous narratives’ as the fifth ‘M’ in addition to the four Ms listed as poll challenges by him in March 2024 — namely money power, muscle power, model code violations and misinformation. He said while the opposition and all stakeholders had a right to raise questions, any allegation or doubts must be backed by proof so as to not create doubts in the minds of voters regarding the sanctity of the electoral processes and offer EC an opportunity to rectify the errors.“One of the learnings from the current polls is that we should be far more prepared for such fake narratives from within,” Kumar added.The CEC said some of the electoral processes challenged during the current election were pending before courts since 2019, with poll panel having filed affidavits detailing its stance, but were taken up just before polling. Even the issue of change in rule on postal ballots came up just ahead of counting, when the new rule was neither challenged in 2019 nor during the 2021-22 state polls held thereafter. This pointed to a pattern of setting a false narrative only during the general election, he added.“Four days before polling, there was an allegation regarding errors in the voters list. A case was filed and we spent 15 days preparing our affidavit. Tell us during non-election time where the errors are. There can be 2-4% errors but tell us where these are 94-98%. Such allegations come when elections are imminent... create a spark so that there is some scope for mischief. After polls began, EVMs were challenged. Such allegations had the potential to spark anarchy at the national level,” he said.Stating that the case was pending since 2023 and that the poll panel had filed a reply, Kumar said it was suddenly taken up four days before Phase I. He said a similar pattern was seen in 2019, with a case having come up four days before the first phase. “Between 2019 and 2024, you should have raised this matter before us. We could have taken some action. There is a pattern, design (to raise issues) only during a general election, though I am not hinting at a toolkit,” he said.On the allegation regarding delay and manipulation of voter turnout, he said, “We did not delay turnout data even by one day and nor can voter turnout be ramped up by even 1%. Voter Turnout app is updated in real time... the public and EC see the same figures,” he added.","Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said the poll panel had failed to foresee and prepare against the ‘mischievous narratives’ directed at EC. “We (EC) factored in fake news, fake narratives between parties to create arguments... and we contained them,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110679381,imgsize-1222179,width-400,resizemode-4/110679381.jpg"

NEW DELHI: On the eve of Lok Sabha elections counting day, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday wrote a letter to civil servants and officers urging them to discharge their duties ""in the spirit of the Constitution, without any coercion, threat, pressure or intimidation either from the ruling party/coalition or from the opposition party/coalition"".Contending that ""the last decade has witnessed a systemic pattern to assault, undermine and suppress our autonomous institutions by the ruling party"", Kharge urged the bureaucracy ""to adhere to the Constitution, enact their duties, and serve the nation, without fear, favour and ill-will against anybody"".""Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any Unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant Democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India,"" he added.An Appeal to all the Civil Servants and OfficersMy dear esteemed members of bureaucracy, our civil servants & officers,I am writing you in the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition (Rajya Sabha) and as President of the Indian National Congress . The elections for the 18th Lok Sabha have concluded and the counting of votes shall take place tomorrow, on June 4th, 2024.I must congratulate the Election Commission of India, the Central Armed Forces, Police in various states, Civil Servants, District Collectors, Volunteers and each one of you who were involved in conducting this mammoth and historic task.Our inspiration and India’s First Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel famously called the civil servants as the “Steel frame of India.” The people of India are well aware that it is the Indian National Congress which established numerous institutions, laid their solid foundation, and devised mechanisms for their independence, on the basis of the Constitution of India.Independence of the institutions is paramount, for every civil servant takes oath of the Constitution that they “will faithfully and conscientiously discharge their duties and will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will”. In this spirit we expect every bureaucrat and officer – from top to bottom of the hierarchy, to discharge their duties in the spirit of the Constitution, without any coercion, threat, pressure or intimidation either from the ruling party/coalition or from the opposition party/coalition.It is important to underline the fact that the Congress party, through the Constitution prepared by our inspirational founding members such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr B R Ambedkar, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Maulana Azad, Sarojini Naidu and countless others, not only created a framework of strong governance, but also ensured affirmative action through representation of the marginalised in the bureaucracy and the civil society, in our autonomous institutions.The last decade has witnessed a systemic pattern to assault, undermine and suppress our autonomous institutions by the ruling party. India’s Democratic ethos are being consequently damaged. There is a widespread tendency to turn India into a regimental dictatorship. We are increasingly seeing some institutions shedding their independence and brazenly following the diktats of the ruling party. Some have completely adopted their style of communication, their way of functioning, and in some cases even their political rhetoric. It is not their fault. With brute power, threat, coercive mechanisms and misuse of agencies, this tendency to bow to the powers that have become a way for their short-term survival. Even though, in this denigration, India’s Constitution and Democracy have become a casualty.The ‘Will of the People’ is supreme, and people want Indian bureaucracy, to return back to the same ‘Steel frame of India’ envisaged by Sardar Patel – which has been Teflon-coated by our strong Constitutional principles, that have stood the test of the time.Indian National Congress now urges the entire bureaucracy, to adhere to the Constitution, enact their duties, and serve the nation, without fear, favour and ill-will against anybody. Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any Unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant Democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India.In this hope that India remains truly Democratic in nature, I extend good wishes to each one of you, and expect that our eternal ideals of the Constitution remain untarnished.","Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to civil servants and officers on Monday.

Kumar held a meeting with his party leaders too.Sources said the Union cabinet will hold its last meeting on Wednesday morning, a day after the poll results, after which ministers will resign, paving the way for formation of the next govt.Sources also said the cabinet will pass a proposal endorsing the Modi govt’s performance in the past 10 years, setting narratives like “politics of performance” and “last mile delivery”, and highlighting the execution of welfare schemes like Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojna, free ration scheme, Ayushman Bharat health insurance cover, free LPG connections and other development initiatives.The cabinet proposal is likely to make special mention also of abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and banning the practice of triple talaq, besides introduction of the new criminal justice system.Hopeful of a landslide, preparations are also on for celebrations, including the possibility of a march led by the PM, to be capped by Modi’s customary victory speech.","BJP brass and NDA functionaries buoyed by predictions of exit polls.

BHUBANESWAR: An exit poll by Times Now-ETG predicted on Monday a near-repeat of the 2019 landslide for Naveen Patnaik ’s BJD in the Odisha assembly polls, differing from other projections that show the party either neck and neck with challenger BJP or not ahead by much.BJD is likely to win 100 to 115 seats in the 147-member assembly, with a projected vote share of 46%, the exit poll says. In 2019, BJD won 112 seats with a 44.7% vote share. BJP is tipped to get between 30 and 38 seats, with a vote share of around 38%. If this holds, it will be an improvement on the saffron party’s 2019 performance, when it won 23 seats with a 32.49% vote share. Congress is expected to face a significant setback, with the exit poll suggesting the grand old party may win four to seven seats with an 11% vote share. In 2019, Congress had nine seats with a 17.02% vote share.“People of Odisha’s faith in BJD is unwavering. With the blessings of Mahaprabhu Jagannath and the love of people, CM Naveen Patnaik will script history by winning a record 6th term,” BJD Rajya Sabha member Manas Mangaraj wrote on X.The exit poll projection has shored up BJD’s morale, especially after some agencies predicted over the weekend that the regional party might cede ground to BJP. The India Today-Axis exit poll, released on Sunday, suggested a close contest between BJD and BJP, with both parties projected to win between 62 and 80 seats. The poll put Congress at five to eight seats.Lok Sabha exit polls released on Saturday showed BJP might get between 13 and 19 of the 21 seats in Odisha, up from its 2019 tally of eight. BJD, which won 12 in 2019, is expected to win between two and seven seats. Congress might retain its lone seat or draw a blank. “Change has already happened. People have given their mandate to BJP, which will form the next govt in the state,” state BJP president Manmohan Samal said.Describing the exit polls as “doctored and motivated”, Congress’s Jayadev Jena said all exit polls would be proven wrong on Tuesday.","BJD is likely to win 100 to 115 seats in the 147-member assembly.

A day after Maldives barred the entry of Israeli passport holders, the Israel embassy in India has promoted “some beautiful and amazing Indian beaches where Israeli tourists are warmly welcomed and treated with utmost hospitality.” These include Lakshadweep — which was in the news earlier this year when Indian tourists were wondering why they should go to Maldives when their own country has its own beautiful islands. The other recommendations by the embassy are: Goa, Andaman Nicobar and Kerala.“Since the Maldives is no longer welcoming Israelis, here are some beautiful and amazing Indian beaches where Israeli tourists are warmly welcomed and treated with utmost hospitality. Check out these recommendations from (the embassy) based on the places visited by our diplomats,” Israel’s embassy in India Tweeted Monday.Maldives government had on Sunday announced a cabinet decision to change laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the country over the ongoing war in Gaza. “For Israeli citizens already in the country, it is recommended to consider leaving, because if they find themselves in distress for any reason, it will be difficult for us to assist,” Maldives’ foreign ministry had said in a statement.As far as tourism is concerned, Maldives has been in the news for the wrong reasons since the start of this year. A visit by Prime Minister Modi to idyllic Lakshadweep led to anti-India tweets by some of Maldives’ politicians. After that, Maldives fell off the bucket list for Indian travellers. An Indian online travel agency, EaseMyTrip, had stopped bookings for Maldives.“EaseMyTrip has halted Maldives bookings from January 8 until today.

"Insolvency proceedings ordered against JAL, flagship firm of Jaiprakash Group",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insolvency-proceedings-ordered-against-jal-flagship-firm-of-jaiprakash-group/articleshow/110679662.cms,"Buyers with registered JAL properties won’t be hit

NEW DELHI: National Company Law Tribunal on Monday ordered the initiation of insolvency proceedings against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd ( JAL ), six years after lenders led by ICICI Bank first sought action.The move will impact the company’s real estate business in Noida and Greater Noida, although the scale of operation in this company is much smaller than Jaypee Infratech , which was admitted for insolvency action in 2018, when ICICI had also moved against JAL. Two years ago, with JAL defaulting on repayments, State Bank of India too had moved the tribunal against the company which was identified among two dozen for fast-track resolution.JAL, the flagship company of the Jaiprakash Group has real estate projects under the Wish Town brand in Noida, where delivery of some units is pending, although the exact number was not immediately available. In its last annual report, the company had said that it had offered possession of over 21,000 residential units till March 2023.With the initiation of insolvency proceedings against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), an NCLT-appointed resolution professional will take charge with the board led by the Gaurs becoming defunct.The move will not impact buyers of JAL apartments and villas whose properties have been registered.While the case against it was pending, JAL had sold large plots of land in its Noida “township” to companies such as Max and Kalpataru, which are building high-end residential properties. Apart from real estate, the company has interests in cement, hotels, power and EPC. The company reported a loss of over Rs 1,500 crore during the last financial year.In a stock exchange filing last month, JAL had said it had borrowings of a little under Rs 30,000 crore, and the defaults added up to Rs 4,616 crore. Weighed by massive debt, JAL had sought to deleverage, selling large parts of its cement and power businesses.It still has a massive EPC construction business, building dams and power projects from Bhutan and Nepal to Gujarat and Telangana. The company had also built the marquee Formula 1 track, the first in the country, but could not hold on to it as the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority took over the land due to non-payment of lease rental.Meanwhile, Suraksha Group, whose resolution plan for Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) was approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) last week, is likely to take over the debt-ridden company after a meeting next week.The move will take the Mumbai-based Suraksha Group a step closer to resuming construction on nine stalled projects of Wish Town in Noida and other locations and renew hopes for 20,000 buyers who invested in flats 15-20 years ago.As of now, JIL’s daily affairs are managed by an implementation and monitoring committee (IMC). Set up by the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ), the committee is made up of officials from Suraksha, JIL, homebuyers and an IRP.","The move will impact the company’s real estate business in Noida and Greater Noida.

MUMBAI: Supreme Court ’s vacation bench on Monday stayed till July 15 the remission and premature release from prison permitted by the Bombay HC to convicted gangsterand barred his exit from custody till then.The SC bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and Sandeep Mehta issued a notice to Gawli, stating, “There shall be an interim stay of the impugned order, till the next date of hearing.”Gawli is serving a rigorous life imprisonment sentence after an Aug 2012 conviction for murder of Shiv Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar in 2007 as well in 2008 and 2009 special cases under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). The life sentence is life till end of natural life, SC has held time and again. The state, however, has a remission policy in place for lifers.The state had filed a special leave petition (SLP) seeking to challenge the April 5 judgment of the Nagpur bench of Bombay HC that permitted the gangster’s early release, citing a 2006 state policy for remission, called ‘premature release policy’.The state, represented by senior counsel Raja Thakare, said the high court order was “ misconceived” as the law provides power to remit a sentence to the govt. SC had in a 1976 ruling said only govt possesses the sole discretion of granting remission to a convict and the state is, thus, arguing now that HC cannot compel govt to release a prisoner.The high court, in its April order, had given the state four weeks to pass consequential orders for implementation of the remission.The state’s SLP said Gawli is a ‘hardened criminal-turned-politician’ convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in a crime syndicate case and has other pending cases against him, including some under the stringent MCOCA. It said that the high court failed to consider the potential impact on society at large before permitting Gawli’s release.SC vacation bench said since it’s a matter of policy, it requires consideration and, thus, stayed implementation of the HC judgment.","Gawli is serving a rigorous life imprisonment sentence after an Aug 2012 conviction for murder of Shiv Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar.

Gandhi made the remarks after attending an event here to pay tribute to DMK stalwart M Karunanidhi on his 100th birth anniversary.On the eve of counting, Congress continued to talk up the possibility of the results being rigged even as it denied that it had finalised a detailed protest plan in the event of the results being on the lines of the exit polls.At the same time, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge appealed to bureaucrats to discharge their duties “without coercion or political pressure”, reinforcing concerns the opposition has expressed in the wake of the exit polls.“Do not get intimidated by anyone. Do not bow down to any unconstitutional means. Do not be afraid of anyone and discharge your duties, based on merit, on this counting day. We owe it to future generations, a vibrant democracy and a long-lasting Constitution, as penned by the makers of modern India,” Kharge said in a public appeal.Congress also asked all its workers to be vigilant during counting of votes, be present in their district and state headquarters and report any kind of mischief to the party’s monitoring cell . The party has informed all party workers that a monitoring centre will be open 24x7 at AICC headquarters in Delhi where any kind of wrongdoing noticed during the counting process must be reported.The party called for caution, claiming that in the past few days they had seen BJP and its govt “violate the democratic and constitutional process” during elections.A news agency handle had posted a story claiming that INDIA bloc leaders had been asked to reach the national capital by Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and they would thrash out a plan for public protests if results were not up to their estimates.Replying to the post, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, “INDIA leaders will obviously meet after the results are declared. Any other meaning being given to it is completely misleading and false.” Another senior office-bearer said there was no such plan in the party.",Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge appealed to bureaucrats to discharge their duties ‘without coercion or political pressure’ A monitoring centre will be open 24x7 at AICC headquarters in Delhi where any kind of wrongdoing noticed during the counting process must be reported.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110678040,imgsize-1617309,width-400,resizemode-4/110678040.jpg"
