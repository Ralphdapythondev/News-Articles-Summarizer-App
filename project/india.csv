Centre's 'Lakhpati Didi' initiative transforming lives of rural women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-lakhpati-didi-initiative-transforming-lives-of-rural-women/articleshow/112753457.cms,"JHANSI: In the heart of rural India, a quiet revolution is unfolding, driven by the resilience and determination of women who once confined their aspirations to the four walls of their homes.Through the empowering framework of self-help groups (SHGs) under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), these women are not only transforming their own lives but also setting an inspiring example for others.From managing government ration shops to becoming adept entrepreneurs, these women, now proudly known as ""Lakhpati Didis"" -- women earning over a lakh of rupees through their entrepreneurial efforts are rewriting the narrative of empowerment and self-sufficiency in their communities.Veena, who manages a government ration shop, started her journey when a National Rural Livelihood Mission officer connected her with a self-help group.""When I first got married and came here, I didn't do anything. Then an officer from the NRLM (National Rural Livelihood Mission) came and connected us with a self-help group,"" she said.""After joining the group, we gathered the women and started running the group efficiently. I took on the responsibility of managing the accounts, which slightly increased my income. Later, as I started going out more, I learned about the possibility of running this shop. Since then, we have been running this ration shop,"" she added.Earlier, ration shops were managed by men, and women didn't come out to get the rations. But since women like us started running the shop, the women who used to stay at home now come out to get their rations. Along with that, they also seek advice from us regarding the self-help group, asking about what needs to be done, and we guide them. This has encouraged them to start their own work, Veena added.Earlier, we didn't do anything, but after starting this work, we've seen some benefits and have begun doing more, added Veena.Expressing happiness over Prime Minister Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi on August 25, Veena said, ""We are very happy that we have reached this point and that we will be honored there. It's a matter of great joy for us. The government schemes that we are getting are helping and benefitting us a lot, and we are progressing significantly.""Hemlata, who owns a clothing shop in Jhansi's Simrawari village, took a loan of Rs 2 lakh from a self-help group to start her business. Over time, her shop's value has grown to Rs 6 lakh and was able to repay her loan.""I first joined the self-help group. After joining, I took a loan of 2 lakh rupees from the group. With that 2 lakh rupees, I opened a shop. Gradually, with those 2 lakh rupees, I kept increasing my stock, selling and purchasing goods. I benefited so much that today, I have a shop worth 6 lakh rupees. I have completely repaid my loan. Recently, during the 8-10 days of Sawan, I sold goods worth 70 to 80 thousand rupees,"" said Hemlata.Before this, we didn't do anything. We stayed at home and only did household chores. When we met with people, they suggested that I open a clothing shop or start some other work. Everyone helped me a lot, Hemlata said.We are very grateful to the government. We thank PM Modi for making every effort to help us move forward and turn women into Lakhpati Didis. It brings us great joy to see women doing excellent work. The women in our self-help group are all engaged in some kind of work, she added.On PM Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi, Hemlata said, ""I am feeling very happy. Earlier, women didn't do much. They were just confined to cooking and household chores. But now, look at how far women have come. Every woman is progressing through the self-help group.""Sheela Singh, a Vidyut Sakhi, collects electricity bills from homes and assists those unable to visit the office. Sheela says that the government scheme has provided steady work. She earns around Rs 15,000-20,000 monthly, which she says has significantly improved her financial situation.""I work as Vidyut Sakhi. I go from house to house collecting bills. I started this work in 2021, so it's been almost 2-3 years now. I also sit at the electricity department and go door to door for bill collection. For those who are poor and can't come to the office, I visit their homes and give them my phone number so they can call me whenever they need to pay their bills, and I will come to their house to collect the payment,"" Sheela said.""Forms were issued at the Vidyut Vikas Bhawan. I submitted the form, and when my name was selected, I started this work. This has also provided me with financial assistance. I earn approximately Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month, which has significantly improved my financial situation. With the help of the government scheme, we got work and are now earning. We manage to collect and submit around 1,100 to 1,200 bills every month,"" Sheela added.Manisha Yadav, who works as a Banker Sakhi in Simrawari village of UP's Jhansi said, ""As a Bank Sakhi, I serve as a cadre for the women in the self-help groups, assisting them in opening their group accounts, filling out vouchers, and facilitating CCL (Cash Credit Linkage) for them.""""I used to teach in small private schools. There's been a big change in my work now. Earlier, I would barely earn around Rs 1,000-1,200, but since I started working as a Bank Sakhi, my earnings have increased to Rs 4,000. Additionally, when it comes to paying my children's fees and managing household expenses, I no longer need to rely on anyone else. I can handle everything on my own,"" she added.On PM Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi, Yadav said, ""I am very happy that we, who used to stay at home and had never seen the outside world, are now managing everything on our own and have become ""Lakhpati Didis.""

'Protest against perversion'

Badlapur protest

NEW DELHI: In a significant legal direction, the Bombay High Court on Friday issued a restraining order against any political party or individual from calling for a Maharashtra Bandh.""We are restraining any political party or individual from proceeding with call for bandh. We will also direct the State to take all steps in terms of B G Deshmukh judgment,"" said Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya.The order comes just days after the opposition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had announced plans for a statewide bandh on August 24 to protest against an incident of rape of two minors in Badlapur.The HC issued notice to the Congress, Shiv Sena-UBT and Sharad Pawar-NCP, and restrained them from proceeding with the call for bandh on Saturday or on any other subsequent day. The notices are made returnable on October 9.The court directed the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), DGP and district collectors shall enforce directions given in HC's 2004 judgment.After the order, NCP-SCP chief Sharad Pawar tweeted: ""In the wake of the Badlapur incident, a statewide public shutdown was called for on 24 August 2024. This was an attempt to draw the government's attention to this matter. This bandh was within the purview of the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution of India. However Bombay High Court has ruled that the bandh is unconstitutional. Urgent appeal in Supreme Court is not possible due to time limit. As the Indian Judiciary is a constitutional institution, it is requested to withdraw tomorrow's bandh while respecting the Constitution.""Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said the parties will respect the court's order.""Honouring Bombay High Court judgement, all Congress leaders will protest in all Maharashtra district headquarters with black bands on their face/mouth from 11 AM to 12 noon against the cases of sexual harassment against women and failure of Maharashtra govt to prevent that.

"Dhaka blames India for flooding, Delhi hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhaka-blames-india-for-flooding-delhi-hits-back/articleshow/112724351.cms,"NEW DELHI/DHAKA: The Indian government on Thursday strongly denied claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on the eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura, saying that floods on cross-border rivers is a shared problem on both sides. Indian govt sources also warned the interim govt against any official backing of ""misplaced"" narratives.The warning came in the wake of allegations by one of the advisers to the interim govt, Mohammad Nahid Islam, that India's ""non-cooperation"" was the reason for the flooding.""Without any prior warning and without giving us time for preparation, the dam was opened. Through this India showed an inhuman approach and is demonstrating non-cooperation with Bangladesh,"" Islam said after a meeting of the advisory council with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.Amid cross-border acrimony, there were rumours in Dhaka that Yunus had summoned Indian envoy Pranay Verma. Sources in Delhi, however, said that the request by Verma for a call was lodged several days ago and before the events related to the floods.Nahid, one of the coordinators of the protests against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who is supervising information and broadcasting affairs, hoped that India will come out from this ""anti-Bangladesh policy"".""Any official backing of such misplaced narratives is unhelpful to bilateral ties and the use of the word 'summon' is clearly an attempt at disinformation,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.In a statement, the foreign ministry said this problem requires close mutual cooperation, adding India continues to provide real-time flood data to Bangladesh as per a bilateral protocol.With the two countries sharing 54 common cross-border rivers, river water cooperation is an important part of their bilateral engagement. Looking to allay concerns in Bangladesh about India's alleged role in the floods, which followed the political crisis in the country, Indian govt said it remained committed to resolving issues and mutual concerns in water resources and river water management through bilateral consultations and technical discussions.India pointed out that the catchment areas of the Gumti river that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the past few days and the flood in the neighbouring country is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam.""Dumbur dam is located quite far from the border - over 120km upstream of Bangladesh. It is a low-height (about 30m) dam that generates power that feeds into a grid and from which Bangladesh also draws 40MW power from Tripura. Along the about 120km river course, we have three water level observation sites at Amarpur, Sonamura and Sonamura 2,"" said MEA .""Heavy rainfall has been continuing since Aug 21 in whole of Tripura and adjoining districts of Bangladesh. In the event of heavy inflow, automatic releases have been observed,"" it added, while recalling that the Amarpur station is in part of a bilateral protocol under which India is transmitting real-time flood data to Bangladesh.""Data showing a rising trend has been supplied to Bangladesh up to 3pm on Aug 21, 2024. At 6pm, due to flooding, there was a power outage, leading to problems of communication. Still, we have tried to maintain communication through other means created for urgent transmission of data,"" said govt.Heavy rainfalls have caused heavy flooding, the worst since 1956, in Tripura with more than 80% of the state capital, Agartala, waterlogged. The situation worsened in the city after it received 233mm rain on Wednesday that could not be pumped out as the Haora river was overflowing.Eight districts of Bangladesh have been flooded due to heavy rains and onrush of water from the upstream, said the ministry of disaster management and relief on Wednesday. The eight districts are Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Chattogram, Noakhali, Comilla and Khagrachhari. At least 1,796,248 people have been affected, the ministry said on Thursday.(With inputs from AKM Moinuddin in Dhaka)","India strongly denies claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura.

Supreme Court to hear Arvind Kejriwal pleas on September 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-hear-arvind-kejriwal-pleas-on-september-6/articleshow/112750433.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seeking dismissal of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal 's bail plea in the excise policy case, CBI in an affidavit told the Supreme Court on Friday that he had masterminded increase in wholesalers' commission from 5% to 12% in the 2021-22 excise policy in return for alleged Rs 100 crore in kickbacks, of which Rs 45 crore was sent through hawala for AAP 's Goa election campaign.The agency also opposed grant of interim bail to Kejriwal on health grounds and said he could be treated for his ailments in the jail hospital or any referral hospital as per the jail manual.Additional solicitor general S V Raju told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan that this affidavit was in response to one of the two petitions filed by Kejriwal and sought a week's time to file reply to the other petition. Kejriwal 's counsel, senior advocate A M Singhvi, told the bench that CBI was deliberately delaying the hearing before SC. The bench asked CBI to file the other affidavit within a week and posted Kejriwal's two petitions for hearing on Sep 6.CBI said it had arrested Kejriwal on April 26 in the corruption case relating to the excise scam after receiving the Delhi LG's approval under Section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act on April 23 to proceed against him. Enforcement Directorate had arrested him on March 21 in a money laundering case relating to the liquor scam.""Kejriwal, in connivance with other accused, deliberately tweaked/manipulated the excise policy 2021-22 and hiked profit margin of liquor wholesalers from 5% to 12% without any rationale, causing undue windfall gains to the wholesalers in lieu of an illegal gratification of Rs 100 crore from the South Group, to meet the election related expenses of AAP in Goa,"" CBI said.The agency said though the Delhi CM did not hold any ministerial portfolio, ""all decisions of the govt as well as the party are taken on his concurrence and directions. These include not only the decisions in Delhi, but also throughout the country where AAP is present"".CBI said Kejriwal's overarching control over AAP was evident from the fact that at his behest, AAP govt in Punjab had refused permission to the agency to investigate state govt officials. ""Mahadev Liquors, the third largest wholesaler in Delhi and having a substantial presence in Punjab, had refused for recoupment of maximum profits in Delhi excise policy. This led to its distilleries being closed. Only on surrendering licences of its manufacturers were the distilleries reopened. Such action raises reasonable suspicion of influence being exerted by Kejriwal, who is also AAP national convenor,"" CBI said.The central agency said the expert committee in 2020 had drafted an excise policy for Delhi proposing a govt corporation-owned wholesale model and allotment of maximum two retail shops in an area through lottery system, which did not suit Kejriwal's preconceived idea.After then deputy CM Manish Sisodia drafted a new excise policy, CM-led cabinet constituted a group of ministers in Feb 2021 to study the draft and recommend a new excise policy. ""In the first draft of the GoM report of March 15, 2021, retrieved from Sisodia's official computer, a profit margin of 5% for wholesalers was prescribed,"" CBI said.But CM, in connivance with South Group, on March 18, 2021, enhanced wholesalers' margin from 5% to 12% , which was incorporated in the final GoM report of March 22, 2021. The Delhi cabinet approved the changes recommended by the GoM in the new excise policy. Though the LG raised certain objections, and the file went back and forth for two months, the final policy with 12% profit margin for wholesalers was notified on May 25, 2021, CBI said.The agency detailed the trail of alleged kickbacks of Rs 90-100 crore, of which Rs 44.5 crore was sent through hawala channels to Goa and spent on AAP's election campaign.",CBI in an affidavit told the Supreme Court on Friday that he had masterminded increase in wholesalers' commission from 5% to 12% in the 2021-22 excise policy.

Making small satellites a piece of cake for these students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/making-small-satellites-a-piece-of-cake-for-these-students/articleshow/112749411.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a tilak on his forehead, a teen was fiddling with a nano satellite , which was small enough to fit in the palm of his hand, and explaining its role to space enthusiasts . B Srinivas was part of a team of 4-5 B.Tech students who set up a stall at a space exhibition at Bharat Mandapam on National Space Day on Friday to showcase their skills in developing nano and microsatellites.Among them, Zeel Gabani, who is also doing aeronautical engineering from the Thiruvananthapuram-based Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology like others, said, “We are not only developing these small satellites , but some of our satellites have already been launched by Isro in space on its experimental platform (POEM).” Isro nowadays uses the fourth stage of its PSLV rocket as an experimental platform after it completes its primary task of launching a satellite. Students use this platform for doing experiments in space.“We are working for the Small-Spacecraft Systems and Payload Centre (SSPACE), which is a spacecraft-making centre within our institute. It is a completely-student initiative,” the girl student said.Another student, Jacob, said a small satellite takes 3-4 years to develop. “As a satellite development is not possible with one batch, so its development is done by generations of students. Our seniors would start work on a satellite. Data is passed on to the second batch. We will work and once we pass out of the college, our juniors will resume work. There is no communication gap as the entire project is documented and our seniors mentor us well on the project even after leaving the campus.”With a smiling face, Jacob boasted that “many of our seniors are now working for Isro and leading startups like AgniKul. Over 100 alumni, now working for Isro, were involved in the Chandrayaan project”.","Isro nowadays uses the fourth stage of its PSLV rocket as an experimental platform.
