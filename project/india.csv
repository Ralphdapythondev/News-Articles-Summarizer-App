His son Rajendra Rathwa won the 2022 election on BJP's ticket from Chhota Udepur assembly seat.On February 27 this year, Naran Rathwa, a five-term former Lok Sabha member and the then sitting Rajya Sabha member shifted from the Congress to BJP.Talking to PTI, Sukhram Rathwa claimed, ""This is not likely to affect the Congress. Those who have joined the BJP have done so on their own and none of their supporters have gone with them.""""They were not working for the Congress, but helping those in the BJP. I am confident of winning,"" he said.BJP candidate Jasu Rathwa, who unsuccessfully contested against Mohansinh Rathwa in the 2017 assembly election from Chhota Udepur, also said he is getting overwhelming support of the public.""We will together make the lotus (BJP symbol) win with a lead of over 5.5 lakh votes as a tribute to PM Modi,"" he said.""Modi talks of national interest, love for the nation, reaching out to the poor and to lift them from poverty,"" he said.People have benefited from schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojana and free food grains to the poor, he said.Out of around 10 lakh tribal voters in the seat, the Rathwa community accounts for 4 lakh. The remaining are from Baria, Dhorkoli, Bhil, Tadvi, Nayka and Vasava communities.There are 2 lakh Kshatriya voters, the second largest community, whose members have been against the BJP over alleged derogatory remarks by its leader Parshottam Rupala. Muslims account for 1.22 lakh voters.Former AAP leader Arjun Rathwa, who joined the Congress recently, said theirs is a progressive community, which is not just numerically but also socially and financially better positioned than other tribal groups.""Leaders from the Rathwa community have been traditionally fielded by both the BJP and Congress, but this time the entire tribal community is with the Congress,"" he claimed.People have received the Congress' 'paanch nyay' (five guarantees) with enthusiasm. They are also upset with the BJP after a fake government office scam was busted in the district where funds worth crores of rupees were allegedly duped in the name of irrigation projects, he added.Rathwa community leaders have represented Chhota Udepur in Parliament since 1977.Amarsinh Rathwa won on Congress' ticket in 1977, 1980 and 1984.Naran Rathwa won for four consecutive terms from the Congress. He lost to BJP's Ramsinh Rathwa in 1999, won again in 2004, but faced defeat in 2009 and 2014.In 2019, BJP's Gitaben Rathwa defeated Congress' Ranjitsinh Rathwa.The BJP won all the seven assembly segments under this Lok Sabha seat in the 2022 polls.Former Union minister Naran Rathwa, who is now with the BJP, said his party is well poised to retain the seat this time also.""Now only Sukhram Rathwa is left in the Congress, all others have joined the BJP. The Congress has not won a single assembly seat and does not even have control over the district or taluka panchayat here. All Congress grassroot level workers have joined the BJP along with me,"" he said.The wind is clearly blowing in BJP's direction and people understand this because they have witnessed the transformation in this once underdeveloped region, he said.""I have been in the Rajya Sabha for six years and people are impressed by PM Modi. Those who believed in the Congress have also shifted to BJP. Only big leaders are left in the Congress, but their supporters at the grassroots have moved to the BJP,"" he claimed.A major railway route connecting Indore in Madhya Pradesh to Vadodara in Gujarat, to be completed in six months, will help the people of Chhota Udepur, especially tribal labourers who migrate for work and cut down on their travel costs, said the former Minister of State for Railways.Local social worker Somra Saeed Ahmed said the political equation in the region has changed significantly.""The development here has touched all the communities. Communal riots is a thing of the past and people find peace in the BJP rule. The local municipality is with the Congress but it has not done much for the development of urban pockets,"" he said.Vijaysinh Vasodiya, a Kshatriya community member, however, said the country needs a change in the top leadership and people should vote to oust the incumbent party.Elections to all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat will be held on May 7.",Chhota Udepur Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat will see a repeat of clash between Rathwa tribal community candidates.

RANCHI: Two empty chairs for jailed Arvind Kejriwal and Hemant Soren headlined INDIA bloc ’s bid to turn the tables on BJP at a joint rally here today as the Delhi chief minister’s wife Sunita Kejriwal led the offensive by accusing the Narendra Modi govt of conspiring to kill her diabetic husband in Tihar jail by denying him insulin.“Their politics is very dirty.Now there is a camera fixed on his food, each morsel of food is being monitored, what a shame it is. He is diabetic and has been administered 50 units of insulin for the past 12 years now. But inside the jail, he is not given any. They want to kill him,” Sunita alleged at the Ulgulan Nyay Rally here.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Kejriwal’s AAP colleague and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav were among those attended the event.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav were among those attended the event and declared that the ongoing general election was a fight to “save the Constitution and democracy”. The chorus was that the opposition bloc would not be intimidated by arm-twisting tactics like putting Kejriwal and former Jharkhand CM Hemant behind bars. Congress’s Rahul Gandhi could not make it to the event, citing illness.Other than the two empty chairs, two giant banners showing Hemant and Kejriwal behind bars were placed at the rally on Ranchi’s Prabhat Tara ground. That was to send the message that both will return soon. Kejriwal has been held in an ED case related to Delhi’s liquor policy and Hemant in an alleged Ranchi land scam.“Court has not yet found Kejriwal and Hemant guilty, yet Modi ji has put them in jail. Kejriwal has been a diabetes patient for 20 years and has been taking 50 units of insulin daily for about 12 years,” Sunita said, iterating charges about a plot to kill her husband.Sunita questioned the ED probe. “What kind of investigation is this where you put innocent people in jail without proving guilt? This is dictatorship. What is my husband’s fault? He improved govt schools in Delhi, provided good education, built hospitals and mohalla clinics,” Sunita said. Her AAP colleague Sanjay Singh declared that “these empty chairs won’t be so after poll results on June 4”.Hemant’s wife Kalpana read out a message penned by her husband from jail. “BJP had been hatching conspiracies against me for four years and put me in jail over a baseless case. In the same fashion, they put Delhi CM behind bars. This is the first time since independence when opposition leaders are being jailed in a well-planned manner before a Lok Sabha election,” Hemant said.Congress chief Kharge claimed Hemant, a tribal, had paid the price for being a part of INDIA bloc.",Two empty chairs for jailed Arvind Kejriwal and Hemant Soren headlined INDIA bloc’s bid to turn the tables on BJP at a joint rally here today.

"Powered by brand PM Modi and RLD tie-up, Hema Malini in lead role again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/powered-by-brand-pm-modi-and-rld-tie-up-hema-malini-in-lead-role-again/articleshow/109485295.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two folk artistes sing with ear-splitting gusto, exalting

PM Modi

’s development work. The sparse audience listens with bored indifference, until the duo belts out a bardic dare to Pakistan.

A spontaneous cheer breaks out. The singers are support acts. At

Rampur Chauraha

, all are waiting for actor-politician

Hema Malini

. The two-time

MP, aiming for a hat-trick, is two hours late.

The chauraha (crossroads), about 20km from

, is a collection of faceless stores and a capacious temple complex. Old men in turbans mill about. A bunch of young men attending coaching classes for aspiring cops in nearby Raya nagar panchayat have stopped to catch a glimpse.

They are first-time voters. Sholay is her only film they can name. Barring a few women in ghoonghat, it’s an all-male crowd.

Saffron and green – caps of two different colours reveal the freshly-crafted political alliance for the polls. Imprinted with the slogan ‘Bhaichara Zindabad’ (long live brotherhood), the green cap represents Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Last month the regional party, primarily based out of west Uttar Pradesh, tied up with BJP and became a cog in the NDA wheel.

RLD is contesting the Baghpat and Bijnor Lok Sabha seats, and backing BJP in other constituencies. “Feel free to wear either cap,” someone announces.

The temple town has been BJP’s pocket borough since 2014. The constituency’s five assembly seats (Chhata, Mant, Goverdhan, Mathura and Baldev) are with it. Hema pocketed 53% of votes in 2014 LS polls, rising to a staggering 61% five years later, although her victory margin dipped.

RLD had cornered 34% of the votes then. Simply put, BJP and RLD had polled a combined 95% votes for Mathura in 2019. In politics, one plus one does not always equal two, but with RLD and BJP joining forces, the Lotus is undeniably in pole position here.

Hema’s second-term Parliament attendance was a modest 50%, about 30% lower than the national average. Voters aren’t positive in their assessment either. Jat farmer Malkhan Singh bluntly says she has been missing in action.

But he also proffers, “I will vote for her. Who else can one vote for?” For him, the competition is absent. Neither he, nor others sitting with him, have heard of Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar, also backed by Samajwadi Party and AAP, in the INDIA alliance.

Dhangar, 36, is an MBA in HR and marketing from Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow. “Yeh chunav pravasi aur Brijwasi ke beech ka chunav hoga (the contest is between Brijwasi (local) and the outsider,” he told ANI earlier this month.

Suresh Singh, 65, is the BSP candidate. Mathura’s SC population is roughly 20%. Jats, Thakurs and Brahmins are also numerically significant in these parts. Incidentally, the BJP candidate is married to film star Dharmendra, a Jat and former BJP MP from Bikaner, which increases her acceptability.

Every slogan on view is woven around Modi, “Main hoon Modi ka parivar” and “Phir ek baar Modi Sarkar” being the most familiar.

Talking to prospective voters, it isn’t hard to fathom why. Brand PM is the most saleable. Virendra Singh, who runs a medicine shop, laments the absence of electricity in his village Tambaka. “Kat-ti zyaada hai, aati kam hai. (there’s more load shedding than light),” says Virendra, a Prajapati by caste. But he likes Modi and will vote for him because he can reach out to the PM directly online and make complaints or suggestions on his website.

Virendra had received a WhatsApp message from ‘Viksit Bharat Sampark’, asking him, “What’s your opinion of the Modi government’s work?”. ‘Bahut achha (very good)’ or ‘theek thak (okay)’ or ‘kharab (poor)’. He answered, ‘bahut achha’, and received a ‘thank you’ message.

Bachchu Singh, a Jat working in a Delhi factory, is annoyed that his specially-abled wife’s application for awas yojna (housing plan) was rejected.

But he says he likes Modi’s work and will vote for BJP. He can’t explain why. Sukhwinder Singh of Bansai village complains reservoir water doesn’t flow to the fields anymore and his pleas aren’t heard. “But I’ll always be a BJP voter,” says the 34-year-old. Sometimes voting preference and disappointment with governance seem delinked.

The singing stops. Hema arrives in a grey MG Hector. After receiving the obligatory mementos, she sits in a sofa with a demeanour that says, “I would rather be elsewhere,” while local BJP and RLD politicians praise her work, especially expansion and improvement of local roads.

In Feb, former PM and the tallest of Jat leaders, Charan Singh – also the grandfather of Jayant Chaudhary who runs RLD – was posthumously bestowed Bharat Ratna by the Modi government. The gesture has presented both sides with an electorally saleable emotional hook.

Reading out mostly from a prepared speech, Hema underlines that the former PM deserved Bharat Ratna, which the earlier government had failed to confer.

As earlier, the Bharat Ratna reference draws full-throated approval. She speaks about her devotion to Lord Krishna, whose birthplace is Mathura. “Isiliye main yahan baithi hoon (that’s why I am here),” she says while avoiding any reference to the ongoing Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah case, currently in Allahabad high court. The speech lasts barely 12 minutes. The entourage drives away to slogans shouted in the actor-politician’s praise.

There are more meetings to attend, voters to woo.","The temple town of Rampur Chauraha has been BJP's pocket borough since 2014.

Will ‘imported’ sugar barons sweeten BJP’s Maharashtra tally?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-imported-sugar-barons-sweeten-bjps-maharashtra-tally/articleshow/109485400.cms,"Steady gains in state’s west

Growing disconnect with farmers

Political chameleons all

Nothing sweetens a politician’s chances in Maharashtra like sugar. Former CMs Vasantdada Patil, S B Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan were all sugar barons . So were the bulk of cabinet ministers .For a long time, the state’s cooperative sugar sector, which dominates the rural economy in western Maharashtra and parts of Marathwada, leaned towards Congress and NCP.The late Gopinath Munde was one of the few BJP leaders to set up sugar factories in Marathwada, until the party went on a drive to mop up sugar barons from rival camps in 2019.Among the top ‘imports’ were former Congress leaders Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Harshavardhan Patil, as well as the family of Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, who is now on his way back to NCP (Sharad Pawar). Vikhe Patil’s son Sujay is a BJP MP while Mohite Patil’s son Ranjitsinh is a BJP MLC. Later entrants include Hasan Mushrif, who joined Ajit Pawar’s faction of NCP, and Ashok Chavan, who left Congress for BJP.Centre also set up a Union Cooperation ministry under Amit Shah in 2021 although cooperatives are a state subject. But will these imports help BJP in Lok Sabha polls?Consider the numbers. The cooperative network has an influence on at least 16 of Maharashtra’s 48 Lok Sabha seats. Western Maharashtra’s sugar bowl has 10 of these. In 2009, Congress-NCP won six seats, but in the Modi wave of 2014, BJP won three and its alliance partner Shiv Sena won two, while NCP took four. By 2019, BJP had four seats, Shiv Sena three and NCP was down to three.However, observers say this sugar high has its limits. “There is now a disconnect between sugar barons who have gained financially and politically, and farmers who are the voters,” says Ajit Navale from Kisan Sabha.For the farmer-voter, the sugar export ban that caused domestic prices to slide, and low prices for the local soya bean crop are more impor tant, says farmer leader Raju Shetti, who rose politically by taking on sugar barons. He is contesting as an Independent candidate from Hat kanangale in the sugar belt.Shetti says BJP might also have to worry about the fallout from splitting NCP and Shiv Sena, and the Maratha quota agitation: “The sympathy wave towards Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray will also be a factor in this election, especially in western Maharashtra.”Maharashtra is India’s second biggest sugar producer after UP, and many of its cooperative sugar factories were set up in the 1960s. These spawned a larger web of cooperative banks, dairies and educational institutions, giving their masters enormous political clout.However, the influence of sugar barons over farmers waned as the feeling that they were self-serving and had run cooperative institutions to the ground grew. Several cooperative sugar factories were auctioned at throwaway prices, often to be run by the same politicians. Currently, there are more private sugar mills (105) than cooperatives (95) in the state.For all their political and financial clout, these barons have been ideologically fluid, siding with the winning side. Both Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Harshavardhan Patil left Congress and joined Shiv Sena-BJP govt in 1995. They later returned to Congress but are with BJP now.Originally with NCP, Vijaysinh Mohite Patil’s family aligned with BJP in 2019 and Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil became a party MLC. The family was expecting a BJP ticket for Vijaysinh’s nephew Dhairyasheel Mohite Patil, but after BJP nominated the family’s local rival and sitting MP Ranjeetsinh Nimbalkar from Madha, Dhairyasheel joined NCP (Sharad Pawar) and got the party’s Madha ticket.","Former CMs Vasantdada Patil, S B Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan were all sugar barons.

Kumbhani couldn't be reached for comments.

Surat collector and district election officer Sourabh Pardhi also disallowed the nomination of Kumbhani's dummy candidate

""I asked them if they were under any threat or pressure. They denied.""

BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal's election agent Dinesh Jodhani pointed out the irregularities Saturday. Three of Kumbhani's proposers - Ramesh Balchand Polra, Jagdish Savaliya and Dhruvin Dhameliya - submitted affidavits claiming that the signatures on his forms were not theirs. In Padsala's case, proposer Vishal Koladiya denied signing his form.

Congress lawyer Babu Mangukiya alleged a one-sided decision, saying they were not allowed to cross-examine the proposers.

Bloodlines & ballots: Saga of family legacies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bloodlines-ballots-saga-of-family-legacies/articleshow/109493505.cms,"In Gujarat’s political tapestry, “winnability” is a guiding principle for parties when selecting candidates for electoral battles. Yet, specific parliamentary constituencies in the state harbour a familial legacy, where multiple members of the same family have vied for office over time.Take the Amreli Lok Sabha constituency in Saurashtra, for example.It is perhaps the only seat in the country where parents and their daughter have contested elections. Virji Thummar, a stalwart of Congress, previously represented the seat, while his wife Nila contested and lost. Now, their daughter Jenny Thummar steps into the fray as the Congress candidate for the upcoming May 7 election. Despite her familial ties to the seat, Jenny asserts her independent journey in politics. “I have not been given the LS ticket because of my parents.I have been active in the party organization since 2015,” she said. The only child, Jenny returned from London after completing her MBA and took the plunge into politics. She was a member of the Amreli district panchayat before becoming its president. She worked in the state Youth Con gress unit and is presently the president of the state Mahila Morcha. The party has also named her an observer in Rajasthan for this election.Similarly, in the Sabarkantha Lok Sabha seat, familial connections run deep. The Congress has fielded Tushar Chaudhary, the sitting MLA from Khedbrahma constituency, as its candidate. The former Union minister is the son of former CM Amarsinh Chaudhary. Notably, his mother, Nisha Chaudhary, had represented the constituency thrice in the 1990s.The Anand Lok Sabha constituency in central Gujarat also carries a rich legacy. Represented five times by Congress leader Ishwar Chavda between 1980 and 1998, the constituency witnessed a familial continuum with the subsequent candidature of Madhavsinh Solanki’s son, Bharatsinh. Ishwar was the father-in-law of Madhavsinh, a former Gujarat CM and Union minister. Bharatsinh contested from the seat four times, winning twice and losing twice.In the 2024 general election, the Congress has nominated Amit Chavda, the MLA from the Anklav assembly constituency and grandson of Ishwar Chavda, to uphold the family’s political legacy.Further, the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat bears the imprint of the erstwhile princely Baroda State’s royal lineage. Fatehsinghrao Gaekwad represented the seat four times. Ranjitsinh Gaekwad was elected MP from the seat twice, and Satyajitsinh Gaekwad was elected once from the Vadodara LS seat.","Jenny Thummar is the Congress candidate for the Amreli Lok Sabha constituency.

Congress

candidate

Vaibhav Gehlot

is leaving nothing to chance, thanks to the learnings from the defeat in 2019 elections. Not only has he been camping in hamlets and villages of Jalore before his nomination was announced, but he also walks the extra mile to squeeze in time from the hectic

campaign

Your father lost his first assembly

in 1977 and won Jodhpur Lok Sabha seat in 1980. Do you foresee a similar script for you?

Jalore has been a

stronghold since 2004. How hopeful you are of a change now?

BJP candidates are majorly banking on Modi’s charisma. Do you think this will work again?

What are your plans for the

of this constituency?

What are the prospects of Congress and INDIA alliance in this election?

schedule to attend wedding functions in the constituency.As Vaibhav strives to step out of his father’s shadow and establish himself on the big political stage, he shares his ideas and plans for the journey ahead with TOI. ExcerptsI think people’s sentiments are now against Modiji. I have been visiting the area for the past two months and have found that people have made up their mind in favour of the Congress party. Even in the assembly polls, Congress won 70 seats which means people were keen to see a Congress government. However, certain permutations and combinations did not work for us.In the past two decades no major projects have come up in the constituency. People are struggling to get drinking water. The constituency lacks basic social infrastructure. There is a clear undercurrent against BJP. I expect people to bless me and the Congress party. The result from Jalore is going to surprise BJP. I am confident of my victory with a big margin.I have been visiting Jalore, Sirohi and Sanchore for a long time. I have had meetings with the non-resident people of this region who are settled in different parts of the country. They all feel betrayed. I don’t think there is any Modi wave . At the end of the day people want basic things like drinking water, good roads, health facilities and better employment opportunities. BJP talks about Ram temple. I am also a Ram Bhakt like any other Hindu. But that does not solve basic problems.I have released a Vachan Patra which is made after discussions with people from several walks of life. I will work for an airstrip in Sirohi. This area desperately needs an airport. Religious tourism has a lot of potential in the region. I will get more food and milk processing units so that dairy farmers and others won’t have to go to Gujarat. We need cold storage facilities for milk. Through cooperative movements, dairy farmers would benefit. Also, rail connectivity would be made better. Drinking water has been an issue for this region and I will try to get it through resultoriented plans.I think people have suffered a lot from inflation. Agencies like Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have been misused. I think the country is going to vote for a change. BJP and the prime minister have forgotten the issues which brought them to power. They are not addressing the basic issues like unemployment, inflation, poor economic conditions.","Vaibhav Gehlot is leaving nothing to chance, thanks to the learnings from the defeat in 2019 elections.

But the hattrick man Devji Patel who the won the last elections on a trot was denied a ticket by BJP this time. Lumbaram Choudhary , a grassroots worker of BJP and RSS has been fielded against Congress candidate, son of ex-chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Vaibhav Gehlot .Vaibhav had unsuccessfully contested 2019 Lok Sabha election from Jodhpur against BJP’s Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.The Gehlot junior has been camping in Jalore before his name was ‘officially’ announced by the Congress, while Lumbaram has been activating his connections in the RSS to make a mark.Here too, like any other constituency, BJP’s candidate talks about Ram Mandir, Article 370 and Modiji. On the other hand, Vaibhav is offering promises of airport, job opportunities, development of Krishi Mandi and much more.The constituency has nearly 23 lakh voters.Dewasis, Malis and Rajpurohits play a decisive role in the victory. Congress has fielded Vaibhav to at least secure nearly 1.5 lakh of Mali and Dewasi votes which is believed to be divided between BJP and Congress since both parties have their community MLAs iin constituencies like Abu-Pindwara and Raniwara.Rajputs in the region have been loyal voters of BJP but there are doubts on their support this time. BJP’s apparent downsizing of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje has not gone down well among the Rajputs, say locals. There is resentment among the community.In his public rallies, Ashok Gehlot says he has handed over his son to them for their service. Himanshi Gehlot, wife of Vaibhav, is also campaigning in Mount Abu and is seen visiting various areas.‘Maine to yahin rasoi shuru kar di hai, main ab yahin rahoongi aap sabke saath (I have now started staying here),’ Himanshi tells people during her visits. Vaibhav is seen accepting all kinds of turbans and garlands by vis iting the interiors of Jalore Sirohi and Sanchore.Gehlot in his speeches reminds the public that they have been voting for BJP since 2004 and still their dreams of having an airport at Sirohi or Abu Road remain unfulfilled. He also raises the issues of drinking water and rail connectivity that have been ignored. “Now people will have to think if they want merely good speeches or actual work,” says Gehlot.“This region has been electing BJP since 2004 and in the past 20 years, BJP has done almost nothing. I think anti-incumbency will work in my favour,” claims Vaibhav.Choudhary on the other hand is no different from other BJP candidates and starts his speeches and interactions by showering praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the work he has done. ‘Hindustan chahata hai Modi jeetey aur Pakistan chahta hai Modi haare’ (People of India want Modi to win and Pakistan wants him to lose). He talks about how an average Hindu is elated to see Ram temple. He also eulogises PM Modi on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).During his speeches, he is silent on his vision for the constituency and urges people to vote for Modi. “Modiji is likely to come and address a public rally on April 21 at Bhinmal. His presence will certainly make the difference,” says Choudhary.A look at the results of the assembly elections held last year show that people in Jalore do not have clear loyalty for a single party. BJP and Congress won three assembly seats each and one was bagged by an independent candidate in the assembly constituents of the LS seat. “This is an election for the country. This election is important to bring a strong leader like PM Narendra Modi. Congress has no vision as they just want to keep Modiji away,” says Choudhary.Locals say that polling percentage will give a clear idea on who will win the seat. “If the non-resident people of this region will come and vote in large numbers, this would indicate a clear wave for Modji. If the percentage goes down below 65 %, anything can happen,” said Sumer Singh Rajpurohit a 65-yearold farmer of Golasan village.","Lumbaram Choudhary, a grassroots worker of BJP and RSS has been fielded against Congress candidate, son of ex-chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Vaibhav Gehlots.
