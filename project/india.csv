NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the nation from Jammu & Kashmir on the occasion of the 10th International Yoga Day .PM Modi said Yoga has been creating new records ever since India's proposal for International Yoga Day was passed in the United States in 2014.""We can feel the energy in Srinagar, that we gain through Yoga. I extend greetings to people of the country and people performing Yoga in every corner of the world on Yoga Day. International Yoga Day has completed a historic journey of 10 years. In 2014, I proposed International Yoga Day at the United Nations . This proposal by India was supported by 177 nations and this was a record in itself. Since then, Yoga Day has been creating new records,"" PM Modi said.Speaking about Charlotte Chopin, the Yoga teacher from France who was accorded Padma Shri, PM Modi also urged everyone to make Yoga part of their daily lives.""This year in India, a 101-year-old woman Yoga teacher from France was accorded the Padma Shri.

It incorporates various postures (asanas), meditation techniques, and breathing exercises (pranayama) to promote overall well-being and harmony.The idea of observing International Yoga Day was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2014. The PM suggested June 21 as the date for the observance as it is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.The proposal received overwhelming support and response from the UN member states, which resulted in the adoption of a resolution on December 11, 2014, announcing June 21 as International Yoga Day. This resolution was co-sponsored by a record 177 countries, highlighting the worldwide recognition and acceptance of yoga as a beneficial practice.",PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation from Jammu & Kashmir on the occasion of the 10th International Yoga Day.

While 20 deaths were reported from central govt hospitals, 12 were recorded in Delhi govt facilities. This takes the heat toll in Delhi to at least 70, most occurring in the last two weeks. The number is likely to be higher as data from several hospitals isn't readily available.Safdarjung hospital has witnessed a surge in heat-related deaths , with 13 fatalities reported since Wednesday. This brings the total count in the hospital to 24, including two cases reported by TOI on Wednesday and five earlier casualties which have now been confirmed as heatstroke deaths after postmortem.Safdarjung authorities said 47 patients were currently admitted and of these 29 were critical with ailments related to heat. The influx of patients continues, hospital sources said, underlining the risk to public health from the unrelenting spell of heat.To cope with the growing crisis, the hospital has raised the number of beds for such patients from 13 to 23.Dr Ajay Chauhan from Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said that RML admitted 73 heatstroke patients since May 27, with 26 of them in the past 24 hours. ""Till date, 18 people have died due to heatstroke, seven in the last 24 hours."" The hospital currently has 32 such patients, 26 of whom are on ventilator support . The high number of patients on ventilators highlights the severity of the heatstroke cases, the doctor said.Out of 25 patients suffering from heat-related ailments at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, eight have died.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, told TOI that four people had died of heat-related ailments in the past 24 hour","Safdarjung hospital has witnessed a surge in heat-related deaths, with 13 fatalities reported since Wednesday.

Longest & severest spell of heat in at least 74 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/longest-severest-spell-of-heat-in-at-least-74-years/articleshow/111153275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Starting May 13, Delhi's main weather station Safdarjung has logged temperatures of 40 degrees C and more every single day. That's 39 days and counting, making this the longest spell of high heat in the capital in records of the past 74 years. It is also the severest heat spell in these years, with day and night temperatures among the highest ever recorded and as many as seven days when the mercury crossed 45 degrees.TOI analysed IMD 's daily temperature logs at Safdarjung since 1951 and found that the longest streak of 40+ temperatures prior to 2024 was 32 days, recorded from May 9 to June 10, 1978 (including both days), followed by 27 days in 1984 (from May 13 to June 8), which can be extended to 34 days if a single day of below 40 degrees C temperature is disregarded. Another notable streak of extreme heat was in 1998, which extended to 27 days with a single day of below 40-degree C temperature.As per these records, not only has the current heat spell extended far beyond any other in the past, Delhiites have also had to endure more temperature extremes than during any other spell. Day temperatures hit a peak of 46.8 degrees Celsius on May 29, the second highest maximum ever recorded at Safdarjung, next to only 47.2 degrees C logged on May 29, 1944. The only other long heat spell where the highest maximum came close was the one in 1998, when temperatures peaked at 46.5 degrees Celsius.No other spell had as many as seven days when the maximum was 45 degrees Celsius or higher. Again, the 1998 spell was a distant second with four such days.There have been as many as 12 heatwave days during the current spell, five in May and seven so far in June. This data is also likely to be highest although strict comparisons could not be made because the normal temperatures in the previous periods weren't available. As per IMD's categorisation, a heatwave day is when the maximum temperature is either 45 degrees C or more, or when it is more than 40 degrees Celsius and at least 4.5 degrees Celsius higher than normal.Besides, the current streak has had six straight days of 'warm night' conditions (when the maximum is over 40 degrees Celsius and the minimum is at least 4.5 notches above normal). The highest maximum temperature was recorded at 35.2 degrees on June 19, the highest minimum in the capital since 1964.So what led to this unprecedentedly long and severe spell of heat in the region this year? Said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, ""Three-four factors combined to make it a summer of extremes this year. First, this is the year after an El Nino event, when summers are usually harsh in India. Second, there were no western disturbances impacting northern India from mid-May till June 18. This meant there was no rainfall for over a month in the region, leading to an accumulation of heat which was exacerbated by the presence of anti-cyclonic circulations. Third, the monsoon went into a lull. It has started moving again but hasn't entered northwest India yet. These factors together led to the temperature extremes during the past month or so.""","Starting May 13, Delhi's main weather station Safdarjung has logged temperatures of 40 degrees C and more every single day. This is the longest spell of high heat in the capital in records of the past 74 years. It is also the severest heat spell in these years, with day and night temperatures among the highest ever recorded.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111153548,imgsize-1299786,width-400,resizemode-4/111153548.jpg"
"Kejriwal gets bail in excise case, ED to move HC today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-gets-bail-in-excise-case-ed-to-move-hc-today/articleshow/111153233.cms,"ED presuming and speculating: CM to court

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , who was arrested in March this year in a money laundering case related to implementation of Delhi excise policy of 2021-22. Special judge Niyay Bindu passed the order after hearing submissions of Kejriwal and Enforcement Directorate over two days.Kejriwal will be out of Tihar Jail on Friday after paying a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh. The court, however, imposed some conditions, including that he will not try to hamper the investigation or influence witnesses. After the order was pronounced around 7.56pm, ED requested the court to defer signing of the bail bond by 48 hours so that the order may be challenged before the appellate court. However, the court rejected the plea and asked for production of the bail bond before the duty judge on Friday. ED will be filing an appeal in HC on Friday. Kejriwal had been arrested by ED on March 21.A day earlier, his counsel, Vikram Chaudhri, had told the court that the case against him was based entirely on the statements of people who were not only tainted but had also been arrested and subsequently promised bail for supporting ED’s case. He had also argued that there was no corroborative evidence that Rs 100 crore was paid to AAP functionaries by the so-called ‘South Group’ and that there was no “camera recording or money as such which has been exchanged”.During the hearing on Thursday, additional solicitor general (ASG) S V Raju, who was appearing for ED, told the court that the agency was not conducting an investigation in the air but possessed concrete evidence. He said photos of currency notes produced in court were part of the money given as kickbacks and related to Kejriwal's stay at a seven-star hotel in Goa.“Instructions were received from one Vinod Chauhan to make payments to Chanpreet Singh and others. The pictures have been found on the phone of Chauhan. Chanpreet was speaking regularly to him on phone… Chauhan has good relations with Arvind Kejriwal,” claimed Raju.Chauhan, accused in the case, has been alleged to be handling the proceeds of crimes connected with hawala operators and managing postings in Delhi Jal Board through Kejriwal. ED has said he was the one responsible for the transfer of Rs 25.5 crore from Delhi to Goa.Chanpreet Singh, according to ED, was AAP’s fund manager for the Goa elections. He has been accused of collecting the proceeds of crime from Chauhan and being responsible for generation/acquisition/use of the alleged proceeds of crime, an amount of Rs 45 crore.Citing the refusal of the Delhi CM to reveal the password of his phone, ED told the court on Thursday: “Kejriwal says my phone is sacrosanct. Mai password nahi doonga. (I will not give my password)… An adverse inference has to be drawn from the fact that Kejriwal has refused to give his password. A lot of skeletons will come out if he gives his phone. This is a ground for refusing bail under ordinary bail law, forget section 45 PMLA for the time being.”Arguing that Kejriwal was liable to be prosecuted under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) even if he was not personally involved in any offence, Raju said: “You may not have committed the offence but you are responsible for the affairs of AAP, and if AAP is guilty of an offence, then you are guilty of it as well.”Turning to co-accused Vijay Nair, ASG said he was unconnected with the government and had no business framing the excise policy. He alleged that Nair was used as a middleman by Kejriwal.Referring to ED’s summons to CM, the ASG said there was willful disobedience of the summons by Kejriwal and the magistrate had taken cognisance of that and summoned him. Further, ED pointed out that a division bench of Delhi HC did not grant Kejriwal relief after he was arrested by ED.Responding to ED’s claims, Kejriwal’s counsel Chaudhri questioned the timing of Kejriwal’s arrest. Why did you not arrest him earlier? Why March 21? What did you want from him? Is ED an independent agency or is it playing in the hands of some political masters? said Chaudhri.","Arvind Kejriwal will be out of Tihar Jail on Friday after paying a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh.

Probe into Uttarakhand crash that killed 15 reveals driving test fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-into-uttarakhand-crash-that-killed-15-reveals-driving-test-fraud/articleshow/111152751.cms,"DEHRADUN: An inspection report submitted by the transport department 's lead agency has revealed that the Rudraprayag accident on June 15, which led to the death of 15 people, found that the online fee for the endorsement of mountainous routes on the driver's licence was deposited after the accident, suggesting that ""someone else completed the online test and fee submission on behalf of the driver"". The report further recommended reconsidering the implementation of the earlier system of physical examination of the driver to prevent such fraud. It was also found during the investigation that the driver was driving on mountain routes for the first time and was speeding.The report, still under consideration at the headquarters in Dehradun, further stated that the Tempo Traveller vehicle broke through five parapet blocks before falling 250 metres into the Alaknanda river . The vehicle took several turns and partially drowned in the river, with some passengers being thrown out onto the slope during the fall. The report added that the accident could have been less severe if connected crash barriers had been installed instead of parapet blocks.When contacted, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) Rudraprayag, Pramod Karnatak, said, ""The issue of licence fees has come up and it is being probed. The time at which the licence fee was submitted is also being looked into.""Another official, requesting anonymity, confirmed to TOI that the crash barriers installed there were not connected with each other.Significantly, the govt had ordered a magisterial enquiry into the accident, which has been the worst this summer.The officials involved in the report noted that the road from Rishikesh to Rudraprayag, constructed under the All-Weather Char Dham Road project, was currently ""in good condition with a speed limit of 30-km per hour."" However, most vehicles were observed to be over-speeding, putting lives at risk.The report further suggested installing rumble strips, white markings and other measures to restrict the speed limit at accident-prone spots.The condition of the accident site indicated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle, likely due to speeding and sleep deprivation, as he had been driving continuously for over 11 hours.It also highlighted the need to improve parking arrangements in Shivpuri, Devprayag, Dhari Devi temple and Brahmapuri to reduce traffic jams caused by roadside parking. Drivers often overspeed after passing through traffic to compensate for lost time, increasing the risk of accidents on the roads ahead.Joint transport commissioner Sanat Kumar Singh said the department would ""consider all the points to improve the situation and act accordingly.""",The online fee for the endorsement of mountainous routes on the driver's licence was deposited after the accident.

India stresses on border peace as China pushes for resumption of direct flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stresses-on-border-peace-as-china-pushes-for-resumption-of-direct-flights/articleshow/111145324.cms,"NEW DELHI: China is pushing India to restart direct passenger flights after a four-year hiatus, though India remains hesitant due to ongoing tensions over a border dispute.The diplomatic strain stems from a major military confrontation in June 2020 that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers. Thousands of troops from both nations are still deployed along their shared border.Since the clash, India has restricted Chinese investments, banned numerous popular apps, and halted passenger flights between the two countries, although cargo flights continue to operate. While both economies stand to gain from resuming direct flights, the stakes are particularly high for China, where recovery in international travel post-COVID-19 has been sluggish, in contrast to India's booming aviation sector.Over the past year, China's government and airlines have approached India's civil aviation authorities several times to restore direct air links.""We hope the Indian side will work with China in the same direction for the early resumption of direct flights,"" China's Foreign Ministry told Reuters last week, highlighting that resuming flights would benefit both countries.However, a senior Indian official responded, ""Unless there is peace and tranquillity on the border, the rest of the relationship cannot move forward.""Indian airlines, including Indigo, and Chinese carriers are discussing with their respective governments the feasibility of resuming direct routes. ""When the time is right and the governments come to a mutual understanding of how to move forward, we'll assess the market,"" said Pieter Elbers, CEO of Indigo, India's largest airline.Direct flights between India and China hit a peak in December 2019, with 539 scheduled flights, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Chinese carriers accounted for 371 of those flights, while India's airlines scheduled 168.These flights were halted in early 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic escalated. Despite the resumption of international travel restrictions being lifted a year later in India and early 2023 in China, direct flights have not resumed, except for minimal Covid-19 repatriation flights. Travelers must now rely on connecting flights through hubs like Hong Kong , Dubai, or Singapore. This has extended travel time from less than six hours to upwards of 10 and diverted business—including lucrative through traffic to the United States—to carriers such as Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Cathay Pacific.Air India CEO Campbell Wilson added, ""Direct India-China flights 'would seem to be a huge potential market,' but for now there are factors at play 'beyond our level.'""","China is pushing India to restart direct passenger flights after a four-year hiatus.

The delegation's visit to Dharamshala drew China's ire, with Beijing urging the Americans to fully recognise the ""anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group"", honour commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Tibet, and stop sending a wrong signal to the world.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal gets bail in excise policy case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arvind-kejriwal-gets-bail-in-excise-policy-case/articleshow/111144956.cms,"'Truth can be troubled, not defeated'

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Thursday granted bail to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on a bond of Rs 1 lakh in the money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy case. The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.Kejriwal has been in jail since March 21 and was granted bail for a short period to campaign for his party during the Lok Sabha elections held last month.The court, however, imposed conditions on the bail, including prohibiting him from hampering the investigation or influencing witnesses. Kejriwal has been instructed to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation.Special Judge Niyay Bindu issued the order after listening to arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsel. On Wednesday, Kejriwal's judicial custody had been extended until July 3.The judge had reserved the order earlier in the day after hearing arguments from the ED, which sought to link Kejriwal to the alleged proceeds of crime and co-accused individuals. The defense argued that the prosecution lacked evidence to substantiate claims against the AAP leader.ED will now move Delhi high court on Friday morning against trial court's judgement in Arvind Kejriwal case.AAP leader Atishi commented ""Satyamev Jayate"" (truth alone triumphs) following the grant of bail.Kejriwal's arrest stemmed from allegations tied to financial irregularities in the excise policy, which led to a high-profile investigation by the ED. The case has drawn significant attention and sparked numerous political reactions.""We have faith in the court… Kejriwal gets bail… truth wins…,"" Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann wrote on X.""Truth can be troubled, but not defeated,"" said AAP.Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said, ""Rouse Avenue court granting bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal is a milestone for the whole country. This decision will become a big example in our law system. In PMLA, most people get relief only from the Supreme Court. Usually, lower courts never give relief. So it is evident that the central govt has no proof in this case.""AAP national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""This case is completely fake, the whole case has been written in the BJP office. We are very grateful to the court for giving a historic decision. Regular bail in a PMLA case is nothing less than an acquittal.""",The court also declined Enforcement Directorate (ED) prayer to stay the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's bail order for 48 hours.

"HC orders retiral benefits after 26 yrs, but staffer & wife dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hc-orders-retiral-benefits-after-26-yrs-but-staffer-wife-dead/articleshow/111148199.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Quarter of a century after an employee of Haryana electricity department sought legal help for grant of pensionary benefits , neither he nor his wife are alive to enjoy the benefits granted to him after intervention of the Punjab and Haryana high court .Shri Niwas, an employee of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (earlier known as Haryana State Electricity Board) had filed a petition in the high court in 1998 and sought directions to the Haryana government to grant him pensionary benefits after his retirement.The Haryana government made a statement in the high court that benefits have been granted in his case. The case was disposed of by the HC in view of the Haryana statement that benefits have been granted, but It is not clear whether the benefits have been issued to the legal heirs , if any, or have only been granted on paper. On May 22, the counsel representing Shri Niwas told the HC that the petitioner and his wife have passed away.However, his case has led the high court to issue directions to the Haryana chief secretary to compile a list of all such cases from all the government departments so that they can be decided expeditiously.With regard to the cases which are admitted in the court and old cases in which even paper-books are not available with the organisations/state public sector undertakings, the HC has granted liberty to all the public sector undertakings/state organisations to seek a copy of the paper-book from the registry of the high court by routing their applications through the office of the Haryana advocate general.As per available information, Haryana has identified 31 cases ofstatutory corporations and two cases of statutory boards wherein employees are waiting for their pensionary benefits for a long time. The Haryana government has also issued instructions to all the statutory boards and corporations to evaluate all such pending cases.The HC has asked Haryana to file a compliance report after two months ""on the larger issue"" with regard to action taken on such other cases. Niwas's case for grant of pensionary benefits was not cleared for one reason or the other in spite of the fact that no inquiry or disciplinary proceedings were pending against him. There was some dispute regarding his promotion and that is why the board stopped his retiral benefits . A letter was issued by the department on August 28, 1998 stating that the petitioner was ordered to be retired as head clerk and not as circle superintendent.His pensionary benefits were withheld on the ground that now the pay of the petitioner would be fixed as head clerk and his pensionary benefits would be calculated after that. His plea was that since till the date of retirement he worked as circle superintendent, the pay of that period could not be denied to him as he actually worked on that post.After being deprived of his retiral benefits, he approached the government with a request that whatever pensionary benefits he is entitled to as per calculation made by his office should be released so that he is able to carry on with responsibilities towards his family.Even this request was ignored and no action whatsoever was taken, after which he approached the HC asking, ""whether pensionary benefits of an employee can be withheld for no rhyme and reason.","Shri Niwas, an employee of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited, had filed a petition in the high court in 1998 and sought directions to grant him pensionary benefits after his retirement.

Your bargain buys might just get confiscated - or even destroyed - by US customs officials .With US Customs and Border Protection (CPB) stepping up its surveillance of smuggling of counterfeit goods , many Indian students and travellers who flew into America in recent months had their fake luxury items seized at the port of entry.Some told TOI they had to watch the staff run scissors through their clothes or ditch them in the trash can.CPB rules say an individual can carry one counterfeit item of each type (like one shirt, handbag, or pair of shoes) provided it is for personal use and not for sale. Anything in ""excess"" of this is banned.I travelled to the US to meet my son, who is pursuing a master's in supply chain management in Texas. I was carrying eight shirts, four trousers, some socks, and a pair of shoes. All the goods were still packed as I had just bought them, said a schoolteacher from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.""At the port of entry officials checked my bags and bombarded me with questions about where I was travelling from, who the goods were for, if I was smuggling them, etc. Though I tried explaining to them that it was all for my son, they insisted that I could not take them as they were all counterfeit goods - copies of big brands - which I wasn't aware of. Since they threatened me with criminal charges, I had no choice but to let them seize everything immediately.""The traveller said many of the clothing items were torn before being discarded. ""I lost goods worth at least Rs 30,000,"" added the 43-year-old, appealing to authorities to mention these rules on relevant platforms for the benefit of travellers.""How do we know this (rule) if it is not prominently mentioned in the dos and don'ts guide that gives travellers a checklist of what can be carried and what can't,"" asked a 27-year-old student from Hyderabad who had a similar experience a few months ago.""It is very common in India for people to sell and buy copies of big brands.I had no idea that carrying them in my luggage is such a serious offence."" The student, pursuing a master's in business management and economics from California, had eight to 10 shirts, pants, and three pairs of shoes thrown into the trash by customs officials.When TOI reached out to the CPB, officials said that scrutiny had increased after 23 million counterfeit goods from 19,724 shipments were seized in 2023. ""This violates Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). If these goods were genuine or sold illegally with actual brand names, it would have amounted to $2.7 billion,"" a department representative said, adding that such fake goods threaten economic vitality, national security and public safety. ""Bringing them into the United States may result in civil or criminal penalties and purchasing counterfeit goods often supports criminal activities, such as forced labour or human trafficking.""","Indian students and travellers who flew into America in recent months had their fake luxury items seized at the port of entry.

Ajay Rai

is elated over INDIA bloc’s performance in the state. He himself put up a brave front while contesting against

Prime Minister Narendra Modi

in Varanasi where the PM’s victory margin substantially dipped from 4.79 lakh in 2019 to 1.52 lakh votes against Rai this time. In conversation with

Shailvee Sharda





What are the key takeaways from the Lok Sabha election?





How do you see your party’s performance in UP?





Constitution or caste – which was been the bigger force that acted as a multiplier for INDIA bloc?





Different surveys have come up indicating that Dalits have voted for the INDIA bloc. Do you agree?





What worked in favour of the Congress?





Why do you say that Ram and ration did not resonate with voters?





SP-Congress alliance has worked well so far. What next?





Rahul Gandhi has said that Priyanka could have defeated PM Modi from Varanasi. Your take?





Do you think you could have done better in Varanasi?

, Rai said that people rejected the politics of polarisation and voted for the country. Excerpts:Lok Sabha elections proved that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not invincible, and that people of India hold the supreme power. It has been established that those who cannot ensure public interest and welfare will get a thumbs down from voters. People have rejected the politics of hatred and foiled all efforts of the BJP to polarize elections. It appears people resorted to strategic voting in many seats and voted for the nation.We did well. Winning six out of 17 seats is a good strike rate but the number could have been higher. We have been made to lose on certain seats. Bansgaon is an example where a candidate lost by a margin of 3,150 votes. Similarly, in Deoria, Maharajganj, Kanpur and Amroha our candidates did well in many rounds, but the BJP candidate took the lead in the final round. Had the elections been fair, the Congress tally would have been 10. Despite this, we have gained as the hard work put in by the party since 2019 to strengthen the organization has finally paid dividends. The results have energized our cadre.Constitution, for sure. People from all walks of life – SC, ST, Dalits, Muslims, OBCs, women and youth – supported the cause. The Constitution is the core of our existence as an Indian. People feared that the Modi govt would change the Constitution and the anxiety deepened when BJP candidates, MPs, MLAs reiterated this to polarize the election. INDIA bloc and Rahul Gandhi offered hope to the people and their faith shaped the election outcome.Not just Dalits, people across caste lines have reposed faith in us. In Varanasi, Sonkars – who are said to be the traditional vote bank of BJP – have voted for me. Pasis and Kurmis voted for us in various constituencies. The economy has been affected by BJP’s faulty policies. Instead of taking remedial measures, BJP distracted people.BJP workers and committed RSS cadre did not venture out to campaign as they did not want to face the people. I think the workers had been failed by the leadership. Promises were not fulfilled, jobs were not created, and the people’s problems were not solved. In Varanasi, workers were sidelined, and all work was carried out by event management companies which relied on hired workforce.Hindus are religious and hold a personal bond with their deity. Both PM Modi and the BJP commercialized faith. The ration given by the BJP may have been a good act, but they started taking credit for it and used it to bargain for votes. This hurt the self-respect of the people.We will continue to work together. The leadership would devise a strategy for upcoming byelections and the future course of action.Absolutely true.

The journalist, Sebastien Farcis, had been reporting for several radio stations in France and Belgium since 2011 and is married to an Indian national.Farcis is the second French journalist to be allegedly forced out in four months, after Vanessa Dougnac , the longest serving foreign correspondent in India, in Feb. Another foreign journalist and ABC reporter, Avani Dias, too had left in April claiming the Indian govt had made it difficult for her to continue working here.Following that development, 30 foreign journalists had written to the govt asking it to facilitate the vital work of a free press in line with India's democratic traditions.Farcis said in a post on X the home ministry did not renew his journalist permit in March this year, preventing him from doing his work and denying him his source of income. No reason was given for this work ban, said the journalist who holds OCI status because of his marriage.""I have been working as a journalist in India since 2011, and have obtained all the necessary visas and accreditations. I have respected the regulations imposed in India for foreign journalists and never worked in restricted or protected areas without a permit. On several occasions, MHA even granted me permits to report from border areas,"" said Farcis.""Therefore, this work ban comes as a big shock: it was communicated to me on the eve of the general elections, the largest democratic polls in the world, which I was hence forbidden to cover. This appeared to me as an incomprehensible censorship,"" he said.Farcis went on to say he's deeply attached to India, adding it had become his second homeland. ""But with no more work nor income, my family has been pushed out without explanation, and uprooted overnight for no apparent reason,"" he said, adding at least five OCI foreign journalists had been prevented from working here in the past two years.

Congress poses six questions as PM Modi visits J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-poses-six-questions-as-pm-modi-visits-jk/articleshow/111143629.cms,"Here are the questions posed by Congress

When will full statehood return to Jammu and Kashmir?



""Since 2018, the people of J&K have been denied any avenue to express their grievances. The region has become a bureaucratic fiefdom controlled by the BJP-RSS cabal. While claiming to have ended special status for J&K, the one-third Pradhan Mantri has in fact created an extra-special situation of a new and unique political system: one where the state has been downgraded to a UT, elections have been suspended, and all norms of constitutional morality violated. In his speech in Parliament on December 11, 2023, Home Minister Amit Shah said that full statehood to J&K would be restored at an “appropriate time”. Five years after being stripped of their statehood, the people of J&K still lack clarity on what the timeline for this return of statehood is. Can the one-third Pradhan Mantri give a straight answer to this key question: when will full statehood return to Jammu and Kashmir?"" Why is the BJP scared of elections in Jammu and Kashmir?



""The people of Jammu and Kashmir have been left without an elected government for the last six years. The last Vidhan Sabha elections were held in 2014 and four seats in the Rajya Sabha remain vacant because of the delay in holding assembly polls. The terms of 4,892 Panchayats and 316 Block Development Councils (2nd and 3rd tiers of Panchayati Raj) also came to an end on January 9, 2024. The blame for this suspension of democracy lies entirely with the Centre. As the Chief Election Commissioner clarified in March 2024, the one-third Pradhan Mantri’s Government failed to reconcile its own J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 with its own Delimitation Exercise, 2022 – preventing the ECI from initiating the electoral process. This weaponized incompetence appears to be deliberate: unable to win power through legitimate electoral means, the BJP has used this opportunity to control the levers of power for selfish gains. Several allegations had been made by various stakeholders within J&K that Government-awarded contracts are being given to a chosen few, in a well thought out policy of discrimination against locals. It is only the Supreme Court-imposed deadline of September 2024 that has forced the Center to conduct the polls now. Can the one-third explain this long delay in holding the elections? Why has he clung so desperately to power in a state where the people never chose to be led by him?"" Why has the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir deteriorated under your watch?



""The one-third Pradhan Mantri claims to have curbed terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir at all his public meetings. The mood on the ground in J&K, however, is one of anxiety. Since January 1st 2023, 35 of our brave security personnel and eight innocent civilians have lost their lives in the Pir Panjal Range (comprising the Rajouri-Poonch area) alone, in an area where there were no major incidents of terrorism between 2007 and 2014. In the last few weeks, it has spread even to neighboring districts that we considered largely peaceful: as evinced by the attack in Reasi on the 9th of June, the attack in Kathua on the 10th of June, and in Doda on the 11th of June. Infiltration from Pakistan is rising along the International Border, and a palpable sense of insecurity prevails across J&K. The one-third Pradhan Mantri, who has been busy accepting congratulatory messages, including from Pakistani PM, has been conspicuously silent even amidst this surge in terrorism. Why has his Government has failed to salvage the security situation in J&K? What is his vision to restore normalcy?"" Why has the Government failed to support Kashmiri Pandits?



""The BJP has exploited the misery of the Kashmiri Pandits in every election campaign. However, ten years after coming to power, the one-third Pradhan Mantri and the Home Minister have done absolutely nothing for the community and have not even held a meeting with the community’s representatives. In consultation with the community, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s Government had devised a 6,000-job employment package for Kashmiri Pandit youth to take up jobs in Kashmir Valley. For all the bluster of the current Government, that remains the last major intervention by the Union Government to rehabilitate the Pandit community, even amidst a nationwide social and political consensus for the community’s Gharwapsi. Does the one-third Pradhan Mantri view the community only as a talking point? Why has he neglected their interests over the last decade?"" If the Union Government’s actions are popular, why do the BJP and its proxies keep getting rejected by the people of J&K?



When the BJP abrogated Article 370 to much fanfare in 2019, they repeatedly argued that the actions were popular among the people of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the one-third Pradhan Mantri refused to visit the J&K after 2019, until the Lok Sabha polls in 2024. The BJP refused to contest the Lok Sabha elections in the Kashmir Valley, instead implicitly supporting candidates put up by its proxies. However, all three proxies fared poorly, scoring a zero in the Lok Sabha and securing a lead only in one Vidhan Sabha segment. If the Union Government’s actions are popular, why do the BJP and its proxies keep getting rejected by the people of J&K?"" How much investment has Jammu and Kashmir actually garnered since 2019?



""When the BJP abrogated Article 370 to much fanfare in 2019, they repeatedly argued that the law was a hindrance to “development and progress”. In the three years since the new industrial policy was announced in January 2021, the Union Territory has received proposals worth 84,544 crore in as many as 42 industrial sectors. Till date, only 414 units have been registered and actual investment on the ground is just 2,518 crores. Although there was much optimism about the hospitality sector, only 87 crores of investment proposals have been received till now. Apart from J&K Bank, the only large-scale employer in J&K is the Chenab Textile Mills (CTM), which came to J&K in 1962, during Pandit Nehru’s tenure. After achieving quite little over the past decade, the one-third Pradhan Mantri is back in J&K to lay the foundation stone of projects worth 3,300 crores this time. But before he does so, can he answer: How many jobs has his Government created – in the public sector or in the private sector? How many investors from the rest of India have actually invested in J&K since 2019? How many PSUs has the Union Government set up in J&K? Can the one-third Prime Minister inaugurate a single facility that his Government has built in J&K?""

The other three requests seek checking of EVM chips across 26 select polling stations of Gajapathinagaram AC and Ongole AC in Andhra Pradesh and Jharsuguda AC in Odisha. The PCs with the most polling stations selected for EVM check are Ahmednagar PC (40); Virudhunagar PC and Zahirabad PC (20 each); Jharsuguda AC (13) and Ongole AC (12).Interestingly the verification was sought not only for the closely contested seats with thin victory margins but also where margins exceeded 2 lakh votes.

In Kanker PC, the narrow margin of 1,884 votes seems to have prompted defeated Congress candidate Biresh Thakur to seek EVM chip verification; as in Jharsuguda AC where the BJD candidate Dipali Das lost to BJP rival by 1,333 votes; and Virudhunagar PC where the Congress opponent defeated DMDK candidate by 4,379 votes.

Four occupants were taken to hospital but Bahadur and Prasad couldn't be saved.
