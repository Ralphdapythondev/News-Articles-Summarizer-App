"10 centres in Haryana, 8 in Kottayam score well above average in NEET-UG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-centres-in-haryana-8-in-kottayam-score-well-above-average-in-neet-ug/articleshow/111912756.cms,"Most ‘high-performing’ centres had just 3-4 students with 700+ scores

An initial analysis of data on city and centre-wise NEET-UG scores put out by National Testing Agency shows that there are 10 centres in Haryana and eight in Kerala where more than 5% of candidates scored over 650 (out of 720). That proportion is more than three times the national average of 1.3% students getting that score. Unlike in Kerala, where all such centres are in Kottayam , a well-known coaching hub, in Haryana they are from eight cities.Other than Rajasthan's Sikar, which grabbed headlines for the maximum number of centres with high proportion of 650-plus students, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Vijayawada and Malappuram had many centres where proportion of such students was well above national average.Several centres in Haryana also had a high proportion of those scoring over 600. But the clustering of scores above 700 was seen more in two centres in Gujarat, with nine students in one centre in Rajkot and another in Ahmedabad managing the feat.With the exception of these two centres in Gujarat, a majority of the ‘high performing’ centres had just three to four students at best who scored over 700.In many of the Haryana centres, the proportion of candidates who scored 600 was also much higher compared to many other centres. For instance, 22.7% of the students who appeared for the test at the Delhi Public School in Rewari scored more than 600. This was the highest proportion for any centre not just in Haryana, and would be among the highest for any state.Centres in Rewari, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Hisar, Bhiwani and Sirsa in Haryana outdid the centres in Gujarat, Delhi and Kerala when it came to having a high proportion of candidates who scored over 650 and 600.

In a significant escalation, Israeli fighter jets struck Houthi military targets near Yemen's Hodeidah port on Saturday, killing at least three people and wounding 87, a day after a drone launched by the Iranian-backed group hit Tel Aviv , Israel's economic hub.Most of the wounded suffered severe burns from the airstrikes that targeted oil facilities and a power station, according to Al-Masirah TV, the primary news outlet of Yemen's Houthi movement, which cited the health ministry.Hodeidah residents reported hearing explosions throughout the city during the intensive bombardment. Al-Masirah TV stated that civil defense forces and firefighters were attempting to extinguish fires in the port's oil tanks.The strikes, which triggered a raging fire and plumes of black smoke, are the first claimed by Israel in Yemen, marking a new phase in the conflict.The airstrikes targeted gas and oil depots and a power station in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, which is controlled by the Houthis and contains vital oil export facilities. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the port as a significant supply route for Iranian weapons to Yemen. However, the port is also crucial for humanitarian aid to Yemen, and the official acknowledged that some ""dual-use"" targets, serving both military and civilian purposes, were struck.The Israeli military confirmed its warplanes targeted ""military objectives of the Huthi terrorist regime"" in response to the drone attack in Tel Aviv, which breached Israel's air defenses.Israeli ""fighter jets struck military targets of the Huthi terrorist regime in the area of Hodeida port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the state of Israel in recent months,"" the military said, as reported by AFP.Despite the attack, the Israeli military indicated it was not tightening emergency civil defense regulations, suggesting officials do not expect a more serious escalation, NYT reported.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel will ""defend ourselves by all means"", hours after fighter jets struck a Huthi-controlled port in Yemen in retaliation for a deadly drone attack.""I have a message for Israel's enemies: Make no mistake. We will defend ourselves by all means, on all fronts. Anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression,"" he said in a televised address the day after a drone killed a civilian in Tel Aviv.Netanyahu also called on the international community to step up pressure on Tehran and its proxies - the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah - and in so doing help secure international trade routes.""Whoever wants to see a stable and safe Middle East needs to stand against Iran's axis of evil, and support Israel's struggle against Iran and its proxies,"" Netanyahu said.The Israeli bombardment caused a massive fire in the port area, likely from burning fuel.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant declared the retaliatory action, saying, ""The blood of Israeli citizens has a price."" Gallant warned of more operations against the Iran-backed Huthis if further attacks occur.""The fire burning in Hodeidah is seen across the Middle East, and the significance is clear,"" said Gallant. ""The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them — and we will do this in any place where it may be required,"" he added.Huthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam condemned the strikes, calling them a ""brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."" He claimed the attack targeted ""fuel storage facilities and a power plant"" to pressure Yemen to cease support for Palestinians in the Gaza conflict. The Huthi-run health ministry reported deaths and injuries but did not provide specific numbers.Al Masirah television, operated by the Huthis, aired footage of a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky. AFP also reported several large explosions were heard and smoke was seen over the port.The drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday, claimed by the Houthis, killed one Israeli and injured several others. This attack is part of a sustained Houthi campaign against Israel, involving hundreds of missiles and drones aimed at Israeli cities and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.Friday's deadly drone attack, which struck near a US diplomatic compound, breached Israel’s air defenses. Most previous Houthi-fired missiles and drones at Israel have been intercepted by US and Israeli forces.Until Saturday, Israel had refrained from a full-on attack against the Houthis in Yemen, located over 1,000 miles away. However, the Tel Aviv drone attack prompted a decisive response, with Israeli fighter jets flying toward Yemen by Saturday afternoon.The strikes have exacerbated fears about Yemen's already critical food security and humanitarian situation. Hodeida port, a crucial entry point for imports and international aid, has been a lifeline for millions of Yemenis suffering from over a decade of war.""This will likely be perceived by many Yemenis as an attack on their homeland, which could bolster Huthi recruitment and funding,"" said Mohammed Albasha, senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group. He added that traders fear the strikes will worsen the humanitarian crisis in northern Yemen, as most trade flows through this port.The Biden administration had not immediately reacted to Saturday's strike. However, following Friday's attack in Tel Aviv, Gen Charles Q. Brown Jr., chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said at the Aspen Security Forum that ""Israel has the right to defend itself.""UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had called for ""maximum restraint"" after the Tel Aviv drone strike to avoid further regional escalation. However, Huthi politburo member Mohammed al-Bukhaiti quickly threatened revenge for the Hodeida strikes. ""The Zionist entity will pay the price for targeting civilian facilities, and we will meet escalation with escalation,"" he posted on social media.The Huthis have previously claimed attacks on Israeli cities, including Ashdod, Haifa, and Eilat, but Friday's strike on Tel Aviv was the first to breach Israel's vaunted air defenses.","Israeli fighter jets strike Houthi military targets near Yemen's Hodeidah port, killing at least three people and wounding 87.

She was found staying under a fake identity in a homestay

(Inputs by Asseem Shaikh)

PUNE: Manorama Khedkar , mother of probationary IAS Puja Khedkar , was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.“She had hired a private cab to visit different places before moving into the home stay facility around 11 pm on Wednesday. She was staying there under a fictitious identity ‘Indubai Dhakane’. The cab driver, Dadasaheb Dhakane, showed his genuine Aadhaar card to the facility owner while Manorama showed the Aadhaar card of the cab driver’s mother to get the room booked,” said Pune Rural SP Pankaj Deshmukh.“Our team, which was tracking her movements, was alerted by a cellphone number which got activated while it was put on surveillance.The location of this cell phone was Hirkaniwadi and our team immediately reached there,” the SP said.Paud police in rural Pune on July 12 had registered the case after a video recently went viral on social media showing Manorama, accompanied by bouncers, brandishing a .25 Webley & Scott pistol on June 5, 2023, during an argument with some farmers over a land ownership issue at Dhadhawali village in Mulshi taluka. One of the farmers lodged a complaint.Manorama was produced before judicial magistrate first class Sudhir G Barde in Paud on Thursday afternoon and was remanded in police custody till July 20 after assistant public prosecutor Amar Nanaware told the court that the police have invoked an attempted murder charge against Manorama on the basis of a supplementary statement recorded by complainant Pandharinath Pasalkar.Pasalkar alleged in the complaint that Manorama reached the parcel of land in a four-wheeler and picked up an argument with him.“She abused and threatened me and other villagers when I told her to leave the place as the land dispute would be decided by the civil court where the matter is pending. However, she insisted that she had purchased the land and her name was in the 7/12 extract showing ownership,” the complainant stated.In the supplementary statement, Pasalkar alleged that Manorama put a pistol to his head and was about to pull the trigger when he sat down in a panic reaction and people accompanying her pulled her back.Nanaware submitted that Pasalkar had then filed a complaint application against Manorama and others with the Paud police but did not pursue the matter out of fear. Pasalkar approached the police after the video relating to the incident went viral on social media recently.Nanaware also submitted in court that the police needed Manorama’s custodial remand to recover her licensed pistol and establish the places she visited while on the run.Nanware also said that the police needed to arrest the other accused named in the FIR and seek details of the land dispute that led to the incident.Manohar Aukirkar, the owner of ‘Parvati Nivas,’ said, “Around 11pm on Wednesday, aman, who drove to our establishment in a car, approached me and said that he and his mother needed a room for an overnight stay. It was raining heavily then and since a woman was accompanying him, we took a humanitarian approach and gave them a room on the second floor of the facility.”Aukirkar said, “We checked the man’s Aadhaar card which carried the name Dadasaheb Dhakane and his photo. The man told us that his mother’s name was Indubai Dhakane. After recording their details, we gave him the room keys.”The video of Manorama brandishing the firearm surfaced after her daughter, probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar, was shunted to Washim from Pune for demanding facilities she was not entitled to get.Soon one thing after the other started tumbling out about the family, and questions were also raised about Puja’s OBC and disability certificates, which she had used to get IAS cadre despite asub-800 UPSC score.","Manorama Khedkar, mother of probationary IAS Puja Khed Kar, was arrested on Thursday from a homestay in Raigad district.

Paris Olympics: Why do Olympic winners bite their medals?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-why-do-olympics-winners-bite-their-medals/articleshow/111899271.cms,"NEW DELHI: Qualifying for the Olympics requires years of unwavering dedication, strenuous effort, and steadfast commitment, making it evident that earning a medal in an Olympic event is an extraordinary accomplishment. However, the reason behind Olympians' tendency to bite their medals while posing for photographs may not be immediately apparent.Historically, teeth have served purposes beyond mere eating, speaking, and smiling.In fact, people once employed their teeth to determine the genuineness of precious metals.Pure gold , silver , and copper are soft metals, allowing teeth marks to be left on objects containing them. It's possible to leave teeth marks in objects containing pure gold, silver, or copper because they are all soft metals.This biting technique was used to ascertain the authenticity of gold coins and other gold items. If teeth marks could not be left on the object being bitten, it might be concluded that the item was merely gold-plated, combined with other alloys, or contained no gold at all.The composition of present-day Olympic medals is well-known: gold medals primarily consist of sterling silver, while bronze medals are actually composed of copper. The composition of modern-day Olympic medals is no secret: gold medals are mostly comprised of sterling silver, while bronze metals are actually made of copper.The tradition of Olympians biting their medals has persisted over the years, not as a means of verifying the purity of precious metals, but simply as a more engaging and intriguing pose compared to merely smiling for the cameras.Furthermore, although they are not exerting significant force when biting their medals, this pose allows Olympians to showcase their apparent strength in an entertaining manner.","Historically, teeth have served purposes beyond mere eating, speaking, and smiling.

NEET-UG result below par at centres under lens: NTA data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/neet-ug-result-below-par-at-centres-under-lens-nta-data/articleshow/111892030.cms,"NEW DELHI: The state and centre-wise medical entrance test result data, made public by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Saturday, indicated that applicants who took the exams from centres which allegedly benefited from the paper leak and other irregularities have in reality not performed well.The NEET-UG 2024 data revealed that while the performance of candidates from centres under the scanner, like the Oasis School in Hazaribag (Jharkhand), and Hardayal Public School in Jhajjar (Haryana), or for that matter the Jay Jalaram International School in Godhra (Gujarat), were comparatively below par vis-a-vis not just the centres in coaching hubs but also thousands of others which have not attracted any taint for irregularities.This may appear significant in view of NTA's stand that the leak was a localised affair limited to Hazaribag, and with the beneficiaries already identified and debarred, there is no need for cancellation of the test.Supreme Court had on Thursday ordered the NTA to upload on its website by Saturday noon the centre-wise results of the examination taken by more than 23 lakh students competing for over 1 lakh MBBS seats. This was to identify candidates who benefited from the NEET-UG question paper leak in Bihar and determine the spread of the leakage.The court was responding to the contention of the petitioners' counsel, senior advocate Narender Hooda, that the veracity of NTA's stand which, he claimed, was at odds with the findings of Bihar Police which exposed the Hazaribag leak, should be ascertained by analysing the centre-wise results.There were 701 candidates from the centre in Oasis School, the epicenter of the alleged leak, but no one scored 700 or above, while the number in the cohort of 650-699 was 7, and there are another 12 aspirants in the mark-range of 600-649. Significantly, while less than 1% of the candidates scored 650 and above in Oasis School, the centre in St Xavier's School in the same city registered a little over 2% success rate for candidates scoring 650 and above, with one scoring over 700. The centre in St Xavier's in Hazaribag has not been under scrutiny.Just like those who appeared at Oasis School, candidates who took exams at the centre in Jay Jalaram School in Godhra, where the administration engaged in corrupt practices to help a few crack the exams, have not done well. The same holds true for the one at Hardayal Public School in Haryana's Jhajjar which attracted controversy after the examinees there were given grace marks as compensation for not getting full time to finish the paper.The Godhra school, in fact, registered one of the lowest percentages of candidates scoring 600 and above, with none of the 1,836 students who appeared there managing to score more than 700, and only 0.4% (7) scoring 650 or above. Only five of the students who appeared in Jhajjar got 720 despite the help in the form of ""grace marks"". The grace marks were cancelled by NTA, and a retest was conducted. In the Hardayal Public School too, of the 494 aspirants, there were none in the 700 plus category, and just two candidates managed to score 650 and above. A total of 15 candidates scored 600 and above.Even for candidates with scores in 600-650 range, securing a govt college seat will be difficult. While a total of 13 lakh of the 23 lakh examinees qualified, more than 30,000 scored over 650 and are better placed to bag one of the 56,000 seats in govt colleges which charge reasonable fees.The total seats available this year, including private colleges, is 1.1 lakh. Those who scored less than 630 run the risk of not getting a seat at a good medical college.The Godhra case was registered on May 8, three days after the exam, against five people based on information that they had helped 27 medical aspirants cheat. All five were charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating, and criminal breach of trust under sections of IPC. The arrested suspects include Vadodara-based education consultant Parshuram Roy, Jay Jalaram School principal Purushottam Sharma, teacher Tushar Bhatt, and alleged middlemen Vibhor Anand and Arif Vohra.CBI has taken over five cases of alleged malpractice in NEET-UG that were being probed by police in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Bihar.","State and centre-wise medical entrance test result data, made public by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Saturday.

Budget 2024 expectations : In the intricate realm of tax regulations, simplicity holds paramount importance. The current landscape of tax collection at source ( TCS ) and tax deduction at source ( TDS ) is far from straightforward. With varying thresholds and a multiplicity of rates spanning from 0.1% to 40%, navigating these provisions has become akin to navigating a labyrinth, fraught with complexities and pitfalls.This complexity not only creates confusion but also leads to disputes, culminating in the locking up of working capital, hindering growth and development. In light of these challenges, there is a need to rationalize and simplify the provisions to promote clarity and efficiency.It should be kept in mind that withholding tax is a vicarious collection of tax and that the tax authorities can always have recourse to the primary taxpayer. Even in the case of non-resident taxpayers, the tax authorities can have recourse to treaty provisions for assistance in tax collection. There is also a comprehensive information collection system in place to obtain data on income and transactions such as Annual Information Statements, returns filed for Specified Financial Transactions, declaration of remittances in Form 15CA and 15CB, etc . Apart from the income-tax system, the government collects information about transactions under other laws such as GST. Accordingly, the government may contemplate the following measures:Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman The current plethora of TDS rates and provisions engenders a convoluted system that needs simplification. To this end, the government may undertake the formulation of a comprehensive roadmap aimed at reducing the prevailing disparity in TDS provisions and rates. By consolidating payments into two or three categories, the TDS framework can be streamlined, fostering a more cohesive and comprehensible system. Several disputes arise not because of non-deduction but only because of differing views on the rate of tax. These disputes can be minimized if the number of rates is rationalized.The essence of income-tax lies in levy of tax on income, rather than on expenses. Given that GST already applies to most expenses, the imposition of TCS appears redundant. A prudent course of action would entail either the abolition or the rationalization of TCS provisions, eliminating superfluous layers of taxation and promoting efficiency within the tax regime.This is more so as regards the imposition of TCS on the sale of goods and TDS on the purchase of goods. This poses a formidable challenge characterized by compliance ambiguity. While in theory only one provision will apply, in several practical situations such a determination is difficult and time consuming. To mitigate these challenges, a harmonized approach is imperative, whereby one of the two provisions (preferably TCS) is dropped. Alternatively, regular taxpayers may be afforded the flexibility to opt for lower or nil tax deduction/collection certificates.Such pragmatic measures will not only simplify compliance but also enhance the ease of doing business, fostering a conducive environment for economic growth.Ambiguities surrounding the definition of critical terms such as ""goods"" undermine the efficacy of the tax framework, giving rise to interpretational discrepancies and disputes. To address this issue, precise definitions must be formulated, aligning with related statutes to obviate confusion and ease compliance.The absence of explicit provisions pertaining to credit for taxes paid outside India imparts an element of rigidity within the tax framework, hindering the facilitation of foreign tax credit (FTC). To address this lacuna, employers should be permitted to provide credit for taxes paid abroad while withholding taxes on salaries, with requisite amendments being made to facilitate the disclosure of FTC in relevant forms.Employees of multinationals are often provided with an option to participate in the employee stock option plan of the overseas parent. Acquisition of such shares by employees is being treated as a payment under LRS which is subject to levy of TCS. Such taxpayers are already paying taxes on income arising from exercise of stock options as a prerequisite which are deducted by the employer. Levy of both TDS and TCS impacts cash flow for employees since stock options are perquisites in kind and not in cash and they will be able to claim credit of TCS only after filing the return of income. To alleviate this burden, amendments may be enacted, enabling the adjustment of any TCS collected on such remittances against the TDS on salaries.Ambiguities surrounding the withholding of taxes on year-end provisions necessitate resolution to ensure fairness and certainty. Withholding should be predicated upon the actual crystallization of expenses, rather than estimations and avoiding a hyper-technical approach in favor of a pragmatic approach that engenders ease of compliance.There are certain overlapping provisions, such as whether a particular service is a ‘technical service' or a 'contract for work' (194J v. 194C) or whether it is ‘professional service’ or ‘technical service’ (194 J(a) v 194J (b)), payment for lease or use of plant and machinery (194-I v. 194J). These overlapping engenders confusion and inefficiencies. To rectify these anomalies, efforts must be made to elucidate and clarify existing provisions, fostering coherence and consistency.According to section 201, if a person who is required to deduct TDS fails to do so, or after deducting TDS fails to deposit the same with the government, he shall be deemed to be an assessee in default. This could result in a penalty under section 221. In addition, non-deduction could lead to a penalty under section 271C. This represents a potential double burden on taxpayers. By streamlining penalty provisions, the framework may be rendered more equitable so that double jeopardy is avoided.Disallowance may occur when taxes are not withheld as per section 40(a)(i) or (ia), and separately demands may be raised under section 201(1) for these omissions. Eliminating this duplication could be achieved by abolishing disallowance under section 40(a)(i) or (ia) as section 201(1) is adequate to compensate for the loss of revenue. Alternatively, a clarification may be inserted that only one of the two provisions will apply.The measures proposed above have the potential to streamline withholding provisions and alleviate the administrative burden on deductors. It may also be kept in mind that the deductors are performing the task of tax collection on behalf of the government. It is reasonable to expect that deductors are fairly compensated for undertaking the responsibility. This could be achieved through the payment of fees commensurate with the workload or the revenue collected.",Tax collection at source and tax deduction at source ( TDS) is far from straightforward. The current plethora of TDS rates and provisions engenders a convoluted system that needs simplification. The government may undertake the formulation of a comprehensive roadmap aimed at reducing the prevailing disparity in TDS provisions and rates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111898479,imgsize-222246,width-400,resizemode-4/111898479.jpg"
Disabled candidate not given any service despite clearing UPSC 4 times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disabled-candidate-not-given-any-service-despite-clearing-upsc-4-times/articleshow/111895006.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'Cerebral palsy allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy?

In the midst of the row over trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar allegedly misusing the disability quota, a case has surfaced of a candidate with muscular dystrophy being denied any service despite having cleared the civil services four times.Kartik Kansal, who studied mechanical engineering in IIT Roorkee, is currently a scientist in Isro, a post for which he was selected through all-India central recruitment.Kartik, who has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14, was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829).In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS, since that year those ranked 272 and 273 got IAS. However, in 2021, muscular dystrophy was not included in the list of conditions in functional classification eligible for IAS.Muscular dystrophy was included in the list for Indian Revenue Service (income Tax) Group A and Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise), which were his second and third choices.In 2019, when Kartik Kansal got 813 rank, he could easily have been allotted a service as there were 15 vacancies for locomotor disability and only 14 were filled. In 2021, there were seven vacancies in the locomotor disability category and only four were filled. He ranked number one in the category.The medical board in AIIMS certified that he had muscular weakness and both his arms and legs were affected by muscular dystrophy. Inexplicably, for IAS, persons with both arms and legs affected are eligible but persons with muscular dystrophy are not. The board noted that he ""can do manipulation with fingers with difficulty and can do mobility with motorised wheelchair"". It also certified that he could see, hear speak, communicate, read and write though he could not stand, walk, pull, push, lift, crouch, bend, kneel, jump or climb. Though his original disability certificate put his level of disability at 60%, the AIIMS medical board deemed it 90%.A retired IAS officer, Sanjeev Gupta, took up Kartik's cause and tweeted in his support pointing out that it was a travesty of justice that Kartik who wrote the civil services without even using a scribe except for help in going to the toilet, and who met all the physical requirements for the job of IAS and IRS was not given any service.When he sought the reason for rejection through the central portal for grievance redressal, he got a reply stating: ""PWBD candidates are allocated service as per the functional classification and physical requirements prescribed by different cadre controlling authorities. There were no matching services at your turn as per your rank.""""Why should functional classifications and physical requirements for similar nature of work vary across services? If cerebral palsy is allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy? Thankfully, since 2024 everything has been merged into one. There will be no such errors now. As per the new merged criteria too, Kartik is eligible to get IAS and true justice will be done by giving him IAS if there is a carry forward vacancy from previous years. This will partly undo the injustice meted out to him till now,"" said Gupta.""By joining the civil services, I wanted to prove that even people like me can do it. But I cannot comment further on the issue since it is sub judice,"" said Kartik, whose case pertaining to this issue is pending in Central Administrative Tribunal.","Kartik Kansal has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14. He was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829) In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895386,imgsize-1111128,width-400,resizemode-4/111895386.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Skewed distribution of rainfall in June-July saw nine states , including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49% whereas six states, including four in the south peninsula, reported excess to large excess of cumulative rainfall during June 1-July 20.State-wise, Jharkhand reported the highest deficit (49%) while Tamil Nadu recorded the highest surplus (83%) than their respective normal rainfall during the period.Overall, the country reported over 1% of deficit in cumulative rainfall with northwest (14% deficit) and east & northeast (12% deficit) India taking the biggest hit as on Saturday. Deficit was slightly reduced in the past 24 hours due to rains in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh caused by a depression over the Odisha coast.Region-wise, central India has no deficit, whereas the south peninsula reported 26% more than normal rainfall so far. Barring a few days of expected good rainfall this month, the overall situation may not improve much.There is a possibility of a weak phase of monsoon in early Aug due to delay in formation of La Nina - a climate condition associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. It is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. Rainfall situation in the deficit zones (northwest and east & northeast) will improve with the formation of La Nina in the later part of next month or in early Sept.The deficit, however, has so far not affected the kharif (summer sown) crop sowing operation as a large part of monsoon core zone (areas dependent on seasonal rains for farming operations) in the country received normal rainfall this month, improving even water storage in the major 150 reservoirs in many states. Data from Central Water Commission shows that the overall live storage improved from 20% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs on June 27 to 29% on July 18.The overall acreage of kharif crops, including paddy, pulses and oilseeds, showed a higher sown area this year so far compared to the corresponding period last year. A huge deficit (11%) of rainfall in June delayed the sowing operation but farmers could increase acreage during the month with the help of groundwater and other irrigation facilities, compared to the same period last year when India reported a slightly less (9%) deficit in 2023.Surprisingly, farmers so far this season don't appear enthused by the pitch around millets, nutri-cereals, which show decline in acreage at a time when over 60% of the kharif sowing operation is complete in the country. Their acreage as on Friday declined by 8% compared to the corresponding period last year, whereas the acreage of paddy rose by 7%.Higher total acreage can be attributed to focus on sowing of pulses and oilseeds, which reported over 15 lakh hectares (21% increase) and 12 lakh hectares (8% increase), respectively, more sown area as on Friday. A better prospect of procurement of paddy, pulses and oilseeds encouraged farmers to opt for these crops instead of millets whose procurement could not match the popular crops despite govt's focus on it during 'International Year of Millet' last year.Acreage data, released by the ministry on Friday, shows that the total area under coverage for all kharif crops has risen to 704 lakh hectares till July 19 against 680 lakh hectares in the same period last year.","Nine states, including Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Bihar, facing a significant rain deficit in the range of 20-49%.

KOLKATA: Bengal Police on Saturday registered an FIR against steel firm CEO Dinesh Saraogi for alleged sexual assault on a 28-year-old woman on a July 16 Kolkata-Abu Dhabi flight. Separately, Vulcan Green Steel , the Jindal Group firm that Saraogi heads, placed him on "" administrative leave and appointed an independent third-party"" for an internal probe.Saraogi has been booked under provisions that could land him in jail for up to five years on conviction.The FIR was filed after the woman's parents went to Kolkata airport police station and submitted a formal complaint. The woman was on her way to the US when Saraogi allegedly showed her porn and groped her. She had described her ordeal in a detailed social media post.""I wasn't able to forgive myself for letting the man go. But now that a case has been registered, I hope I will get justice,"" the woman told TOI from Boston on Saturday. Saraogi was detained after disembarking at Abu Dhabi but was let off as the woman had a connecting flight to Boston and was unable to go to the police station there to lodge an official complaint.Saraogi has been booked under sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 75 (sexual harassment) and 79 (uttering words or making sound or gesture or exhibit any object that insults the modesty of a woman and intrudes upon her privacy) of Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), said police.""We will record the woman's statement over video call as she is in the US and will proceed with the investigation,"" said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police. Kolkata airport falls under Bidhannagar Police.Police were trying to reach Saraogi in Oman, where he is currently based, and a notice will be sent to his registered addresses to appear for investigation, the officer said.Speaking to TOI on Saturday, the woman's father explained further why his daughter could not lodge the complaint in Abu Dhabi itself. ""The Kolkata-Abu Dhabi flight was already 40 minutes late and the only flight to Boston for that day would have departed in barely an hour. She couldn't take the risk as she had a visa compliance that required her to re-enter the country within a certain time frame and she couldn't afford a 24-hour delay,"" the father said. He expressed happiness with the cooperation of the Bengal police in lodging the FIR.TOI's multiple calls to Saraogi on Saturday went unanswered. There was no response to text messages, either. Saraogi is CEO (projects) of Vulcan Green Steel, a sister concern of Jindal Shadeed Iron and Steel and promoted by the Jindal Group. Vulcan is setting up a steel plant in Oman.The woman's social media post describing the alleged sexual assault in the Etihad Airways flight had prompted Jindal Group chief and BJP MP Naveen Jindal to assure her of ""strictest necessary action"" against the perpetrator.In a statement on Saturday, Vulcan Green Steel put out a statement saying it was ""deeply concerned about the allegations involving a senior executive in our company"". ""We recognise the gravity of the situation and are committed to address it with utmost seriousness and urgency. To maintain impartiality, we are appointing an independent credible third party to lead the investigation,"" the statement read.Jindal Steel - the listed entity of the group - submitted a clarification on the allegations against Saraogi to stock exchanges after the BSE and NSE sought an explanation on the matter.The clarification to the exchanges, sent late Friday, says Saraogi had resigned as director of Jindal Steel on March 28, 2023. ""Saraogi is no longer associated with the company in any capacity. We would like to emphasise that the company upholds a zero-tolerance policy towards any incidents of this nature as reported in the news article under reference,"" Jindal Steel's reply to BSE and NSE states.","Dinesh Saraogi has been booked under provisions that could land him in jail for up to five years on conviction.

This rare brain infection , caused by free-living amoeba present in contaminated waters, has claimed several lives in Kerala in recent times.Health minister Veena George announced the release of a technical guideline aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and treating this condition.Due to the limited scientific studies and reports available on this rare disease, the government decided to develop a comprehensive guideline based on existing research and observations.To further advance the understanding of amoebic meningoencephalitis, a panel will be established in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This panel will focus on conducting additional studies and research related to the disease. Minister George has instructed both government and private hospitals to adhere strictly to the guidelines provided.The health department's previously issued advisory said, ""Bathing in stagnant water and diving in water should be avoided as much as possible as this disease has been reported in Kerala. Water in theme parks and swimming pools should be properly chlorinated to ensure that it is clean.""Minister Veena George urged individuals experiencing prolonged fever or other symptoms such as shortness of breath with fever, excessive palpitation, chest pain, slurred speech, loss of consciousness, blood in sputum, or excessive fatigue to seek expert treatment.The most recent victim of this rare brain infection in Kerala was a 14-year-old boy who passed away earlier this month, marking the fourth case reported in the state since May, with all patients being children.According to medical experts, amoebic meningoencephalitis occurs when free-living, non-parasitic amoebae bacteria enter the body through the nose from contaminated water. The amoeba responsible for this condition, Naegleria fowleri, thrives in warm freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs.Once the amoeba enters the body, it travels to the brain, causing a rare and often fatal infection of the brain and its surrounding tissues, known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Before the recent cases, this disease was reported in the coastal district of Alappuzha in Kerala in 2023 and 2017.",Kerala health department issues special guidelines for the treatment of amoebic meningoencephalitis.

"Ahead of Budget, JDU, TDP go easy on special category demand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-budget-jdu-tdp-go-easy-on-special-category-demand/articleshow/111909623.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days before the Union Budget is placed in Parliament, major pressure from NDA partners JDU and TDP seems to have eased as both did not press for 'special category' status for Bihar and Andhra at Sunday's all-party meeting and instead suggested that there could be special packages to meet specific requirements.While JDU working president Sanjay Jha flagged the issue of special category, a demand backed by RJD and Chirag Paswan, he also appeared to appreciate that it may be tough to implement it due to ""technical reasons"" and focused on provision in the Budget for 'vishesh sahayata' or special assistance, focused on areas such as flood control, where the state spends thousands of crores.Party sources also indicated that JDU has realised that it was not possible to meet the demands in this Budget itself.Similarly, TDP again raised the issue of assistance for Amaravati and projects such as Polavaram, while steering clear of specific reference to a special package. Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu has submitted a list of projects, including an oil refinery, on which it wants Centre's announcements, with some of them sought in the Budget.As reported by TOI on July 15, JDU has flagged flood control as a priority issue given that it involves water flowing from Nepal, which cannot be dealt with at the state level. On Sunday, Jha highlighted how Bihar CM has repeatedly flagged the demand for special status but provided greater leeway to Union FM Nirmala Sitharman who will present the Budget on Tuesday in allocating funds for infrastructure and specific projects in the state.After the meeting, TDP MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu said party lawmakers have sought more time during the Budget session that starts on Monday to highlight the issues on which white papers have been released.While the Centre has repeatedly said that a special category status cannot be accorded now, given the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the demand has not gone away with BJD demanding the tag for Odisha pointing that BJP had promised it as part of its 2014 poll campaign. Odisha is now among the better performers on fiscal parameters.Special category status, which was originally designed for hilly and border states, ensured that the Centre provided additional funds.While Andhra has a weak fiscal position, Naidu and his team have realised that it will be more prudent to focus on getting their specific demands addressed. TDP's rival YSR Congress, however, demanded the status for the state, something that Jairam Ramesh of Congress, which has been encouraging TDP to up the ante on the demand for special category tag, highlighted.""In today's all-party meeting of floor leaders chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, the JDU functionary demanded special status of Bihar. The YSRCP member demanded special status for Andhra. Strangely, the TDP member kept quiet on the matter,"" he tweeted.",JDU and TDP did not press for'special category' status for Bihar and Andhra.
