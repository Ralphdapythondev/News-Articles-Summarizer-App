‘No Choice But To Flee’

A History of Violence

Fight For Survival

A Question Of Identity

Still

Stateless

Waiting On CAA

Bijoy Das was 20 when he found himself left in the middle of the treacherous Dandakaranya forests of central India. More than 50 years later, he still shudders to think of the circumstances that forced him and countless other Hindus to leave their ancestral home in the then East Pakistan and seek refuge in India. Circumstances that are echoed again in the reports of violence against minorities in Bangladesh following the recent ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina.As more Bangladeshi Hindus mass at the border to seek shelter in a new country, the settlers from the previous decades find themselves reliving their story of loss, displacement and the long wait for legal recognition from Indian govt.Now 72, Das’s voice still quavers when he recalls the funeral of his sister back in his village. “They dragged her away. She kept screaming for help. As a young boy, I could only stand petrified. She was raped and killed. Her name was Dulaan. We later found her body in the river,” he says staring out of the window of his hut in Pakhanjore village on the southern tip of the Maoist heartland of Bastar. The area is more than 1,400km away from the home he left behind by the banks of Laukhati river, 250km from Dhaka.Standing next to Das, an elderly Somaresh Singha recounts a chilling tale of escape. “My father walked out of his burning home in a burqa, helped by sympathetic Muslim neighbours in Charbat village in Faridpur district. Mobs were on a killing spree and had kidnapped scores of girls. There was no choice but to flee,” he says.Das and Singha’s families crossed over to India on foot. Once here, they were bundled into trains or trucks and brought to Mana tran- sit camp near Raipur, then in Madhya Pradesh (now part of Chhattisgarh). After sheltering for months in tents in dense forests, they were settled in hamlets that are now part of the Maoist Red corridor. There are 2.8 lakh East Bengali refugees spread across 300 camps in these forests, including in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district.The killing and persecution in East Pakistan had begun long before the world woke up to it in 1971. The 1964 Dhaka riots, sparked by Kashmir’s Hazratbal shrine incident, pointed to East Pakistan’s descent into intolerance. Operation Searchlight of 1970-71, led by Pakistani army and Razakar militia, marked a period of unspeakable agony for millions of Bengali Hindus.Kalikrishna Biswas, 75, whose entire family was massacred, says “the Razakar militia unleashed by the Pakistan army were brutal”. As violence increased, lakhs fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs.Amar Mandal, originally from Khulna district, recalls crossing the Padma river at night, wading through waterlogged fields as mothers pressed down on their children’s mouths to muffle cries that could betray their presence. He was separated for years from his father, who had stayed back. “One day, a telegram came from my father. He was standing at the Indian border, having borrowed money to reach there. He was lucky to be reunited with his family in Gadchiroli,” says Mandal.But the struggle for Mandal and the thousands like him didn’t end when they reached India. As they tried to start a new life, they found they had a new threat to deal with inside the dense forests. “Many children and elderly were mauled by tigers. There DhakaBangladesh Kolkata 1,400km is not a single village where people didn’t fall prey to wild animals. Slowly, we cleared the forests and made the place habitable and grew crops,” says Sunil Biswas, a settler since 1970. But the land was infertile and the produce barely enough to feed their families. “After each harvest, we would look for odd jobs to make ends meet,” he adds.Many refugees sought to return to the newly formed Bangladesh post 1971, but efforts in that direction proved abortive. Biswas says the 1979 ‘Marichjhapi massacre’ in the Sundarbans “by police in Leftruled West Bengal doused any hope of getting closer home”. “We took Dandakaranya to be our abode and made peace with the wild,” he adds.But relations with the local tribals have been testy. “Initially, the adivasis were indifferent towards us, but tensions have grown over the years,” says one of the settlers. Sporadic campaigns to oust refugees have sparked fears among settlers. “We are scared. We pray that Pakhanjore does not end up becoming like Bangladesh,” he says.The residents of these refugee hamlets have held on to their Bengali culture and beliefs. In ‘Ghot’ or village No.53, the sound of evening prayers echoes through the air. A red ‘gamcha’ tied with rice and jaggery — a lucky charm — adorns each doorway. Inside, images of ‘Lokkhi Thakur’ (Goddess Laxmi) grace the walls.Settlers in Dandakaranya can be divided into two groups: those who came via official channels from East Pakistan between 1964 and 1971, and those who migrated after the formation of Bangladesh in 1971. The first group received a ‘border slip’ as proof of their refugee status. Others settled without documents. Some managed to carry only a few valuables or just the family deity or a photograph.For first-generation refugees like Jyotishchandra Sarkar, the effort to establish a home has been lifelong. “We broke rocks, cleared forests and built a liveable place in the wilds,” says Sarkar, now 87. Today, the border slip of 1985 is his only identity proof.Sukhendu Chakraborty, 68, a resident of Ghot No.20 in Gadchiroli, says they managed to flourish “despite the identity crisis and acute hardships”. “In those years, there was hardly any govt footprint here. Nowadays, officials and netas visit these forests with commandos and minesweepers. But we made peace with nature and the inhabitants. Adversity has hardened our will to survive, but we pray for stability and recognition,” he says.Decades after they arrived in India, Chakraborty and countless others remain stateless. They cultivated the land, raised families, and found a livelihood, but the struggle to become Indian citizens continues.Many have managed to find a footing, some have benefited from govt programmes that gave them jobs, land and the chance to build small businesses and farms. However, their progress has not been without setbacks. Bengali medium schools, which were once specially set up by the govt for refugee children, have been shut down while many claim they are excluded from govt schemes. Many settlers till the land without official ownership.“We have lived here for decades, but we are still waiting for recognition,” Bipin Bepari, a member of Nikhil Bharat Bangali Samanbay Samiti (NBBSS), voices the frustration of many.Jatin Karmakar (name changed), a grocery shop owner, is euphoric that his son landed a corporate job. While he leads a regular life in India, complexities still surround his legal status. “I have an Aadhaar card and a voter ID, but I am still not an Indian citizen,” he says. Settlers say they need the bor der slip for citizenship documentation, which Karmakar doesn’t have.Kalikrishna Ghose came to India in 1982 but, like many others, finds himself occupying a grey zone when it comes to citizenship. “I came through an agent. There are many in Bangladesh who help you cross the border. After staying in Kolkata for a while, I settled in Chamorshi in Gadchiroli in 1989, where my kin were already living,” he says.The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) seemed like a beacon of hope for these refugees. CAA, enacted in 2019, paves the way to Indian citizenship for religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who arrived in India by 2014. However, many settlers have found the process difficult, especially those who lack documents to prove their eligibility. “Many are not applying because they don’t have documents,” says Subhodh Biswas, president of NBBSS. Of 221 applications filed by them so far under CAA, only six were successful.The ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh has triggered another wave of attacks on Bengali Hindus. “My brother keeps calling me on WhatsApp, asking me to come and take him to India,” says Krishna Bose of Chamorshi. “No one is buying our property there. They want Hindus to abandon everything and leave so it can be an easy smash-and-grab,” he says.Recently, about 10,000 Bengali settlers gathered at Pakhanjore and urged the Centre to open its borders for Hindus from Bangladesh. Biswas says his outfit plans to hold similar rallies across Bengali pockets before launching an agitation on Sept 23 at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.","More than 2.8 lakh East Bengali refugees spread across 300 camps in these forests, including in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district.

Why should birth control measures target Hindus only: RSS magazine's editor Prafulla Ketkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-should-birth-control-measures-target-hindus-only-rss-mags-editor/articleshow/113360151.cms,"Prafulla Ketkar, editor of RSS-affiliated magazine Organiser, questioned why population control measures target only Hindus and called for increased social awareness among them.

NAGPUR: Why should only Hindus be subjected to population control measures, questioned the editor of RSS-affiliated magazine Organiser, Prafulla Ketkar , on Saturday.""The proportion of Hindus has reduced to 75% due to a Hindu mindset. There is a need to create social awareness by changing the narrative about birth control . Today, many families have lost confidence in the institution of marriage.Even when they marry, couples often choose to have only one child,"" he said.Ketkar argued that maintaining the country's demographic balance requires awakening among Hindus. He claimed that concept of birth control was a strategy by foreign forces to reduce the population, which, he said, is the country's most significant asset.He noted that the birth control campaign led by late Congress functionary Sanjay Gandhi was funded by Ford Foundation and questioned what the American organisation aimed to achieve through this.Ketkar also criticised evangelist forces and neo-Left groups, who label the fight against religious fundamentalism as Islamophobia, suggesting that they are acting against India.Responding to a question whether India needed to prepare civilians for a situation similar to Israel's, he said that the Agniveer scheme was introduced with that purpose in mind. The scheme aims to produce military-trained individuals who can be deployed in a crisis, he told TOI on the sidelines of his talk on ""Global Uncertainties and Resurgent Bharat,"" organised by NGO Vishwamanthan Research Foundation.","Ketkar argued that maintaining the country's demographic balance requires awakening among Hindus.

In the audio tape, two persons are heard purportedly planning an attack on protesting doctors to allegedly blame it on Bengal's governing TMC.Cops said Sanjib Das , the first suspect arrested on Friday, had admitted that one of the voices on the tape was his and that he gave away Dasgupta's name.Dasgupta was then picked up from a Left activists' sit-in site Saturday.Releasing the clip, Ghosh said some Left and ultra-Left party workers had conspired to attack the protesting doctors while their team had gone Thursday to meet CM Mamata Banerjee.

Why it is not classified as a cyclone?

Cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh: Depression over North India

Week 1: September 12 to 18

Week 2: September 19 to 25



NEW DELHI: A depression that formed over central India is predicted to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and nearby regions in the coming two to three days, according to the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ).The latest IMD update indicated that the system was situated approximately 50 kilometres south-southeast of Agra and 50 kilometres north-northeast of Gwalior.It is anticipated to continue moving towards the north-northeast and gradually weaken on Friday. However, its impact will be felt across a wide region before it dissipates.From September 12 to 14, the state is anticipated to experience light to moderate rainfall, with isolated areas receiving heavy to extremely heavy precipitation. This could lead to localized flooding, landslides, and waterlogging in vulnerable areas.Both eastern and western regions are expected to face heavy to extremely heavy rainfall during this period. The IMD has warned of moderate to high flash flood risks , particularly in west Uttar Pradesh. Rainfall intensity could reach between 115.6 mm and 204.4 mm (very heavy) and exceed 204.5 mm (extremely heavy).Additionally, very heavy rainfall is expected in isolated areas of Delhi on the 12th, as well as in West Uttar Pradesh on both the 12th and 13th of September.Light to moderate rain is forecasted, with periods of heavy rainfall expected between September 12 and 15. Urban areas may face disruptions due to waterlogging and potential flooding.West Rajasthan is likely to receive heavy rainfall on September 12, while east Rajasthan will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall on September 12 and 13.Heavy rainfall is expected on September 12, with moderate to heavy rain continuing over the following days. This may result in surface runoff and flooding in low-lying areas.The depression follows a period of substantial rainfall across central India. From September 5 to 11, 2024, extreme heavy rainfall was reported in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh, with very heavy rainfall in Gujarat and East Rajasthan. The cumulative all-India rainfall for this period was 50.9 mm, which is 14% above the long period average (LPA). The seasonal rainfall departure from June 1 to September 11, 2024, stands at +8% above the LPA.The current system is not classified as a cyclone because it does not meet the intensity criteria set for cyclones. While it has brought significant rainfall and has the potential for severe weather, it lacks the sustained high wind speeds and organised cyclonic circulation typical of tropical cyclones.According to IMD, the depression that was previously over Northwest Madhya Pradesh has moved north-northeastwards at a speed of 10 km/h in the past six hours. By 8:30 AM IST on 12th September, it was positioned over Southwest Uttar Pradesh, near 27.0°N latitude and 78.5°E longitude, approximately 50 km east-southeast of Agra. It continued its movement north-northeastwards, accelerating to 13 km/h, and by 11:30 AM IST, it was centred near 27.3°N latitude and 78.7°E longitude, about 70 km east-northeast of Agra, 90 km southeast of Aligarh, 130 km north-northeast of Gwalior, and 140 km south-southwest of Bareilly. The system is expected to maintain its strength through the 12th of September before gradually weakening on the 13th. Continuous monitoring is being carried out by Doppler Weather Radars based in Delhi and Lucknow.An upper-air cyclonic circulation has formed over Southeast Bangladesh and its neighbouring regions in the lower and middle levels of the troposphere. A low-pressure area is expected to develop over coastal Bangladesh and the northern Bay of Bengal within the next 24 hours. Following this, the system is predicted to slowly move west-northwestwards, potentially strengthening into a depression over coastal West Bengal and the adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal within 48 hours.Extremely heavy rainfall is forecast for isolated regions of Uttarakhand on the 12th and 13th of September, while West Uttar Pradesh is expected to experience similar conditions on the 12th, with continued heavy rain on the 13th. Other regions, including Haryana, Chandigarh-Delhi, East Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh, and East Rajasthan, are likely to see isolated heavy rainfall on the 12th.

Heated debate between BJP & opposition at JPC meet on waqf bill, officials asked tough questions

At a parliamentary panel meeting, top government officials faced intense questioning over the Waqf Amendment Bill. Opposition members argued that ministries were not independently assessing the draft legislation but following official directives. The bill aims to remove encroachments on government lands and expedite development projects, sparking heated debates between BJP and opposition lawmakers.

Hyderabad: A delegation of the Telangana Waqf Board has submitted a memorandum to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (renamed as Joint Working Committee) on the proposed Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in New Delhi and rejected the Bill, pointing out 41 proposed amendments in it as “detrimental to Muslims and aimed at usurping waqf properties”.The delegation was led by Telangana Waqf Board chairman Syed Azmatullah Husseni, with AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, four-term board member and former central waqf council member Syed Akbar Nizamuddin, Telangana Urdu Academy and Minorities Finance Corporation chairpersons Taher Bin Hamdan and Obedulla Kothwal respectively, and the board’s chief executive officer Mohammed Asadullah, among others, giving their opinion on the amendments proposed in the proposed bill.It was on August 26 that a special meeting of the Telangana Waqf Board unanimously resolved to reject the Centre’s Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, thereby becoming the first such board in the country to formally oppose the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act.Sources told TOI that the delegation members, including Azmatullah Husseni, Akbar Nizamuddin, and Owaisi, pointed out 41 proposed amendments point by point and explained how damaging they were to the Muslims and waqf properties. For example, they said while the Centre proposes to remove the provision of non-Muslims donating their properties to waqf, it at the same time wants two non-Muslim members on the waqf boards in every state.The JWC, which called for the hearing on Friday, laid down the condition that the details of the meeting should not be divulged anywhere else.","Muslim community leaders met NCP MP Suresh Mhatre to voice their opposition to the Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024.

India set to ink $4 billion deal for 31 Predator drones with US in October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-ink-4-billion-deal-for-31-predator-drones-with-us-in-oct/articleshow/113359442.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is getting set to ink the mega deal for 31 weaponised MQ-9B `hunter-killer’ Predator drones with the US next month, with the defence ministry now finalizing the `draft note’ for the finance ministry and then the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security.The report of the MoD’s contract negotiation committee has been “submitted and accepted” for the government-to-government deal for which the US had earlier quoted a price of $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore), sources told TOI.The development comes as PM Modi is slated to visit the US for the fourth in-person Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 21.“The contract should be inked in mid-Oct. The costing, setting up of a MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here, performance-based logistics support and other such issues have been finalized after hard negotiations,” a source said.While there will be no direct transfer of technology (ToT) in the deal, the 31 remotely-piloted aircraft will be assembled here, with the drone-manufacturer General Atomics making an investment in India and sourcing over 30 per cent of the components from Indian companies.Drone-manufacturer General Atomics will also provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such high-altitude, long endurance drones indigenously.TOI was the first to report last month that India was fast-tracking the techno-commercial negotiations for the deal, under which 15 Sea Guardian drones are earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, in the backdrop of both China and Pakistan steadily boosting their fleets of armed UAVs.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 MQ-9B drones will come with 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment. India will also equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO, in the future.Apart from long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and over-the-horizon targeting, the drones can undertake anti-warship and anti-submarine warfare operations.This becomes crucial in the backdrop of the Chinese Navy’s increasing footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), with its submarines capable of posing a major strategic challenge to India in the maritime domain after the land borders.“China has been systematically deploying its survey and research vessels in the IOR to map oceanographic and other data useful for underwater domain awareness and submarine operations. Chinese nuclear-powered submarines, which as of now come to the IOR occasionally, will be on regular deployments to the region in the near future,” an officer said.India, hoping to get the initial deliveries of the fighter-sized drones in two to three years, plans to deploy them at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the IOR and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders.","The report of the MoD’s contract negotiation committee has been “submitted and accepted” for the government-to-government deal for which the US had earlier quoted a price of $3.9 billion.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures.

Though there were many skipped heartbeats on the Chhattisgarh Express (Amritsar to Bilaspur), no casualties were reported.The incident happened close to the Chambal riverbank, between Morena's Hetampur railway station and Dholpur in Rajasthan. Chhattisgarh Express was travelling at 130 kmph when it hit the weakened track. Passengers were startled by the sudden tilt.Thankfully, the gateman on site spotted this and immediately notified the station master. He alerted the loco pilot, who applied emergency brakes , bringing the train to a halt.Railway engineers arrived on scene shortly thereafter. They found that the soil beneath the track had caved in by up to 6 feet.The train remained stationary for about an hour before being moved at a cautious speed of 1.5 kmph. The tracks are being repaired and trains are restricted to a max speed of 20 kmph.The collapse is attributed to recent heavy rainfall in the region, which led to soil erosion at two locations on the Morena-Gwalior down track. The affected areas include a section near Chambal river bridge on the Dholpur border and another between pillars 1280/13 and 1280/17, around 2.5 km from Hetampur station.","The Chhattisgarh Express was travelling at 130 kmph when it hit the weakened track.

Rust was observed on the base of the finial. This rust formation could have led to the development of cracks in the stone, causing water seepage.

Khera also alleged that between 2021 and 2024, Puri Buch invested in four overseas exchange-traded funds (ETF) - which are like mutual funds and can be traded on exchanges - including in Global X MSCI China Consumer (CHIQ) and Invesco China Technologies ETF.Neither Sebi nor Puri Buch commented on the fresh accusations. While CHIQ seeks to invest in large-and mid-capital segments of the MSCI China Index classified in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, the second fund is based on the FTSE China Incl A 25% Technology Capped Index, according to information available on websites.On Friday, the Sebi chief and her husband, Dhaval, had dismissed the earlier charges as ""false, incorrect, malicious and motivated"" and said that all disclosures had been made.As a top regulatory official, Puri Buch and her family members are allowed to hold shares and units of mutual funds under Sebi's code of conduct but disclosures are required. Besides, the code does not put any restriction on investment in instruments regulated overseas.Khera sought to invoke the China factor given the restrictions placed by govt on investments with the neighbour following border tension. ""It is deeply concerning to learn that Ms Madhabi P Buch, the Sebi chairperson, has been investing in Chinese funds. When the Prime Minister of India can publicly give China a clean chit, it's hardly surprising that a key regulatory figure is engaging in investments linked to China,"" the Congress spokesperson said. He also questioned the overseas assets and sought to know when they were disclosed.While the Sebi boss and her husband had disclosed on Friday that the former Unilever executive's consulting income was routed via two consulting firms - Agora Partners (Singapore entity) and Agora Advisory (Indian entity), Khera raised questions about Puri Buch's association with the overseas outfit. ""Is it true that Ms Madhabi P Buch was actively involved in Agora Partners PTE (Singapore) as she was a signatory to the bank account?"" he questioned.Khera asked Puri Buch if she or her company has dealt with companies that figured in Panama Papers and Paradise Papers - a reference to exposes on tax evasion and laundering. ""If she does not respond to our questions, then we will give the answers,"" he said.He said Congress will give a detailed reply to the clarifications given by Puri Buch and her husband, which he dubbed as vague.Asked if the party was contemplating legal action, Khera said Congress is waiting for action by the PM and finance minister, while a Trinamool Congress MP has already approached the Lokpal.About Puri Buch's threat to initiate legal action against entities which have illegally obtained her and her husband's income tax returns to cull the information about investments, Khera said Congress has nothing to do with the returns and that it is only discharging its duty as a responsible opposition party of bringing to light questionable details about impropriety that are not known to people.","Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch was trading in "" listed securities "" during her tenure at the agency.

"Congress sticks to Jatavs in Haryana, BJP list shows sub-caste tilt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-sticks-to-jatavs-in-haryana-bjp-list-shows-sub-caste-tilt/articleshow/113356526.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the Haryana elections , Congress has allocated 12 tickets to Jatavs and aligned sub-castes within the Dalit community , and five to non-Jatavs, showing its continuing reliance on the dominant Scheduled Caste community as its support base, in line with its lukewarm response to the debate on sub-categorisation .But the in-office BJP , according to an analysis of candidates, has fielded nine non-Jatavs and eight Jatavs, a clear reflection of its aggressive approval of sub-division of SCs.The intra-Dalit preference of parties is significant in the light of the recent Supreme Court judgment which green flagged the controversial measure of sub-categorisation, roiling the already volatile politics around the marginalised community.Haryana holds a special place for Dalits, as it ranks second in the country in terms of the share of the community's population, with Punjab at the top.Sub-categorisation implies division of total reservation among ""better-off SCs"" and ""backward SCs"" for ""equitable distribution"" of benefits.Haryana has 17 reserved seats where only Dalits can contest. But it is the varied preference of sub-castes that gives away the heterogenous nature of the sprawling community and, at the same time, betrays how sub-castes are aligned politically among competitors.","Haryana holds a special place for Dalits, as it ranks second in the country in terms of the share of the community's population.
